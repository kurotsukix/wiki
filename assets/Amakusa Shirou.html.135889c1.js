One simply needs to sincerely care about others.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> But then, what about saving the world?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I thought I understood what that involved, but perhaps I do not have the answer at all.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> What&#39;s necessary is uncompromisable power.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The power of salvation that would equally save, with ruthless efficiency, everything in this world.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Of course, I answered this summon for the purpose of saving humanity.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> But somewhere in my heart I&#39;m searching for that power.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...That&#39;s right. The ruthless salvation that is the Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Take this!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Enemies eliminated. Good work.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Understood. Please keep moving forward.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> After the Incineration of Humanity, we can&#39;t ignore even a small Singularity.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I know you&#39;re busy, but destroying them when they&#39;re small is much more effective.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, both Master and I agree.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This time, Amakusa is helping us, so we should be fine.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Please think nothing of it. A Servant that only speaks in irony would have been finished long ago.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Make full use of me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Doctor, are we going the right way?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Of course. Once you&#39;re through that forest you&#39;ll find a cave.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Let&#39;s hurry!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Please calm down, Master. Easy does it.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Patience is important as well. I&#39;ve been patient for 60 years, so I can be sure of it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...60 years?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Let&#39;s take it easy.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> That&#39;s the right answer, Master. Hurrying won&#39;t lead to good results.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> ...Especially in this unknown forest. We should be cautious since we don&#39;t know what lives here.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;ve been meaning to ask. Amakusa, why do you use Black Keys?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> They didn&#39;t exist in the place and time you were alive in, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> The black what?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> The Black Keys?</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> They&#39;re the Holy Church&#39;s Craft Essence. I don&#39;t know the details, but it&#39;s some kind of ranged weapon that uses Bible fragments.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> There&#39;s no record of you belonging to the Holy Church, and that technology hadn&#39;t been imported into Japan at that time...</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Oh, it&#39;s simple.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> I incarnated during a certain Holy Grail War, then joined the Holy Church after.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Wha\u2013</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> You what!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You incarnated...? There are records of some Servants have been incarnated through the power of the Grail, but...</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> But what I just described contradicts the records in this world. Perhaps what I went through was some occurrence brought forth by an impossible process.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Even so, this form is without a doubt my most useful form as a Servant.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Normally, I am a third-rate Servant who can&#39;t even become a Ruler.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> The best I could possibly hope for is to be a Caster.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Maybe you could get Medea to teach you?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Hahahaha. No way. I&#39;d die.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Mages from the Age of Gods are like... Well, if they are a motorcycle, modern mages like us would be regular bicycles.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Besides, I&#39;m probably more of a simple spellcaster.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> I don&#39;t treat magecraft as something mystical. To me, it&#39;s just useful.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> ...Well, it seems like there are other Servants who feel the same way.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Maybe you could get Edison to teach you?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Edison, huh...</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> I just got an epiphany where a \u201CShin Amakusa Shirou,\u201D conceptually improved with Rocket Arms, is revealed...</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> But if you don&#39;t have the right to be summoned as a Ruler, how can you appear as a Ruler now?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Oh, it&#39;s simple.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Because, in the Holy Grail War where I was incarnated, my Master broke the rules.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Normally Rulers are an eighth class. Their role is to mediate the Holy Grail War; their Master is the Grail itself.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> It is a Ruler&#39;s duty to remain neutral.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> ...But my Master ignored all that and tried to summon one directly. Master wanted to win the war, see.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> A normal Ruler, summoned during a regular Holy Grail War, possesses Command Spells that affect all participating Servants.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> ...Spells so powerful they can even be used to order Servants to commit suicide.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> As such, making a Ruler into a familiar would, in my Master&#39;s eyes, guarantee victory in the war.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> ...And so that&#39;s what my Master did\u2013with me. My summoning as a Ruler was a violation of the rules. It shouldn&#39;t have happened.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> ...But because it did, I was able to be summoned as a Ruler from there on out. I suppose I gained that right.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Of course, unless it&#39;s an urgent matter such as restoring humanity, it&#39;s almost impossible to summon me...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I see.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...So you weren&#39;t summoned as a Ruler because you naturally had the right.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> You were summoned as one because there was a precedence from some other time.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> So then if that is the story, regardless to the particulars, it established a pathway to call you in this form again.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The second summoning was probably much easier.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> I couldn&#39;t win the Holy Grail War I participated in, but through a series of coincidences I gained a physical body.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> ...Oh! It looks like this is not the time to be talking about the past.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Oops, I was so invested in the story I stopped paying attention!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Yeah... Incoming enemies! Watch out!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Doctor, you&#39;re a little late!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> To be honest, I&#39;ve never performed any miracles.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I-Is that so?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But legends unmistakably state that Amakusa Shirou performed miracles...</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> In that sense... Yes, I performed something magical.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> But I did that subconsciously. My own body didn&#39;t realize what it was doing.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> But faith is a strange thing. After I died and became a Heroic Spirit, I was able to perform miracles.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> By miracles, I mean my original Noble Phantasms, \u201CRight Hand - Evil Eater\u201D and \u201CLeft Hand - Xanadu Matrix.\u201D</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m getting an Immortal Chaos Brigade vibe.</p><hr><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Yes, you have the right idea.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Hehehe, I do feel a strange sympathy towards Sakata Kintoki and Fuuma Kotarou.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> I invited Lu Bu too, but...</p><p><strong>Lu Bu:</strong><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png" alt="berserk1">!!!!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> I see. That&#39;s pretty golden!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> Kintoki, what did Lu Bu say?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> Well...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> \u201CUnfortunately, my Noble Phantasm&#39;s name is art, brought to life with strong will and passion. It cannot be changed.\u201D</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> Lame!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> So I couldn&#39;t get Lu Bu to join. What a shame.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Hahaha. I see Chaldea&#39;s Servants are developing some relationships we don&#39;t know about.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Something tells me that&#39;s no laughing matter... But I suppose it&#39;s a good thing if it makes it easier to work together!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...Still, I&#39;m surprised to learn that Amakusa Shirou was a spellcaster.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> And by \u201Cspellcaster,\u201D I suppose you mean you never actually learned magecraft properly, correct?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Yes. It was one of those very rare natural occurrences.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> I was born with the ability to use magecraft. However, no one around me could tell its true nature...</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> And so I was worshipped as a miracle.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Perhaps Mori Souiken kept the rumors from spreading too far.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> At this point, there&#39;s no way to know the truth...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> From what you&#39;re telling me about your magecraft and its uniqueness, the Mage&#39;s Association at the time wouldn&#39;t have let you be, no.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> In any case, it was all in the past\u2013when I was alive. For now, let&#39;s focus on saving this world.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Do you want to save the world?</p><hr><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Yes. I will save everyone. No matter what atrocities they may have committed.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You really are a saint...</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> No, I&#39;m not. Besides, I&#39;m not recognized as one by the Church.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> I try to be one. However, there are things I must let go of in order to reach that point.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> ...Hatred. As long as I have hatred in my heart, I will never be a saint.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Of course, some people, like Jeanne d&#39;Arc, are basically born saints.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Jeanne doesn&#39;t seem to think of herself as a saint.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I hear people teasing her about that sometimes.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> How she sees herself and how others see her are two different things.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> No matter what she believes, I believe she is a saint.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> ...Of course, she probably wishes I didn&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Come to think of it, are you related to Jeanne d&#39;Arc somehow?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> You&#39;re both Rulers, but you don&#39;t seem to get along too well.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Oh, that&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> ...I&#39;ll keep that a secret. It has to do with both of our core beliefs.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> ...Fou!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Wait! The Singularity in that cave is rapidly establishing itself!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It&#39;s fast... What is this!? Hurry! Something bad is happening!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This is...!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> A tainted Grail!? What&#39;s this doing here?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Be careful! The black mud coming out of it corrupts Servants!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> ...Hmm.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Calm down, please. We can just blow it away before it establishes itself.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Th-That&#39;s true, but...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> How?</p><hr><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> With Noble Phantasms, of course. It will be a race against time, but...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I won&#39;t let you do it, Ruler...! This Grail is mine!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> A human...!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> No! That&#39;s no human!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It&#39;s a remnant of a record, created by the Grail mud!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Nurarihyon...!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> No, no. No, no, no. What would a Japanese monster be doing here?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It&#39;s probably the remnants of a record created by the Grail mud.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...Not exactly a common occurrence, but anyway...! Just don&#39;t hold back against it!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Oh, it&#39;s possible it&#39;s someone I fought during the Holy Grail War. But I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t remember that well.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> But if he&#39;s here...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> You... You want this too, don&#39;t you! If this Grail fully forms, it will be a powerful weapon!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> One that surpasses the Fuyuki Grail!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> ...Master, let&#39;s destroy him. Talking to him is a waste of time.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Here we go!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Enemy defeated. Confirmed elimination.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Whoa, whoa! Hurry! The Pseudo-Grail&#39;s like a volcano about to explode!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> As soon as it explodes, it will properly establish itself as a Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Activating Noble Phantasm. Please stand back.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...Something else came out of the mud!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> They just keep coming...!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Hey pretty boy. Is this my first time meeting you? It is, right?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I&#39;m a sewer rat, born from the mud. I got no business with a saint!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> But... I see. I can see you&#39;ve led a hard life.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> That Heroic Spirit smell you&#39;re giving off is pretty damn close to my own!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> And that exhaustion you just can&#39;t shake? Clear as day! That tired state of mind leaves you open to danger...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...but I guess we can&#39;t help it!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> You chose to go through all that! Nobody will sympathize with you!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> You&#39;re right. I have no intention of seeking sympathy. If anything, I am the one who sympathizes with others.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Seriously? Damn, you think just like our new recruit!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> An iron will... No, more like the power to get things done, eh? I&#39;m weak to that stuff. In the sense that it makes me want to puke.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> So...? My being born means that someone here wants this Grail...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Who is it? Who&#39;s the tasteless human? You?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> No way.</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong> I know, right!? I mean, didn&#39;t think it&#39;d be you!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> And it&#39;s not that delicious tender-looking Servant over there, either.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Tender-looking?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Which leaves... Hey now, saint.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Are you serious about joining our side? Only bad guys want the Grail. Everyone knows that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh...? A-Amakusa?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Hahahaha. Hey, you&#39;re kidding me.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...Amakusa?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> ...Don&#39;t worry about me. I know how to deal with Grails.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> I will take this Grail and make good use of it.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> What... Are you insane!? That&#39;s highly corrupted matter!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Even the resistance power of a Ruler has its limits!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> You&#39;ll be corrupted instantly!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Yes, I&#39;m well aware of that.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> But even if it means taking risks... I can&#39;t give up on saving the world.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> So I&#39;ll try to do so every chance I get.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Wait a minute... You want to use the power of destruction to save the world? You might as well start the doomsday clock right now.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> No human, good or evil, can handle the power to save the world.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Right, Master? Did my words move you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I suppose so.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Right???</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Since when were we friends?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Hey now! You may have a point, but still, that hurts!</p><hr><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> ...That mud is right. However, not giving up in the face of adversity is exact what&#39;s necessary for salvation.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Master, please decide.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Will you let me take care of this incomplete Grail?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Nope.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> ...I figured. Then I&#39;m sorry, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...Sorry.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> I see. That leaves me no choice.</p><hr><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> In that case, let&#39;s have ourselves a good old-fashioned Holy Grail War. Winner takes all.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Hahahahaha! Man, you really are like our new recruit!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Especially the way you&#39;ll do whatever it takes!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> But our black-caped recruit always puts so much effort into aesthetics.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> You&#39;re colder, and more efficient. Which makes you impossible to persuade.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Master, you&#39;re gonna have to defeat him.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> And when a Ruler gets out of hand, what you need is an Avenger to stop them!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Lucky you! You won the chance to try out a rare dark Servant!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I won&#39;t last the night anyway. Might as well die in style!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Let&#39;s go, Boss!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> ...It seems... I&#39;m the one who lost this fight.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But the Grail...!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> This is bad. I&#39;m getting you all out of there now!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Without a way to destroy it, you have no choice but to evacuate...!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> No, I will destroy it. Now that I&#39;ve lost, this is my way of taking responsibility.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> ...My conversation with you was worthwhile, A\u014Bra Mainiiu. Farewell.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong> Yeah? If it helped you vent a bit, then I guess it was worth the risk.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong> I&#39;ll let you clean up after yourselves. I&#39;m a slacker at heart, you know. Don&#39;t go knocking on my door too often!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Activating Noble Phantasm. Twin Arm - Big Crunch...!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...That was a close one.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Indeed. But unfortunately, I don&#39;t feel bad at all.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Now then... Fujimaru, you&#39;re his Master.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Since he&#39;s rebelled against you, it&#39;s up to you to decide on his punishment.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Rain check.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Just don&#39;t do it again.</p><hr><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Is that all?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> (Sigh) I had a feeling you&#39;d say something like that...</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Master. To me, the Grail is\u2013no, the power the Grail brings is my greatest desire.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> If the same thing happens again, I can say with almost certainty that I&#39;ll try once more for the Grail.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It can&#39;t be helped.</p><hr><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> It can&#39;t be...helped...?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> ...Um, if it happens again, what will you do, Master?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Will you stop me again?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yes.</p><hr><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> I see... We&#39;ll never see eye to eye on this matter.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s fine.</p><hr><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> What did you say?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;ll stop you as many times as it takes.</p><hr><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> As long as you&#39;re my Master, you&#39;ll stop me? As many times...as it takes?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Well, that&#39;s a problem. As a Servant, I cannot betray my Master.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> ...Very well. As long as you&#39;re my Master, I won&#39;t pursue my dream.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Even if we can&#39;t understand each other, we can fight together. Even if we must someday part, we can still hold hands.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> If you will believe in me like that, I swear that I won&#39;t give in to my desire.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> ...Anyway, at least give me some form of punishment.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> It wouldn&#39;t sit well with me otherwise.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Clean my room, or something...?</p><hr><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Thank you, Master.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> I, Amakusa Shirou Tokisada, will give your room the best cleaning ever!</p><h2 id="let-s-talk-about-evil" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#let-s-talk-about-evil" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Let&#39;s Talk about Evil</h2><p><strong>Narration:</strong> There is nothing helpful to be gained by separating good and evil.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Good people miraculously cause evil to rain down upon us, and the same is true for evil people and good.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...It is instinct itself that gets in the way of doing good. People resort to evil for all manner of reasons.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> To eat... To sleep... To escape pain... To earn praise... To gain respect... To avoid having to think...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> To connect with others... To form bonds... To rest... To have peace of mind... To avoid death...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> That is why, sometimes, people choose evil. It&#39;s just not as simple as telling them to be better.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> ...So I can&#39;t blame the samurai we fought at the Shimabara Rebellion for killing my compatriots and myself.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> ...Of course I can never forgive them for what they did. And I have no desire to do so.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> But would we have been any more merciful had the tables had been turned? I doubt it.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Demanding that others do things we can&#39;t is one of mankind&#39;s worst habits.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Hey, so...

But I&#39;m not about to stop now.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fooou.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> There have been lots of heroes and such who have tried to resolve the problem of evil once and for all...</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> ...but unfortunately, none of them ever succeeded.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Some of them went about it the wrong way... Some of them got bogged down in the details...</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> And some of them were mistaken about what the end result of their endeavor would be.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Strangely enough, it turns out that in order to eradicate evil...</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> ...one must resort to the decidedly evil measure of sacrificing the few for the sake of the many.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> And of course, in doing so, such an endeavor ceases to be good.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> That is the part that tripped up everyone who attempted this, be they hero, genius, or otherwise.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Which is exactly why you shouldn&#39;t lose heart. After all, this is the only option you have.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> I&#39;m talking about the Lostbelts. You seem to be taking their loss pretty hard, after all.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> You may give us orders as our Master, but at the same time you also have your own orders to follow.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I appreciate the thought, but I can&#39;t let myself get used to this.</p><hr><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Yes, that&#39;s true.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Getting used to it would erase one of your key advantages.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Most Servants are merciless, myself included.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> After all, whether it&#39;s for a greater cause, our country, our loved ones, or ourselves, we wield our blades.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> And we would never have become heroes had we not grown accustomed to fighting.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> But you&#39;re an ordinary person. And as long as you remain so, you&#39;ll never get used to that.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> One slight misstep on the path to your destination, and you could even end up with lifelong trauma.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> However, that willingness to hold your ground even as you get hurt, despite not being a hero...</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> ...is also why you shine so bright.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I...think I get it?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> It&#39;s fine if you don&#39;t understand everything.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> As long as you continue to do what you can, that&#39;s all that matters.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I just try to help however I can.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Indeed. That&#39;s all you need to do.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Simply doing what they can is all any human can hope to do.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Expecting anything more requires us to stand on the shoulders of those who came before us.</p><hr><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Oh my, look at the time. I didn&#39;t mean to go on this long. All right, I think I&#39;d better bid you good night now.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Sweet dreams.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> ...There we go.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> I&#39;m sorry, that was more than a little intentional. I expect when [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she} goes to sleep tonight, [\u2642 he&#39;ll /\u2640\uFE0F she&#39;ll} end up wandering into the rift.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> I can&#39;t let [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her} depart this world now, so I&#39;m going to tag along and tie up some loose ends.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> ...Luckily, it should be easy for you to carry me there, right?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Thank you. Now I can finally clean up this mess.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What the!? Where am I!?</p><hr><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Hello again, Master. Can you see how horribly everything is burning here?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> ...Oh? You seem suspicious about something. It&#39;s almost as though you think I&#39;m responsible for us being here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Indeed, I am.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Aaamaaakuuusaaa!?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> That&#39;s me. Amakusa Shirou Tokisada, your faithful Servant.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Hahaha, now you seem more suspicious than ever. Hahaha.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Unfortunately, you&#39;ve every right to be.</p><hr><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> This is as much your nightmare as it is mine.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Do you remember seeing this scenery before?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yeah, I do. This place is\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Indeed. Reality Marble: The Hell of Shimabara...</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> The living hell you once experienced in the Shimousa Province Pseudo-Singularity.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> I too experienced something very similar to it back when I was alive.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> But, why are we seeing this again now?</p><hr><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> That would be my doing. Do you remember what we talked about before bedtime?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> About Lostbelts, and evil, and all that jazz?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> It was through that talk that these memories came back to life and merged with the curses you&#39;ve been accumulating.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Normally, driving such curses away falls to another Servant, but tonight, I asked him to let me handle it.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> ...So yes, this was all intentional. I&#39;m sorry I dragged you into it, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Oh well, I guess it&#39;s okay.</p><hr><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Oh? You really don&#39;t mind? Even though, by all accounts, this is a fairly serious situation?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You had a reason for doing this, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I know you didn&#39;t do this for no reason.</p><hr><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Well, now I&#39;m kind of embarrassed.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> All right, if you trust me that much, I&#39;ll go ahead and tell you everything. No more lies.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> But first...</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> We need to dispose of these riffraff. Let&#39;s talk more once this is over, shall we?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Sounds good!</p><hr><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Now then, as I was saying.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Over the course of your adventures, Master, you&#39;ve been unwittingly collecting some...less than desirable things.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> I speak of the kind of residual feelings wild beasts can only dream about. In a word: grudges.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> And while you may not usually be aware of them, these grudges still find ways to cause you pain.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Of course, Da Vinci and the rest of Chaldea&#39;s staff do everything they can to care for your mental health...</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> But it&#39;s just not enough.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> And because it&#39;s not enough, an Avenger has also been secretly helping you, even as he pretends not to care.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> However, there are some things that not even he can do.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> As you&#39;ve escaped Chaldea and gone on journey after journey, you&#39;ve continued to accumulate curses slowly but surely.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Curses that will destroy a core part of you someday.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> So this time, I decided to try handling one of these...let&#39;s say karmic debts before it got too big.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Left unchecked, curses can grow into dreadful, powerful things.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> But, if I can give this one some form of direction... it might just change into something I desire.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Wait. You don&#39;t mean\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> I do. I&#39;ve always wanted to meet this other being who called himself by my name ever since I heard about him.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Now, what other name did he go by again?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Ah yes. Sorcerer.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Haha, hahaha. Hahahaha! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Foolish. Foolish! How incredibly foolish! I knew my Heroic Spirit self had been reduced to slaving for humanity...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> But I would never have dreamed he was this foolhardily ignorant!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Well now, that didn&#39;t take long at all.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> I don&#39;t suppose you could also manifest Onriedo Castle while you&#39;re at it?</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong> ...I cannot.</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong> All I can do now that I am a mere dreg of my former self is to recreate this very place.</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong> But now, to my surprise...</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong> ...that [\u2642 boy /\u2640\uFE0F girl} there has chosen to throw [\u2642 his /\u2640\uFE0F her} life away of [\u2642 his /\u2640\uFE0F her} own volition!</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong> I was prepared to spend years\u2013decades, if necessary\u2013clinging to life in the darkest recesses of [\u2642 his /\u2640\uFE0F her} brain stem, but\u2013</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Hahaha, I can&#39;t imagine that would have worked out for you.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> It would&#39;ve only been a matter of time before you were discovered and scrubbed away...</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> ...or burned to ashes by a certain someone I could name.</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong> Exactly.</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong> A tiny mouse can never hope to defeat a tiger, after all. But now, you have committed a crime of arrogance.</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong> One that resulted in giving me an opportunity with which to manifest my very self!</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong> My next step will be to destroy that [\u2642 boy&#39;s /\u2640\uFE0F girl&#39;s} mind, turn [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her} into my puppet, and then\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Um, am I in as much danger as it sounds like?</p><hr><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Don&#39;t be silly. Surely you haven&#39;t forgotten that I&#39;m here too, have you?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Everything will be fine. I promise.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> In fact...I&#39;ll even say this.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Hehe.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> According to my calculations...</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> ...I&#39;m ninety-nine point nine percent sure to win!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Wha... Are you nuts!? You just doomed us!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Oh good, you got what I meant. Excellent.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Why would you even voice that possibility!?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Hahaha, I&#39;m just kidding.</p><hr><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> I always wanted to say something like that once in my life.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> I never thought I&#39;d get the chance to actually say it loud and proud like that.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Of course, chances like that are few and far between in reality, but here...</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong> Huh?</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong> What in the world are you talking about?</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong> No, never mind that. How can you be so confident!?</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong> You think me an imposter!? Do you make light of me, as a fragment of my former self!?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Not at all.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> I&#39;m not making light of you in the slightest, nor do I think you&#39;re anything less than a formidable opponent.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> I&#39;m just fully confident that I can beat you anyway.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> To be completely honest, I wasn&#39;t sure how this would go until I came face-to-face with you.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> But now that I have, I can say this with complete certainty:</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> I will never end up like you.</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong> No. No, you absolutely won&#39;t!</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong> How could you, now that you&#39;ve thrown away your revenge, and forgotten these flames!?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> You&#39;re wrong there, Avenger.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> I&#39;ve never forgotten these flames or this hell.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> All I&#39;ve done...is make peace with them.</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong> Ridiculous!!!</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong> How can you claim with a straight face that you&#39;ve forgiven such cruelty? Such despair?</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong> Are you telling me I should just forget it ever happened? That I should wash my hands of it like so much soap!?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ve fundamentally misunderstood me, sorcerer. We may be similar, but you are definitely not me.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Just because I&#39;ve made my peace with it doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;ve forgotten it, or my hatred.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> But my hatred was only reserved for mankind&#39;s sins.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Then, we come to everything good in the world.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Until my body completely falls apart, I&#39;m going to keep searching for a way to purge evil and save all of humanity.</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong> ...You&#39;re no hero. You&#39;re not even a saint.</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong> You&#39;re just broken! A half-wit chasing delusions! There is no possible way I will fall to the likes of you!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> It seems we really are fundamentally the same at heart then, right down to the things we say.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Which means this battle will all come down to the strength of our trump cards. All right, let&#39;s get to it, shall we?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> My name is Amakusa Shirou Tokisada.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Though you may look like me, if I must destroy you in order to purify your curse...I won&#39;t hesitate to do so.</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong> Very well then! If you truly think you&#39;re capable of it, then go ahead and try!!!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong> You... You bastaaaaaard! You&#39;re nothing but a damn hypocrite pretending to be a good Samaritan!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Well, I can&#39;t say you&#39;re wrong there.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> But...it&#39;s still better than going around doing evil while not even trying to pretend otherwise, don&#39;t you think?</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong> Why!? Why don&#39;t you loathe them!? Why don&#39;t you despise them!?</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong> I have every right to hate the Tokugawa family! Shimabara was hell on earth, in every sense of the word!</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong> Ordering their starving citizens to die... Killing mothers in front of their children...</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong> The Tokugawas exploited us mercilessly for years on end! And you would have me forgive them!?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Yes, it was hell on earth. Which is why I&#39;m going to make damn sure it never happens again.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> My goal is to save all of humanity and usher in an era of permanent peace.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> I&#39;ll admit...your grudge is not without merit.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> That anger and hatred are like scars carved into my Spirit Origin. I&#39;ll never be entirely free of them.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> In that sense, the only difference between you and me is that you&#39;re still giving them voice.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> But when it comes to hurting my Master, our goals couldn&#39;t be further apart.</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong> ...I see...</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong> But...that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m about to give up!</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong> I will never lose to the likes of you! Never!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> This is as far as that spirit of yours goes, sorcerer. Come. Let&#39;s finish this.</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...In strength, skill, and striking distance, they were each practically identical. Between two such opponents, a single ordinary strike could render all their prior injuries meaningless.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Given that their fortune, compassion, and resolve were each perfectly matched...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...victory would go to the one with greater determination.</p><p><strong>Sorcerer:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> ...Phew. For all my big talk, that turned out to be disturbingly close.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So...that sorcerer was you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Was he another way you could have gone?</p><hr><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Yes, I suppose so.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> In my case, I just happened to end up with a mission to save all of humanity.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> But if I had never found that mission, and continued to nurture my hatred...I may well have ended up like him.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Or perhaps he&#39;s simply another side of me who could have been summoned under different circumstances.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> But either way, that&#39;s just an empty hypothesis now.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> For my part, I&#39;ve never forgotten that promise.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> \u201CEven if we can&#39;t understand each other, we can fight together. Even if we must someday part, we can still hold hands.\u201D</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> While I am still trying to save all of humanity, my vow to you comes first.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> You know...</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> ...that sorcerer&#39;s purity may be the same quality I just lost in myself.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Even though you&#39;re clearly having fun?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Ah, you&#39;ll have to forgive me for that.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Let&#39;s just say that in losing some things, we gain others.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> But you&#39;re okay with that, right?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Of course.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> If I wasn&#39;t, I would have left right after humanity had been restored.</p><hr><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Now then, Master, give me your hand, and let&#39;s wake up from this nightmare together.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Some time later...</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> All right, the library is nice and organized. Now I just have to go through the things from Chaldea that have been left lying around...</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong> Pardon me, Lord Amakusa.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Oh, hello, Lord Houzouin. What can I do for you?</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong> Well...</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong> ...I&#39;m just about to have a sparring session with Lord Yagyu in the combat simulator.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> I see. But I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m not sure what that has to do with me...?</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong> I&#39;m getting to that. Would you mind if I copied your catchphrase during our duel?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> My catchphrase?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> ...Oh no!</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong> I&#39;m ninety-nine point nine percent sure to win!!!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Khh...!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> H-hearing it from someone else&#39;s mouth is even more devastating than I&#39;d imagined!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Wait, hang on. How do you even know about that? On second thought, don&#39;t tell me.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> It was Master, wasn&#39;t it? Hehehe, I can&#39;t believe [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she} of all people would blab about that!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> ...On third thought, I absolutely can! Dammit! I knew I should have paid [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her} to keep [\u2642 his /\u2640\uFE0F her} mouth shut!</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong> Well...</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong> I believe all will be clear once you pay a visit to the cafeteria.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> The cafeteria!? Crap! I&#39;ll go there right now!</p><p><strong>Inshun:</strong> ...Alas, I&#39;m afraid it may already be too late.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Then he held up his sword and said this!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> \u201CI&#39;m ninety-nine point nine percent sure to win!\u201D</p><hr><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Gaaah! I&#39;m too late!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> Damn, Amakusa, that&#39;s really golden!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> I&#39;m so sorry, Amakusa.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> I confess I may have been a bit wary around you, especially since the Shimousa incident.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> I had no idea you were capable of saying something like that so earnestly. On behalf of the Fuuma clan, I apologize for my misconception. That was indeed worthy of praise.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> That&#39;s so cool! We wanna say it too!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> \u201CWe&#39;re ninety-nine point nine percent sure to win!\u201D</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong> That&#39;s so logical of you to account for the remote possibility that you might lose, Mentor!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong> I want to be ninety-nine point nine percent sure of winning too! What&#39;s the trick? Is it glasses? Do I need glasses!?</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong> I&#39;m still amazed you actually won after saying something like that.</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong> I mean, that kind of line is just begging for dramatic irony to come and smack you down!</p><p><strong>Osakabehime:</strong> Still, it&#39;s so good that I absolutely have to use it in my next book. Arigathanks for the inspiration!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> How could I let this happen!?</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Hmm, interesting. Veeery interesting.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Being cool and collected is all well and good, but in your case, you always use your smile as a mask to hide your true feelings.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> I never thought I would see you panic with such urgency. This has been most entertaining.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Not you too!</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> What is wrong with it, Amakusa Shirou?</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> \u201CI&#39;m ninety-nine point nine percent sure to win!\u201D</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Yes, I have taken a liking to it as well. I think I will continue to say it for the time being.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Please don&#39;t...</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Oh, worry not. These sorts of fads die as quickly as they begin. You need merely suffer humiliation until this one blows over.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> (Sigh)... I guess you&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> I&#39;ll just have to chalk this up as another punishment to endure.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Besides, to be honest...</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> I still can&#39;t entirely deny that catchphrase&#39;s sheer coolness.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Hm?
