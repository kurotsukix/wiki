And we&#39;d like to ask you, Mata Hari, to carry out the investigation.</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> Oh, you&#39;re wise with your decision. I&#39;ll definitely get it done.</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> But, Master. Unfortunately, I won&#39;t be able to get anywhere by myself.</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> So, please be sure to protect me, hehe.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Of course.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;ll do my best.</p><hr><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> I&#39;m counting on you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Please, we&#39;ll leave the investigation to you.</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> Right, of course. Please hold on a second.</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> ...I wonder if he&#39;ll do. Well, I&#39;ll be on my way.</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> Once I enter the tavern, please wait until evening. I&#39;m sure there&#39;ll be a raid.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Y-Yes. I got it.</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> Hello, how are you?</p><p><strong>Citizen:</strong> Huh? Oh, well...Who are you?</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> A traveling performer. You&#39;re a local, right?</p><p><strong>Citizen:</strong> Yeah, I was born and raised here.</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> Then, can you tell me about this town? I want to make a living here for a while.</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> If so, I&#39;ll have to know my way around the town, right?</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> Of course, I&#39;ll buy you a drink. That is, if you know a good place.</p><p><strong>Citizen:</strong> Oh, of course.</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> Then, let&#39;s go. Hehehe, maybe it&#39;s not healthy to drink during the day.</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> But, it&#39;s fun not being healthy. ...Wouldn&#39;t you agree?</p><p><strong>Citizen:</strong> Oh...Oh yeah, sure! Then, let&#39;s go drink!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Brilliant technique. A man perceived as single and in his early thirties instantly fell for it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Despite wearing such revealing dress, she doesn&#39;t feel unnatural at all.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> A-As expected of a legendary spy who made men of French, English, and Russian governments fall for her...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> If she wants to, she can pleasure... I mean, make the entire town fall for her.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Anyway, let&#39;s follow her and wait until nightfall.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Mata Hari is good at espionage but poor at fighting, so we have to support her.</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> Ahahaha, this is so much fun. What happened to you?</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> Still haven&#39;t had enough to drink? Or is there something else you rather do?</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> I guess it&#39;s true when men drink too much, they lose their performance.</p><p><strong>Citizen:</strong> ...Who are you? You are not just any traveling entertainer.</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> Well, who am I? That aside, can you call out the soldiers you&#39;ve been hiding?</p><p><strong>Citizen:</strong> !!!</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> Spectacular. Though I&#39;m a Servant, I&#39;m a mere Assassin, so this may be out of my control.</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> ...But. Unfortunately for you, I&#39;m not alone right now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Let&#39;s go!</p><hr><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> Yes, Master. I will give it everything since you believe in me, Mata Hari!</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> Hehehehehe. Being a Servant is fun!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> Whew. It&#39;s over. Well...Yup, that&#39;s the one right there.</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> Damn...You guys, what are you...?</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> Well now, that doesn&#39;t matter because you lost. It&#39;s fine. Everyone&#39;s alive, right?</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> Now, why don&#39;t you tell us everything. Don&#39;t miss a thing, ok?</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> Don&#39;t worry. I won&#39;t hurt you. Because I hate things that hurt.</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> Or do you like to be hurt? I can hurt you if you&#39;d like.</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> N-No... I&#39;m fine...thank you...</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> Here, you can lay on my lap. Well, go ahead\u2013tell me, everything.</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> S-Sure...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Wow, that&#39;s amazing. How do you put it... I&#39;ve witnessed the moment a man is captivated by someone.</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> What a good boy you are~ Now, tell mommy everything you know.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This is dangerous, Senpai! If this continues, we&#39;ll be crossing a line I&#39;m not sure we want to!</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> I&#39;ve got the information. Let&#39;s go see the King.</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> It seems there&#39;re golems guarding the gate, so let&#39;s all do our best there. On three!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Mata Hari. What happened to that man just now...</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> No problem. Even without me, he&#39;ll surely find someone who matches his type.</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> Hehehehehehe. What&#39;s your type, Master?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> L-Let&#39;s get going, Master! Come on!</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> Hehehehehe.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Golems sighted. I&#39;m going, Master!</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> Yes, let&#39;s do our best~</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> So, the King is the last, huh? Well, let&#39;s give him a good spanking first.</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> Then, I&#39;ll extract the information for you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But...he&#39;s the king of a country. Can you do anything?</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> What&#39;re you talking about, cute little Mash? From my experience, kings are the easiest to handle.</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> I mean, kings are at the top of their nations, right? So, they need comfort more than anyone in their nations.</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> If anyone doesn&#39;t want that, then it must be a king who sacrifices everything for his people...or for God.</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> Otherwise, he&#39;s a tyrant who understands that it&#39;s the people who make all the sacrifices.</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> If he&#39;s an ordinary king, then no problem. Well, let&#39;s fight.</p><p><strong>King:</strong> W-Who are you people!? Stand back!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No, pardon us but we&#39;d like your assistance in an investigation. We also can&#39;t deny this is rather forceful.</p><p><strong>King:</strong> You bastards...! K-Kill, I&#39;m going to kill you\u2013!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Watch out. It appears that the King is possessed by something.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I can see that!</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> Leaves us no choice, then. Let&#39;s exorcise him, Master\u266A</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>King:</strong> Uh, I...what on earth... Who are you people...?</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> Well done, Your Majesty. Hehehe, my name is Mata Hari.</p><p><strong>King:</strong> Mata Hari...? A strange...name...</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> Yes, now can you look at these eyes? My eyes are the sun.</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> A woman with eyes of the sun\u2013that is my name. Now, spill it all out.</p><p><strong>King:</strong> Oh...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Whew, looks like the investigation will be complete. Thank you, Mata Hari.</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> No problem. I&#39;m glad to have been a help to you guys, Master.</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> Well, Master. While we&#39;re at it, how about another drink before heading back?</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> Ah, no? Oh, that&#39;s too bad. Hehehehehe...</p>',96),s=[n];function i(g,h){return e(),o("div",null,s)}var l=t(r,[["render",i],["__file","Mata Hari.html.vue"]]);export{l as default};
