Can&#39;t sleep, my friend?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Leave the night watch to me. Humans require sleep. Rest up for tomorrow.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Hm? You want to hear the story of me before I became a Heroic Spirit? You are a peculiar contractor. I must ask your forgiveness.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> There are no stories of THIS me worth telling. Nor do I have any feats to boast of.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> I donned this armor to purge tyranny from the land...making me no different than those who had fallen.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> The Vlad III who was the lord of the land is no more. I stand here before you as a general, a warrior.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> The only reason why I contracted with you as a Heroic Spirit was because I sensed the presence of evil.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> You fight for justice, and the Lord allowed me to wield my lance so long as it was under your command.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> I have neither principles nor ideals. I am simply a machine, impaling your enemies. What stories could such a thing possibly have to tell?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Actually, now that I think about it, perhaps I do have a reason...</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Maybe it is just the dying flames of our fire here, but a peculiar vision comes to mind...</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Unlike the other Heroic Spirits, I&#39;ve no need for a second wish. I do not even know why I fight so fiercely after my death.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> I lost sight of God&#39;s love. I may have believed it was real, but I had forsaken the love that I actually received. Twice.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> First was the goodness of the citizens...the virtuous spirit given by the nobility. And second was my other loving half who fell from the tower...</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> I do not doubt God&#39;s love, but I never believed I would witness it ever again.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> But...I had a dream.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Hahaha. Even Servants can dream. Our dreams, though, are no more than our way of reliving what happened in our lives.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Yet mine was different. Unbelievable as it may sound, my dream was not about my past.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> It was a dream about a woman...a woman who was thinly frail, sickly at heart, who truly stood at death&#39;s door.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> The woman had lost her beloved child. Stillbirth. The experience likely shattered her heart and mind.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> In despair, she refused to eat. In a cruel twist of fate, she found she could only consume those whom she truly loved.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Of course, the woman was exiled from her homeland, a fate she accepted, becoming an outcast.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Humans who do not eat, without exception, fail to survive.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> She might have been able to convince herself that it is the natural order of things for one life to take another for sustenance.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> However, she did not once consume her loved ones, even to the day of her death.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> She chose the lives of others over her own. She managed to avoid terrorizing her loved ones until the end.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> This may sound strange to say aloud, but I believe that, through that woman, I caught just a glimpse of the love I&#39;d lost.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Just knowing such a woman exists... I would gladly burn in the fires of hell once more.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Nngh!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> What horrendous ghosts! Even after death, they attempt to murder and consume the living!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> In life, they attacked others for their own gain, and in death their loathing of the living is born of their own suffering!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Sinners who left your own prayers behind and for whom no one prays for anymore! I do not ask for your repentance! You will be no more than prey for my spear!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> That&#39;s amazing! Truly a storm of violence! Even his armor is a weapon!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> He&#39;s like a hedgehog on fire...or a spinning guillotine...or maybe a human trench mortar...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Is he like a black stain on a paint canvas?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Like a snowplow train?</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Yeah, that&#39;s it! Anyway, he&#39;s just tearing his way through enemy territory!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Doctor! Master! This really isn&#39;t the time to be making abstract metaphors about him!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Please come back, Lord Vlad! We&#39;re detecting over a hundred enemies! We need to retreat while we still have the chance!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Heh. What are you talking about, shield maiden? Do you think a mere hundred enemies is enough to stop me?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> It&#39;s only a few hundred arrows and a lance piercing my body!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Pathetic. No more than trifles. Smelling salts would sooner go to my head than these enemies!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Gu...ungh!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Lord Vlad...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Lancer...!</p><hr><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Heh. That was a good strike. Now I&#39;m awake! Time to repay you! Accept my gift from the base of your spine through the top of your head!</p><p><strong>Ghost:</strong> FiGiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii\u2014!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> What&#39;s wrong? Are the rest of these enemies cowards!? Will none of you fools challenge me one-on-one!?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Then there is nothing to do but mow this lot down. They are no more than ghosts, but they did challenge me.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> I will rip you apart until not a trace remains!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Ah, so that&#39;s Vlad \u021Aepe\u0219, the Impaler. He was an evil general, and he protected Wallachia from an army of over a million.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I never believed those stories, but now I see the evidence of it with my own eyes!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> His battlefield philosophy is brutal! There&#39;s no surviving unless you eradicate all those enemies or force them to retreat!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Obviously, we&#39;re in good hands as long as he&#39;s around!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This is no time to be impressed! Master, your orders! We will support Lord Vlad in battle!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> It&#39;s done. My friend, are you safe?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Of course.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Ah, you are so dependable! I am impressed that you are untroubled after witnessing one of my battles!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Lord Vlad, are you okay?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Of course. I cannot allow my friend to see me bleed. I must confess that last enemy did a number on me, though.</p><hr><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> But honestly, this city is quite vexing.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> I hear it was once the site of a Holy Grail War, but does the Holy Grail War really bring about so much destruction to one place?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> This sight is not of this world. Some other catastrophe must&#39;ve led to this horrific calamity.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I noticed that too. It&#39;s hard to imagine even a Holy Grail going out of control could cause all this.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Well, the Greater Grail in Fuyuki was a ginormous Magical Reactor Core, so it&#39;s at least possible it could blow the whole city up.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> But for it to keep burning like this... It doesn&#39;t make sense.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Are there other things we don&#39;t know? Did you come with us because there&#39;s something you sensed, Lord Vlad?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> It wasn&#39;t for the expedition, as I&#39;ve no experience or knowledge in such things. It&#39;s just that I do not care for the particular contamination in this Singularity.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> There&#39;s something here. Something I loathe above all else. I&#39;d hoped to find its source and destroy it...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Sorry. You&#39;re out of time. The Holy Grail has already been recovered from that Singularity.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> You can&#39;t stay there long, I&#39;m afraid. The surplus magical energy sent to Sheba is about to run out.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;m sure this expedition leaves you unsatisfied, Lord Vlad, but can we have you all return right now?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Ah, no need to fret, Romantic Man.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Your spineless personality is deplorable, but your daily hard work and attention to detail are to be commended at least.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Ah, would that all humans were so diligent as you. Such could never be, sadly.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Welcome back, Fujimaru. Where&#39;s Lord Vlad? Ah...he&#39;s back in standby mode.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> But I never imagined a Servant like him would point out the problem of Fuyuki.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Looking back into Fuyuki is on our to-do list, but the next Singularity takes priority.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> After all, we are approaching the Seventh Singularity in Uruk, during the Age of Gods. Everyone will have to work their butts off, or we won&#39;t make it...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Oh? Is something on your mind, Fujimaru? If I can be of help, I&#39;m more than happy to lend an ear.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...I just don&#39;t understand why Lord Vlad fights...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I heard this story, once...</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...Hm. A Servant&#39;s dream...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> You may be talking about the battle records that get engraved into their soul after they become Heroic Spirits.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> But I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a sad story. He said \u201CI would gladly burn in the fires of hell\u201D...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> He doesn&#39;t mean he wants to suffer again. I think he means he&#39;s just looking for some hope.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Even if she had to do it for her survival, the woman in his story never chose to take the life of another.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It wasn&#39;t for her dignity or for her humanity...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Basically... One doesn&#39;t sacrifice the lives of others for their own protection or gain.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Obvious human kindness...the way a soul should be...was something he believed in. That goes for both past and present.</p>',106),s=[a];function i(h,l){return o(),t("div",null,s)}var g=e(n,[["render",i],["__file","Vlad III - EXTRA.html.vue"]]);export{g as default};
