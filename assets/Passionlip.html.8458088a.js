Contains elements from Parvati, Durga, and Brynhildr.</p><p><strong>Magic Resistance C:</strong> Cancels spells with a chant below two verses. Can\u2019t defend against large scale magecraft like High-Thaumaturgy or Greater Rituals.</p><p><strong>Independent Action C:</strong> Ability to act independently for a period even if mana supply from the Master is severed. Alter Egos which exist as \u300Eanother aspect of a certain existence\u300Fcan work independently without a Master, but since Lip is bad at economizing her fuel the rank has lowered.</p><p><strong>Presence Concealment A+:</strong> A skill to act while hiding one\u2019s form. A skill that the Assassin class has as a basic ability. Lip displays an excellent Presence Concealment from her cowardice and prudence, but her huge claws get in the way and make her be found out immediately. Were it not because of her claws she\u2019d be an outstanding stalker.</p><h2 id="personal-skills" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#personal-skills" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Personal Skills</h2><p><strong>Breast Valley A:</strong> Function for temporarily storing and archiving unnecessary data files. Same as a trash can. In Passionlip\u2019s case, that icon is set for some reason at the center of her chest. To put it briefly, it\u2019s a pocket of imaginary numbers where you can accumulate all the trash you want. If it\u2019s dust data crushed by Passionlip, they can be infinitely stored no matter the capacity. It seems that even those exceeding Lip\u2019s own memory can be dumped into this valley. Although it looks like a convenient function at first glance, since the dust data won\u2019t return to their original form, it\u2019s a completely meaningless function. Passionlip is thought to have gained this particular structure because she\u2019s a self-destructive/self-harming type of girl that keeps her feelings inside. In \u300ECCC\u300F, once something fell in this valley of death it wouldn\u2019t crawl up again, but in \u300EFGO\u300Fshe became able to scoop up the contracted Master.</p><p><strong>Masochistic Constitution A:</strong> Passionlip\u2019s id_es skill. In a collective battle, gathers the hostility (hate) of the enemy towards oneself, and increases the probability of being targeted by attacks. Although it may be seen as a disadvantage, this skill makes those with a strong defensive power that have it function as excellent escort guards. Besides including a slight bonus to defense, an additional special effect comes at A rank, the attackers lose their calm as they attack, and in the end they will only be able to think about the one with this skill. A skill that leads to death in one-versus-one, but a very useful skill in battles with a party.</p><p><strong>Trash &amp; Crash EX:</strong> Called an id_es skill, one of the particular skills possessed by the Alter Ego \xB7 Sakura Series derived from BB. A cheat skill evolved from \u300EMonstrous Strength\u300F. No matter how huge the capacity may be, as long as it is \u201Csomething that can be wrapped with the hands\u201D, it\u2019ll be crushed and compressed by those claws. Although what has been compressed becomes a 1 cm square cube, its mass can only be reduced to one tenth of what it was before the compression. Compressed things are later treated as dust data. What can be compressed are only things smaller than Lip\u2019s hands\u2015 No, \u201Cwhat fits in the hand\u201D from her point of view is treated as a target. It\u2019s planar physical interference that ignores perspective, but as expected it takes time to compress large things. A cheat-like pictorial compression technique (codec) unique to a digital space. Lip is specialized in destruction, and if the target is stationary\u2026\u2026 terrain or a building, she displays destructive power superior to BB. Although, if the opponent is a Servant or a Master, escaping from the quick-to-sense-danger Lip\u2019s vision \u2192 the dull Lip not chasing them is the outcome.</p><h2 id="noble-phantasm-s" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#noble-phantasm-s" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Noble Phantasm(s)</h2><h1 id="brynhildr-romantia-even-if-death-does-us-apart" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#brynhildr-romantia-even-if-death-does-us-apart" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Brynhildr Romantia: Even if Death does us apart</h1><ul><li>Rank: C</li><li>Type: Anti-Mind Noble Phantasm</li><li>Range: 2~10</li><li>Maximum number of targets: 1 person</li></ul><p>Brynhildr Romantia. An Anti-Mind Noble Phantasm given to Alter Ego by BB. Since the Noble Phantasms of the Alter Egos are illegal reconstructions of regular Noble Phantasms, the Servant used as a material is the Walk\xFCre Brynhildr from the \u300EVolsunga Saga\u300F. A spear of hate and love wielded for revenge against her husband Sigur\xF0r, who betrayed her and wounded her honor. Passionlip\u2019s Noble Phantasm\u2019s property too\u2026\u2026 The more intense the love towards the opponent, the more intensely powerful\u2026\u2026 That\u2019s what it had, but that\u2019s a story of the past. The heart that ounce shouted called \u300EUntil Death does us apart\u300F, now has changed to hope for \u300EEven if Death does us apart\u300F. Farewell will surely come. Whether that is a catastrophe or a treason, love itself can\u2019t be denied. \u300ENo matter the farewell, since the love until then was true, I\u2019ll believe it\u2019s eternal\u300F As Lip wished, it became power not to hate the loved one, but to protect the loved one. Truly pure innocence and mature saint girl power. After dealing great damage to the enemy party, it restores the energy of the ally party.</p><h1 id="character" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#character" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Character</h1><h2 id="pronouns" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pronouns" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Pronouns</h2><ul><li>First person pronoun: \u308F\u305F\u3057 (watashi)</li><li>Second person pronoun: \u30A2\u30CA\u30BF (anata)</li><li>Third person pronoun: \u3042\u306E\u4EBA (ano hito) / \u307F\u306A\u3055\u3093 (mina-san) Towards the Master: \u30DE\u30B9\u30BF\u30FC\u3055\u3093 (Master-san) / \u30DE\u30B9\u30BF\u30FC (Master) / \u3007\u3007\u3055\u3093 (attach -san to name).</li></ul><p>If it\u2019s the female main character, when she wants to get along with her as a fellow girl and musters courage: \u3007\u3007\u3061\u3083\u3093 (attach -chan to name).</p><h2 id="personality" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#personality" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Personality</h2><p>An intense personality regularly misinterpreted as introverted. If something goes wrong, she has the habit of blaming others (surroundings) and withdrawing in her shell. In \u300ECCC\u300Fthat disposition\u2026\u2026 Regularly, she can\u2019t approach the opponent\u2026\u2026 But although she showed herself as a stalker, after recognizing her own mistakes/faults, she refrained her disposition as a stalker, and started to aim to \u201Cwork properly, get along properly\u201D. But her laziness (if there\u2019s a reason she\u2019ll skip work) hasn\u2019t changed, she herself is aware of that bad part, and tries to fix that. As a result, the current Passionlip positively tries to fix \u201Cmy bad parts\u201D every day, and has become a hard-worker girl.</p><p>In contrast with Meltlilith who was \u300Ea girl that loves love\u300F, Passionlip was \u300Ea girl that seeks love\u300F. But since she won\u2019t be loved for her outer appearance, since nothing will be obtained from that love even while seeking it, that love turned into hatred. The Alter Ego of love and hatred, that\u2019s what Passionlip was born as, but there isn\u2019t even the shade of it in the current Lip. Since she originally had an honest personality, her personality has become a bit like the one of the girl that \u300Ebecame the base for BB\u300F.</p><h2 id="attitude-towards-master" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attitude-towards-master" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Attitude Towards Master</h2><p>She is self-conscious about what a Servant with an atrocious and troubling ability she is. For that reason, she is thankful to the Master who doesn\u2019t abandon her and accompanies her. That thankfulness will gradually change into deep affection and longing, and in the end she\u2019ll dream of love. \u2026\u2026 However, Lip, who is self-conscious of her biography and specialty, can\u2019t \u300Eseek love innocently\u300F. If she\u2019s infatuated, if she can be loved, she\u2019ll hurt that gentle person. That\u2019s why while she keeps dreaming like this, she strives to become the Master\u2019s power from the shadows.</p><h2 id="dialogue-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dialogue-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dialogue Examples</h2><ul><li>\u300C\u2026\u2026I\u2019m, the Alter Ego of love and hate, Passionlip\u2026\u2026 Er\u2026\u2026 If I hurt you, I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u2026\u300D</li><li>\u300CIt\u2019s a luxurious plate, but my hands are a bit\u2026\u2026 Eh?

Because she\u2019s not a \u300Ecopy of the personality\u300F but \u300Esomething made based on the personality\u300F, she didn\u2019t become an avatar but an alter ego (another personality). The Alter Ego of love and hate. An impressive girl with a chest too big and ferocious claws. She doesn\u2019t like fighting, but since her skill Masochistic Constitution makes her be attacked by her surroundings, she reluctantly counter-attacks. The best power character from among the Alter Egos. A monopolizing, blind incarnation of sought love that embraces her opponent, twists them off, and keeps them in her chest\u2026\u2026 That\u2019s what she was, but after being corrected in a certain encounter that unilateral sought love isn\u2019t good, she\u2019s careful not to harm the surroundings with the numerous lethal weapons of her body, and has become a shy yet gentle AI.</p><p>The bodies of three goddesses have been incorporated in Passionlip. The first goddess is the goddess of beauty in India, Parvati. The goddess that loved the god of destruction Shiva blindly and dedicatedly. The second goddess is the goddess of war, Durga. The aspect of Parvati, Durga, possesses ten divine weapons. Passionlip\u2019s huge claws embody those ten swords. The third goddess is the Nordic goddess of war, Brynhildr. A queen that, unable to be united with the hero she fell in love with, brought ruin out of sorrow. Regarded as Br\xFCnnhilde in Wagner\u2019s opera, and synonymously in the description of some old Edda, she appears as a warrior maiden that sends the souls of the dead to heaven. Not to mention, the circumstances here turned love into despair too, a tragedy in which a loved one was killed with those hands.</p><h2 id="perceptive-disorder" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#perceptive-disorder" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Perceptive disorder:</h2><p>Many people can\u2019t look at themselves objectively. It can happen not only mentally, but physically. Humans can\u2019t look at themselves. No, to be correct, the impartiality to look directly at \u201Cmy appearance without falsehoods\u201D is scarce. Since humans have wisdom, only convenient information from the reality in front of their eyes becomes truth. It\u2019s not like selection of information, but a hoax of information, that sometimes happens unconsciously to the point of modification. Passionlip\u2019s perceptive disorder was the most extreme. She can\u2019t recognize the shape of her own two hands. Her \u201Cbrain\u201D made her eyes to avert her hideous form, an exaggerated inter-cerebral conversion of her arms as those of a normal girl. She only saw her claws as \u300Esomething normal\u300F. For this reason, Lip couldn\u2019t understand the reason of \u201Cwhy are they scared of me?\u201D. Not understanding that her body is ugly as a reason, when she was pointed out that she only tilted her head: \u300EWhy do you say such a lie?\u300F \u300EDo you want to bully me to the point of lying?\u300F Yes, she could only hate her surroundings. However, her current self is confronting her body properly and accepting her monstrosity. Regarding her huge nails and perceptive disorder, Passionlip is a complete victim. Because even though her perceptive disorder was born from escape, there are no deceptions or lies in her heart.</p><h2 id="related-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#related-characters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Related Characters</h2><p><strong>BB</strong> Selfish, conceited, sly, scary, mean, she was a person I couldn\u2019t see but\u2026\u2026 I\u2019ve lost just a bit of that dislike recently. But since facing being a mother (original) is troubling, if there were reasons and chances\u2026\u2026 N-no, it\u2019s nothing!</p><p><strong>Meltlilith</strong> The closest one to BB from among the Alter Egos, an Alter Ego that isn\u2019t recommended to others. Although she\u2019s a mass of desire to control (pride) that gets excited when hurting her surroundings, I seriously think she\u2019s more elegant than BB. Also, the part of swaggering about \u300EI\u2019m the older sister\u300F despite her manufacturing date being the same as mine is very childish, right?</p><p><strong>Sessh\u014Din Kiara</strong> I don\u2019t understand it really well, but I feel she\u2019s similar to Melt. Melt is much prettier, though.</p><p><strong>Gawain</strong> He\u2019s a very reliable knight! A prince with a white horse\u2026\u2026 He\u2019s a bit different than that, a prince that grows like that, has rather become an adult that knows his position as a feudal lord\u2026\u2026 Anyways, although I don\u2019t like him I think he\u2019s a wonderful person!</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat</strong> My first friend. It seems she\u2019s an Alter Ego different from the Sakura Five. Being together is fun, calms me down, and makes me happy. She\u2019s also very good at cooking!
