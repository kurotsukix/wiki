I just heard a loud sound!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Buenos d\xEDas, Mash! \xBFQue pas\xF3? You look so frightened, yes!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um...nothing... I should actually be asking you that...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Wait a minute! Senpai and Quetzalcoatl are entangled in a very questionable position!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Quetzalcoatl&#39;s legs are wrapped around Senpai&#39;s head... Wh-what is going on!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What do you mean?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You see...</p><hr><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> This is a lesson, yes!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> This is called an Huracarrana! It is a move where a wrestler cradles the opponent&#39;s head with their thighs and flips around using their momentum...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> The goal is to slam the opponent to the mat to get a fall. It&#39;s a very popular lucha libre move, yes!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> And there you have it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Yep...help!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I see. I think I understand the situation now! But please stop, Quetzalcoatl!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Should you actually use that move on Senpai, [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she} will be seeing stars for the rest of the day!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> No problema! I&#39;ve taught Fujimaru the basics of breaking a fall!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> [\u2642 He /\u2640\uFE0F She} is likely to bounce off the ring after hitting the mat, but it should be okay as long as [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she} grabs the rope at the right moment!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Hahaha, that&#39;s impossible, no!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;m about to lose consciousness already, yes!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, please stop, Quetzalcoatl! Senpai seems to be trying to talk!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> ...I didn&#39;t realize. Lo siento, Master...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> When I heard that preparations for battle were complete, I thought that meant it was time for a match! Soy una mala diosa...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Another second and I&#39;d have fallen into Kur!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I wasn&#39;t as careful with my words as I should have been...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Quetzalcoatl looks a bit down...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You just told her the simulator was ready, right, Senpai?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But didn&#39;t you have a match recently, Quetzalcoatl?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I thought you said seeing Medb&#39;s flying kicks made you want to face off with a striker...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> She has some nice moves, but the moment it turns into close combat, is not so flashy, no...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> It&#39;s basically judo. Once you get caught in a grapple, you can&#39;t get away...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> ...But she&#39;s not so strong, so I can just toss her around after I slip her hold without even trying...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> And that&#39;s no fun...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> I want an aerial throw that sends someone flying, yes! I want lucha that excites an audience! \xA1Muy emocionante!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> (Sigh)... I want to fight more! I want to use my wrestling moves on others, and to have them use wrestling moves on me, yes!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I understand. But I&#39;d rather you not crush Senpai&#39;s spine or ribs...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Of course not. I will handle Master as gently as an egg! I haven&#39;t hurt you yet, have I?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;re right...it doesn&#39;t hurt that much!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Wait... What do you mean \u201Cyet\u201D?</p><hr><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Eh...? Did it hurt? Lo siento... Maybe I overdid it...yes...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Quetzalcoatl, I think you need to get a better feel for your own strength.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You are definitely more intellectual and dependable than the other goddess Servants...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But you also seem to be a lot more...human...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> \xA1Ah, entendida!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Teehee, naughty Mash. You don&#39;t like that I&#39;m taking up so much of Master&#39;s time!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Then let&#39;s practice lucha moves on Master together! \xA1Ser\xE1 divertido!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I-I... That&#39;s not what I meant! But...let&#39;s stop doing wrestling moves on Senpai entirely...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But now that you mention it, I have an idea. Give me some time to prepare. Please stay there...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Actually, please keep your distance from Master! I&#39;ve rung the bell! The match is over! Do you hear it!?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> \xA1Que linda! She&#39;s in such a hurry for me! Mash is always so energetic!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> I do not know what she is going to do, no, but I bet it is safe to say I should look forward to it, s\xED, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yep. That&#39;s what makes Mash great.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Yes, yes! She puts so much effort into things she does for other people, rather than her own desires. That is the mark of a great person!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Sometimes it may be in vain, and it may even be a weakness occasionally, but that is exactly the sort of thing we have been hoping for all this time.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You&#39;re cute too, Quetz.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Th-that is a sudden change of subject! You&#39;re making big sister blush, yes!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> I&#39;m used to being called beautiful, but cute... Well, that tickles me a little!</p><hr><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> So, this is where Mash wanted us to go. Let&#39;s see what she has planned.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> So my opponent has finally come. I&#39;d say she&#39;s in the heavyweight class, perhaps?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Eh? What&#39;s going on?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I asked for her help.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Since Quetzalcoatl is so frustrated, I arranged for her to fight three martial artists here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It will be a mixed martial arts match, and while I couldn&#39;t prepare a proper ring...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I&#39;m sure these matches will satisfy her.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> As presumptuous as it is, I, Mash Kyrielight, shall be the referee for the matches.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> I see. So Se\xF1orita Martha is going to be my first opponent.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> I can see that her Spirit Origin is sturdy like iron, yes! I won&#39;t need to hold back at all! And a saintly wrestler is such a great personaje!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I am honored to hear that you consider me a formidable opponent.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I may possess the great Jacob&#39;s fists, but there is definitely still room for me to grow.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I&#39;d like to see how my fists match up against the great Mayan goddess in this match.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Oooh, she is up to the challenge, yes... Are you perhaps a ruda, Martha...?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Well, everything is fine as long as we have fun, yes? I am confident I can take a hit myself!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Please don&#39;t hold back, Martha. Let us both go all-out.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> By the way, I will serve as commentator.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Whose moves will reign supreme...? Will it be fists or twists? These questions have always intrigued me, and have been my life&#39;s pursuit for so long now.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Oh, the professor who&#39;s been holed up in the warehouse, yes? A commentator! Mash thought of everything!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> But I&#39;m sorry...I&#39;ve sealed away my llave moves. After all, jumping moves are what makes Lucha Libre so great.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> ...Are you saying you&#39;re not even going to use your signature move? You&#39;re not taking me very seriously, are you?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Fine. I won\u2019t hold back! I&#39;ll even use my Tarasque. And if I throw you out, I can use weapons, right?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I&#39;m still quite new as far as learning all the other Servants&#39; quirks, but is Miss Martha always like this?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> For a Ruler, she doesn&#39;t seem to be all that concerned with the rules.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> No, no, ringside battles are a highlight of lucha! I knew Martha was a ruda!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> But don&#39;t you worry, Master.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> I may not have a shell, but I have wings. No matter who my com\xFAn is, I won&#39;t go down easy, no!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> This has turned into quite the intense brawl. Miss Martha seems to have landed more punches.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> And they are no mere jabs. Any ordinary Servant would have gone down in short order.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> One might say that while she has a rather slender Spirit Origin, she hides the power of a freight train in those arms of hers.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> And what stamina! Even the rhythm of her breathing sounds like the roaring of a dynamo!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> But Quetzalcoatl isn&#39;t backing down either.</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Right you are. Ah, take a look. Miss Martha is finally getting in position.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> All that pounding and I still haven&#39;t been able to bring this to an end. Time to use my trump card!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> That stance... She&#39;s readying the fist of justice, inverted thrust...Jacob&#39;s Perishing Fist.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Jacob&#39;s Perishing Fist!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What are you talking about, Holmes!?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Quiet. The real battle starts now. It would be a shame to miss even a single second!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> The Jacob&#39;s Limbs style is said to be able to defeat even an archangel. It&#39;s specialized for use against a target with Divinity...like Quetzalcoatl.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> And behold that stance, Fujimaru. She&#39;s putting everything into that strike, and so leaving herself wide open!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Should it hit head-on, there will be consequences. For both parties, that is.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> My stomach&#39;s going to be wide-open for you. In exchange\u2013</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I&#39;m going to shoot that jaw of yours all the way to Marseille!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> \xA1Ol\xE9! I&#39;ve been waiting for that one hit!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> ...What!? It&#39;s not...working!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Um...she took it straight on the chin...</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> It&#39;s an evasive maneuver. The instant that fist touches her face, she turns her head to avoid injury.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Of course, it&#39;s easier said than done, and it&#39;s not something just anyone can do. But, she&#39;s managed to pull of that miraculous feat!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> I will not knee your stomach, no! Rather, I&#39;m going to take this extended arm of yours, yes!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> What a perfect armlock. That should determine our victor here!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Why...you... Let go...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Tres! Dos! Uno! Ding ding ding! And the winner is: Quetzalcoatl!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> O Jacob, O Moses...I&#39;m terribly sorry. I have suffered utter defeat...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Martha, you were a wonderful opponent. Especially that last pu\xF1etazo...I thought I was going to pass out.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> I&#39;m sure you wouldn&#39;t have stopped even if I kicked your stomach.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> You forced me to use the llave that I had originally sealed off.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I never imagined you wouldn&#39;t try to evade my fist. I&#39;m not making excuses for myself, but I flinched a little.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> And that was the reason for your defeat! A luchadora does not even think of evading!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> A lucha match is all about lifting the opponent up. That&#39;s why I took your hit. You just didn&#39;t know that.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> If you had known, you would have continued into a clinch hold, yes?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Had that happened, I don&#39;t know how the match would have gone.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> ...I see. Way to go. You completely defeated me.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> We may be from different worlds, but it&#39;s clear to me that you are a divine spirit of good. I&#39;ve not a single ounce of resentment towards you.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Let&#39;s fight in a proper ring next time. I shall study up on lucha a bit more until then.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> \xA1De nada! I shall look forward to that time, yes!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Miss Quetzalcoatl took the first round. But will she be able to pull it off with her next opponent?</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong> It looks like it&#39;s my turn. Woo, woo!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Whoa, it&#39;s an all-black monster, yes! What happened? Did you stay out in the sun too long and get burnt?</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong> Yeah, well, I&#39;ve got my reasons. I&#39;m really not supposed to reveal my True Name all willy-nilly.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong> Think of me as...uh, the man of two thousand faces or somethin&#39;... How &#39;bout you just call me Dos Mil M\xE1scaras?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Um, you&#39;ve got a bunch of things all jumbled up!</p><p><strong>Dos Mil M\xE1scaras:</strong> Course I do. I&#39;m that kinda guy. I&#39;ve even lost count of how many faces I have.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> So, from the name, shouldn&#39;t you be wearing a mask or something?</p><p><strong>Dos Mil M\xE1scaras:</strong> Oh, I&#39;m wearing a mask. You just can&#39;t see it because I&#39;m silhouetted. You just don&#39;t get it, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I figured he would be able to hold his ground even against Quetzalcoatl&#39;s aerial killer move.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> And if we are to follow the tradition of Lucha Libre, we definitely need a rudo.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> I&#39;d actually expected Jaguar to show up as our ruda...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> But fine! Let&#39;s do this! That move you just showed, Se\xF1or Dos Mil M\xE1scaras...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> I have a feeling I&#39;m going to enjoy a stimulating aerial battle against you!</p><p><strong>Dos Mil M\xE1scaras:</strong> Well, this is what I was hired to do, so I won&#39;t disappoint!</p><p><strong>Dos Mil M\xE1scaras:</strong> But are you really okay with this? Shouldn&#39;t I be the worst sort of opponent for you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Maybe in terms of class affinity!</p><hr><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Yes. But what about it?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Even if she&#39;s injured, a luchadora must project grace and power before her fans, yes!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> I won&#39;t go down easy, no matter what class you are! I&#39;ll prove that right now!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> And know that a luchadora is at her most terrifying on the brink of being knocked down!</p><p><strong>Dos Mil M\xE1scaras:</strong> Hah! Loving that confidence! Then I&#39;ll kick your ass, as requested!</p><p><strong>Dos Mil M\xE1scaras:</strong> Will you be able to keep up with my awesome moves?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Hm. This has turned into quite the aerial battle, but it appears Dos Mil M\xE1scaras has the upper hand.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Are Quetzalcoatl&#39;s moves not working?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Her moves are pretty flashy and nothing else. An expert martial artist like Dos Mil M\xE1scaras can evade her easily.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> On the other hand, he&#39;s definitely hurting Miss Quetzalcoatl with his moves.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Seems he has studied Baritsu. His moves are nimble, and he&#39;s definitely hitting the vital spots.</p><p><strong>Dos Mil M\xE1scaras:</strong> (Hey, hey, hey...I&#39;m hitting all the right spots! So why isn&#39;t this lady going down!?)</p><p><strong>Dos Mil M\xE1scaras:</strong> (Actually, that last move definitely hit her! But she just gets back up. But what&#39;s more important...)</p><p><strong>Dos Mil M\xE1scaras:</strong> (That&#39;s insane! Totally insane! The way the air bounces back up is surreal! Is she the Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King or what!?)</p><p><strong>Dos Mil M\xE1scaras:</strong> (She&#39;s like a giant mountain! If that muscle monster gets her hands on me, she&#39;ll crush my very soul to pieces, to say nothing of my Spirit Origin!)</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> You&#39;re looking nervous, M\xE1scara. I&#39;ll take this opportunity to answer your question.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Your attacks are effective, efficient, and very painful, yes! But the pain is still tolerable.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Why? Because...!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> The limpio would never let the rudo&#39;s attacks defeat them, no! Instead, the more I get hit, the more fired up I get, yes!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> So brace yourself, yes! I&#39;m going to use my ultimate attack: my Xiuhcoatl Driver\u2013</p><p><strong>Dos Mil M\xE1scaras:</strong> Uh, I&#39;d rather you not do that. I give up! I give up!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Does that mean you&#39;re throwing in the towel?</p><p><strong>Dos Mil M\xE1scaras:</strong> Yep. This is not worth getting turned into a greasy smear on the floor.</p><p><strong>Dos Mil M\xE1scaras:</strong> I kinda half-assed taking this job. If it was a life-and-death sort of fight, I&#39;d have asked for a lot more money to do it.</p><p><strong>Dos Mil M\xE1scaras:</strong> So, you win, since you took everything I had without going down. You good with that, Miss Lucha?</p><p><strong>Dos Mil M\xE1scaras:</strong> If the opponent admits defeat, that&#39;s the end of the match. Isn&#39;t that the best bit of pro wrestling?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> That is correct, yes! I feel like you and I will get along fine, yes!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> ...So I am a little disappointed. If we ever get to meet again, I&#39;d like to see the face behind your mask!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Because if you stick to being shy, you might just lose your heart. \xBFEntendido?</p><p><strong>Dos Mil M\xE1scaras:</strong> Ha. Thanks for that warning. I&#39;d...uh...rather not ever meet you again...</p><p><strong>Dos Mil M\xE1scaras:</strong> But the world of lucha libre is pretty deep. Maybe it&#39;s time I took an interest in a different martial art...</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Whew. Both rounds were fun, yes!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> An orthodox fighter and a flying rudo. I very much enjoyed it. So who is my final opponent?</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong> Sorry to make you wait. Your final opponent will be me, Mask de Baritsu.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;ve never seen that Heroic Spirit...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Okay, just how much is that mask getting passed around?</p><hr><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Ah, a masked wrestler is also one of the highlights of Lucha Libre! He will be quite a formidable end to this three-round match, yes!</p><p><strong>Mask de Baritsu:</strong> My observations are complete. I can see that your body is positively riddled with wounds from the previous matches, and that you are running low on stamina.</p><p><strong>Mask de Baritsu:</strong> While I am a gentleman who prefers to play fair, I am not always able to do so. I only engage in battle when I have a significant advantage over my opponent.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Well, THAT is a terrible thing to say...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Impressive, Baritsu Mask. That&#39;s smart.</p><hr><p><strong>Mask de Baritsu:</strong> Indeed. By the way, my Baritsu is a well-rounded mix of strikes, throws, and holds. It&#39;s the ultimate self-defense martial art.</p><p><strong>Mask de Baritsu:</strong> You have no chance of winning. Would you like to withdraw?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Your concern is unnecessary, Baritsu Mask.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Fatigue and injury are everyday things for a luchadora! And actually, I&#39;m in top condition right now, yes!</p><p><strong>Mask de Baritsu:</strong> I was hoping for that response. Then let us begin our match, Miss Quetzalcoatl.</p><p><strong>Mask de Baritsu:</strong> But...why are you and Master not calling me by my proper nom de guerre?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> You&#39;re open, Baritsu!</p><p><strong>Mask de Baritsu:</strong> Heh...do you really think so? (And why is she STILL not using my nom de guerre?)</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Guh...</p><p><strong>Mask de Baritsu:</strong> I have targeted your arm now. Time to surrender. I regret to inform you that victory is now quite beyond your reach as matters stand.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> ...Do you know why there are so many flashy moves in Lucha Libre?</p><p><strong>Mask de Baritsu:</strong> No...I cannot say I have given it any thought. They are likely just inefficient skills meant for nothing so much as pure showmanship.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> No! They are for the audience, and for your opponent, with whom you share a deep mutual trust!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> If you are seeking efficiency in battle, then you should head to war!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> A battle without cheers or lights...a battlefield that is utterly lonely!</p><p><strong>Mask de Baritsu:</strong> Cheers? Do those really matter for battle?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Of course! That&#39;s why, Master, I ask you to cheer for me!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> \xA1Ol\xE9! Go, lucha master!</p><hr><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Mucho mucho! That has given me the strength of a hundred luchadoras! Hiyaaah!</p><p><strong>Mask de Baritsu:</strong> (She jumped straight up to break my joint lock... What incredible pain tolerance. Or rather, is this the vaunted endurance that every wrestler possesses?)</p><p><strong>Mask de Baritsu:</strong> This is no time to admire her moves! Ugh, I can&#39;t keep my balance! Or my mask!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Sorry. Any m\xE1scara that falls off so easily is no match for me!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> If you are a true wrestler, you need to be more fashion-conscious! And here we go...! La M\xEDstica!!!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AMask de Baritsu:</strong> (What is this move...!? What is going on!?)</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AMask de Baritsu:</strong> (Spinning...am I spinning? Really? How are we spinning THIS much!?)</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AMask de Baritsu:</strong> (After six full spins, the inner ear simply goes haywire, and it becomes impossible to take an attack. And yet...we&#39;re still spinning?)</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AMask de Baritsu:</strong> (Are we in...space? I can see space...I don&#39;t recall...taking my medicines...this morning...)</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AMask de Baritsu:</strong> (There&#39;s no need for careful examination to know what&#39;s happening here! I&#39;m doomed!)</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AMask de Baritsu:</strong> (Tap, tap)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Holmes has tapped out! Quetzalcoatl, please cancel your drop!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Quetzalcoatl is the winner!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Aw. Then there won&#39;t be a head-first drop, no...</p><p><strong>Mask de Baritsu:</strong> ...Whew. Cervical spine annihilation avoided.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Yes. You were spared because you tapped so early.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> You should be grateful that I am so precise in executing my moves, yes. For any other wrestler, we were beyond the point of no return!</p><p><strong>Mask de Baritsu:</strong> Probably. I&#39;m surprised I lived. I&#39;m actually more frightened that you have the muscles to stop that move than the muscles needed to do it in the first place.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Of course. I told you. Luchadoras perform their moves with utmost consideration for their partners!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Stopping a move midway through is just common courtesy. But I suspect you could have fought more!</p><p><strong>Mask de Baritsu:</strong> I had every intention of doing so. The spirit is willing, but the body...not so much.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What do you mean?</p><hr><p><strong>Mask de Baritsu:</strong> The move was surreal. It was so intense, but at the same time, my heart was pounding with excitement.</p><p><strong>Mask de Baritsu:</strong> Excited that the move was terrible...and intriguing at the same time. The moment I had that thought, my body tapped out quite of its own accord.</p><p><strong>Mask de Baritsu:</strong> I have the confidence to meet any malevolent attack directly, but it appears my self-defense skills cannot handle moves made with kind intentions.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Heehee. You speak too highly of it. I just didn&#39;t have the strength to make it hurt.</p><p><strong>Mask de Baritsu:</strong> I withdraw what I said about your moves being just for show. It reminds me of a Japanese sword form called kassatsuken, where one imbues their sword with life and death for their battle.</p><p><strong>Mask de Baritsu:</strong> One permits their opponent to live, even after defeating them. I had always found this contradictory, but...I understand now.</p><p><strong>Mask de Baritsu:</strong> Strength is not simply a matter of defeating your opponent.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Yes, your moves were also very strong, Baritsu Mask. But you seem to be very fragile. You need to eat better so your bones will be sturdy, yes!</p><p><strong>Mask de Baritsu:</strong> I&#39;ll take your word for it.</p><p><strong>Mask de Baritsu:</strong> ...Your technique is a sort I would never employ, but I would still like to show my respect to you, who has so mastered lucha.</p><p><strong>Mask de Baritsu:</strong> Adi\xF3s, Miss Quetzalcoatl. Should we have the opportunity, I would like to meet again.</p><p><strong>Mask de Baritsu:</strong> But...why will no one properly use my nom de guerre?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Whew.
