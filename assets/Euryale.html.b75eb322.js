We&#39;ve been here\u2013</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> Hehehehe\u266A Yes, I see. So this is the place!</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> It&#39;s kind of strange, this feeling I have. But, part of me seems to be accepting it.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> Yes, I see! In this place, something like this could happen.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> This is where &quot;I&quot; was. Hehe\u266A</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yes, my Goddess.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> That&#39;s right. &quot;The Shaped Isle,&quot; I think she called it. We stopped by during our search for the Second Singularity.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> She\u2013no, I mean &quot;you,&quot; or maybe it&#39;s better to say &quot;all of you?&quot;</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Either way, the landscape seems to differ from the island you and the rest of the Gorgon Sisters, used to live on.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> Yes, it&#39;s very different. This is nothing like it.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> But they do have the sea in common. Yes, &quot;I&quot; was at the sea, was &quot;I&quot; not?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yes, my Goddess.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Senpai?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou?</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> Hmm? What is it? Oh, right. You have my thanks, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> Bringing me to the place where &quot;I&quot; was has made me very happy. I mean it.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> So I&#39;ll give you a reward. You see the cave entrance by those rocks\u2013?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fou...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s the cave Stheno told us to go into. Dangerous monsters lived, no, were placed there.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The Second Singularity, 1st century Rome, is already repairing itself, but it might still be dangerous.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> That phantasmal might still be there. It&#39;s better to stay away.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> Hmm? What is it? I can&#39;t hear you.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Huh?</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> I&#39;m curious to see what kind of trial &quot;I&quot; gave you.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> So... Please, Fujimaru\u266A</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um, that&#39;s\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yes, my Goddess.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> S-Senpai? What&#39;s gotten into you? You&#39;re acting strange.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fooooou...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> From the look of it, she&#39;s using some kind of Divine Authority?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But if she&#39;s using something of that nature, I think I&#39;d be able to detect the magical energy...</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> You&#39;re silly, Mash. I am a goddess. A goddess who was born only to be loved.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> Even as a Heroic Spirit and a Servant, my divine core does not change.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> So...hehe! It&#39;s natural for Fujimaru to fall in love with me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> What is it? You look like you want to say something.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> N-No... I don&#39;t...</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> Oh, really? Are you sure about that? I see. I see. Hehe.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> You&#39;re cute, for a human, Mash Kyrielight.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yes, my Goddess.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> S-Senpai!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Senpai?</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fooouuuuuuuuuuuu...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Oh, jeez... I guess you&#39;re going into those caves. There isn&#39;t any treasure in there, though.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> GAAAAAAAA!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I sensed magical energy the instant we entered! Senpai!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> What did I tell you? There&#39;s still a phantasmal here. Is it a chimera? I bet it&#39;s a chimera. Those things are strong!</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> Oh my! What an ugly, fierce, miserable beast! It&#39;s not fair! I didn&#39;t know there was all this fun here!</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> Where did &quot;I&quot; find such a monster, I wonder? I want one too!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It&#39;s going to eat us before you can keep it as a pet! Here it comes!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai, your orders!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yes, my Goddess.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> S-Senpai! Jeez!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai!</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It&#39;s definitely some kind of charm! Completely under her spell!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Fou, bite Fujimaru! Then we can fight!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fo\u2013uuuu!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Did you come to your senses now? It&#39;s time for battle! Give me your orders!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> Whew, that was fun. I&#39;m not supposed to be this strong, you know.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Did assigning her an accurate Servant class make her stronger?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Either way, yeah. Good work\u2013</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> No, wait. There&#39;s more! This time there&#39;s lots! Lots more!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Mash, continue combat!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> R-Right, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> There was some weird snake, too, huh? I already have plenty of snakes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You do?</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> Oh\u2014Ahem. No, nothing, Mash. Anyway, this cave is tiny. Are we at a dead end already?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Well, if this was a real labyrinth I would&#39;ve opposed coming in here. Goddess, I&#39;m glad your sister went easy on us during that trial...</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> I see.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> ...Here it is. So this is what &quot;I&quot; was doing.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What&#39;s wrong?</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> ...Nothing. I&#39;ve seen what I came to see. Let&#39;s go.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ???</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Huh? What? Was something there?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What did you see?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Were you looking at something?</p><hr><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> It&#39;s nothing\u2013 Oh, jeez. Now even Fujimaru wants to know...</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> Don&#39;t worry about it. I just found something I expected to find.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> A message that &quot;I&quot; left for me. Or maybe a message that &quot;I&quot; left for her.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> It&#39;s nothing. Really.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> If by some chance, or miracle, she and I were to manifest in the same era...</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> That&#39;s impossible of course, but if it was possible... And then we never saw each other...</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> This was a short message from &quot;me,&quot; just in case that ever happened.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> She told &quot;me&quot; to never change. And for &quot;you&quot; to never change either.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> ...Wait, why are you making me say this? You&#39;re a cheeky human, Fujimaru!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m sorry, my Goddess.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Sorry for overstepping myself, Goddess.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai, again!?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fooou!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Some resistance to her charm should be present, but her spell is truly irresistable. That&#39;s what makes that Goddess so amazing.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> Of course. I&#39;m a Goddess, beloved by all.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> All you have to do is love me. Just adore me from afar.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> Don&#39;t even think about peeking at me or inside of me. Otherwise\u2013&quot;a beautiful snake&quot; will bite you!</p>',128),a=[n];function g(p,u){return t(),e("div",null,a)}var i=o(s,[["render",g],["__file","Euryale.html.vue"]]);export{i as default};
