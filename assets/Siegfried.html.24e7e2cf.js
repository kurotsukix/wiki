Is now a good time?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I don&#39;t mind.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Not a problem.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No, I don&#39;t mind.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> ...I see. Well, where to start...</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> You know how I am the &quot;Dragon Slayer?&quot;</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Of course, you defeated the evil dragon Fafnir, didn&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Yes. Afterward I bathed in its blood\u2013 and gained immortality from it.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Although, there is one part which was untouched by its blood. My back.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> ...Well, that I&#39;m aware of, at least.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Why wasn&#39;t it touched?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Why did you leave it?</p><hr><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Let&#39;s just say I had my reasons. I&#39;m terrible at explaining this.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> You see, because I bathed in Fafnir&#39;s blood\u2013 I can resonate with &quot;that dragon.&quot;</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> You could say it&#39;s like the relationship between Masters and Servants.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> However, the link is extremely weak. It only allows us to confirm each other&#39;s survival at best.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> During the battle in France, I was certain that Fafnir was destroyed, but...</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> It seems it&#39;s revived.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Wha...Fafnir has?!</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Master, I beg of you. Return to France, and this time slay the dragon.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Won&#39;t you take me with you?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> All right, I&#39;ll start monitoring... Multiple signatures of lifeforms confirmed.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It goes without saying, they&#39;re not human.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Please look at this, Master! There are wyverns among them!</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Did they survive that battle then recover? Or were they reborn?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> ...In any case, they must be destroyed. Aim for the wyverns first. Let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> ...It looks like we got them for now. Let&#39;s look for Fafnir.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A ruined fortress. It looks like the wyverns attacked it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But Doctor, I thought Fafnir was summoned by that Jeanne.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s possible she, too is\u2013</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> ...No, I doubt that.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Siegfried&#39;s correct.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> She needed the Grail to exist as a Servant, there&#39;s no sign of it in France.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> I&#39;m sure. ...I fear this is my fault.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Yours?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> By defeating Fafnir, I left behind a legend and became a Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> But, my very existence itself is also the proof that &quot;Fafnir exists.&quot;</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Not to mention it&#39;s already been summoned once here in France.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> So long as Fafnir isn&#39;t killed completely, it will keep reviving.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But I thought its Master, Jeanne no longer exists...</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Dragons generates magical energy simply by breathing.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> \u2013I see. Standing atop of all Phantasmals, they never have to worry about magical energy.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Living. Just by doing that, it&#39;s possible to generate magical energy!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master, it&#39;s the wyverns! They&#39;ve formed a pack and started to attack!</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> It&#39;s not easy being a &quot;Dragon Slayer.&quot; Master, let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> \u2013Hm. These wyverns were just born.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Born?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> When dragons become as large as Fafnir, they can bear offspring on their own.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Just like these.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Most of them are dead, but even if a few survive\u2013 they&#39;ll eventually be surrounded by strong fantasies.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Then new Evil Dragons will be born.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> It&#39;s because of that fear, we humans desperately fought the dragons.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Weren&#39;t you afraid?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You&#39;re brave.</p><hr><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> I appreciate that, Master. Unfortunately, I was afraid.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> I only killed the dragon because I was asked to. I suppose I&#39;m the type who\u2013just can&#39;t refuse a request.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> To all warriors, the title Dragon Slayer was an eternal honor. ...I won&#39;t deny that I was motivated by fame.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> But, it was so scary I regretted it immediately.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You still ended up victorious, right?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Yes, but as I said before, even I don&#39;t know how I won.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> When I came to, there was the bloody dragon and my bloodstained self. Its lair was dyed red.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> My skin which should have been badly burned was hardly hurt. ...It was strange, but I knew I had won.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Were you happy?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Of course. The dragon was slain and I thought I could devote my entire life to realizing that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Was it fun?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> ...Yes, it was fun. The moment I realized it, I gave an uncharacteristic shout.</p><hr><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> The treasure I gained eventually cast me into misfortune, but... I have no regrets or hesitations.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> I know it&#39;s not the most enlightened way to put it, but I accepted the circumstances of my life.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> I grant someone&#39;s wish. I accept their joy, their sadness, and their rage.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> ...And that was enough to give my life fulfillment. Except\u2013</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> !!! It seems our idle chatter is at an end.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> I&#39;ve located it\u2013 Which means it&#39;s located me, as well.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;ve picked up a massive signature incoming... No doubt about it, it&#39;s Fafnir!</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Now is the time to settle this! Let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> ...Farewell Fafnir. May you be destroyed, this time.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This is Mash. Fafnir&#39;s destruction confirmed.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Yes, I&#39;ve confirmed its destruction on my side as well. I&#39;m scanning, but there&#39;s no sign at all.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I think you managed to finish him off this time.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Now it seems Balmung too has regained its original power.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Can you continue with your story?</p><hr><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> ...There&#39;s nothing more to tell. We&#39;ll talk more next time we get the chance.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> I&#39;m grateful, let&#39;s return Master.</p><h2 id="in-search-of-das-rheingold" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#in-search-of-das-rheingold" aria-hidden="true">#</a> In Search of Das Rheingold</h2><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Master, Mash Kyrielight. Forgive me, but I have a request.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Is it Fafnir again\u2013?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> No, that dragon was completely destroyed. Please rest assured.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> But when the dragon revived, so did my lost Noble Phantasm. We must return to France and secure it\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We&#39;ve arrived.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...It&#39;s just as Siegfried said. I can sense a powerful presence.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I can confirm that, as well. Hang on while I find the shortest route.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What&#39;s the Noble Phantasm?</p><hr><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Have you never heard of the Rheingold?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The Rheingold ...The treasure you obtained.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s a mountain of treasures that couldn&#39;t be exhausted even by all the people of the era.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> That&#39;s an exaggeration. But it&#39;s enough to allow me, my children\u2013</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> and even my grandchildren to grow old in luxury and still have some left over.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> It&#39;s likely an aftereffect of Fafnir&#39;s resurrection. The Rheingold has been summoned, as well.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> There&#39;s evil surrounding the gold. If we don&#39;t secure it, there will be trouble.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Trouble how?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> For example... Suppose a man finds it. With one glance, the treasure would captivate him completely.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> The captivated man would naturally spend the treasure. Once he did, he would become known as its owner.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Eventually, everything around him\u2013will be drawn into a bloody struggle. The battle will drag on and spread like fire, without end.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> In the end, the nation will be consumed by atrocities and executions, treachery and perfidy.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> That&#39;s what Rheingold is. I regret having ever summoned it...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Understood. We need to prevent that from happening. Let&#39;s hurry to the location!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;ve got the route. Hurry!</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> ...The gold has begun to attract evil creatures. Let&#39;s break through, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Hm...</p><p><strong>Soldier A:</strong> That treasure... belongs to me!</p><p><strong>Soldier B:</strong> Quiet! That&#39;s mine!</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> We&#39;re too late. The mind corruption has already begun.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> We can disable them for now. Master, let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Will they be all right?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Once the Rheingold disappears from this nation, any related memories will also be erased and return to normal.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Let&#39;s hurry before we have casualties.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> We&#39;re almost at our destination. However, I am picking up multiple signatures around it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s spacious. ...Master, please stand back.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The signatures the Doctor mentioned are approaching!</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> We&#39;re done once we defeat these. What?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> ...It&#39;s been a while, my friend.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> You&#39;re!?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> No need to be surprised. You&#39;re not the only one who obtained the Rheingold.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> I, Hagen, killed you to acquire it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Hagen...I believe he was the one who killed Siegfried from behind...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It seems he was summoned using the Rheingold as the catalyst.</p><p><strong>Hagen:</strong> Exactly. Though, I only did it because this guy asked me. Right, my friend?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> ...If you think of me as a friend, stand aside Hagen.</p><p><strong>Hagen:</strong> I refuse. This treasure is mine. I killed you to obtain it.</p><p><strong>Hagen:</strong> I won&#39;t give it to a wench like Kriemhild. I won&#39;t give it to a coward like you who chose death!</p><p><strong>Hagen:</strong> This gold! This treasure! Everything is mine!</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> \u2013No matter what I say, it will only be an excuse.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> It&#39;s true that I am a coward. I should have stood firm, and found a way to break through.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> That tragedy was not one I schemed... Even then, there&#39;s no doubt that I am responsible.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> ...However. I will retrieve the Rheingold.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Not for my own greed, but because it is just.</p><p><strong>Hagen:</strong> \u2013Haha. Says the man who wielded his sword not knowing what is just!</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> You&#39;re correct. When I was alive, I wielded my sword in ignorance.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> However, lately I have finally been able to see my own righteousness.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> I will have my wish granted\u2013 Hagen!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Hagen:</strong> \u2013Hmph, ruin it is. That&#39;s fine, I didn&#39;t want this gold in the first place.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> What, you were just venting?</p><p><strong>Hagen:</strong> What else did you think it was?</p><p><strong>Hagen:</strong> ...I was happy when I could drink and joke with you.</p><p><strong>Hagen:</strong> I&#39;m the only one that could have assaulted you from behind in that situation.</p><p><strong>Hagen:</strong> I can see you wanted it to be by my blade, as you trusted me.</p><p><strong>Hagen:</strong> However\u2013did you not imagine that you would hurt my heart doing so?</p><p><strong>Hagen:</strong> Did you not think it would infuriate your wife Kriemhild?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> ...You&#39;re right. Seems I knew little about emotions.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> No, more than anything else\u2013since I was asked to, I believed nothing else could have been done.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> I showed excessive lack of interest in everything.</p><p><strong>Hagen:</strong> You neglected your life, your hope, and most of all your desires.</p><p><strong>Hagen:</strong> You may have been fine with that, but you should&#39;ve noticed those around you couldn&#39;t bear it.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> ...Yeah.</p><p><strong>Hagen:</strong> Then, let me ask you. \u2013Do you have any wish as you are now?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> I do. I had decided this from before. In this second life\u2013 I&#39;ll protect justice, and be proud of it.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> I care not about the opinions of others. I merely wish that &quot;I myself want to be as such.&quot;</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> My dream is\u2014to be a hero of justice.</p><p><strong>Hagen:</strong> ...Hmph, such a childish dream, much like you. But that is fine.</p><p><strong>Hagen:</strong> I will entrust the Rheingold to you. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be able to deal with it properly\u2014</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Master, this is what I couldn&#39;t tell you earlier. I neglected myself too much, and ended up causing tragedy.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> I will not repeat my mistake again. I want to become a hero of justice and prevent it.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Is it absurd... to wish for that?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Not at all.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It is not absurd.</p><hr><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> ...Thank you Master. I give you my best regards for the future.</p>',193),i=[s];function a(g,p){return t(),r("div",null,i)}var h=e(n,[["render",a],["__file","Siegfried.html.vue"]]);export{h as default};
