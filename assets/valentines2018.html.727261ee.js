Kiyohime, unworthy me, has made chocolate.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> To be precise, I \u201Cbecame\u201D chocolate rather than made it.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> If I can become a dragon by holding on to my feelings for a thousand years, becoming a chocolate is rather simple.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Come! I will be the personification of that cheesy tagline!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> I will melt in your mouth\u2013 but definitely not...in...your...hand\u2606</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> By the way, if I transform my entire body in chocolate, I would be roughly 240,000 calories\u266A</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> You can cut me into pieces and eat me up later if you want to.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That would be a crime!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What is this, a dream?</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong> Well, well, I wonder what kind of nightmare you witnessed?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Perhaps something like \u201CThe tiger now hath seized the gentle hind?\u201D</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Well, Ms. K...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Oh, I see. It is almost Valentine&#39;s Day.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I can&#39;t remember...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> A nightmare so terrible you couldn&#39;t even remember, I see.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> But, if it&#39;s a nightmare that can even torture our Master, I have no doubt its content is related to Ms. K.</p><hr><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> ...That aside... Hello, my Master!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> I, Shakespeare, the most renowned literary writer in the world, have come to destroy your golden slumber!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Why? You may ask. No reason, I am simply here to wake you up.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> From you? That&#39;s rare.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> I am sure you&#39;d think that way. After all, Lady Mash is the usually the one to wake you up.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Unfortunately, as you may be aware, she&#39;s battling with chocolate at the moment.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Where&#39;s Mash?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Well, well, have you forgotten, Master?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> All of the female Servants, including her, are spending all their time on chocolate.</p><hr><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Some of them... Like Lady Artemis, for example, is making the chocolate for their true love.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Lady Mata Hari, Lady Antoinette, and Lady Boudica seem to be making chocolate for everybody.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> I guess you could call those types of chocolate, friendship chocolate.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Also, although it&#39;s only my own speculation, I have an eerie feeling about what they might get in return on White Day, except Lady Boudica.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> I mean, the majority of male Servants probably never received a chocolate in their life, and glare at the world with eyes that look like the Tibetan Fox.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Well, there are also Servants who don&#39;t care much about this kind of occasion, but that&#39;s that.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> \u201CIt (Jealousy) is the green-eyed monster which doth mock the meat it feeds on.\u201D</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> ...That&#39;s the saying, no?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Would they be happy to get one from me?</p><hr><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Ohhh, Master&#39;s handmade chocolate! That would make any Servant happy!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Servants are emotional entities. If they get chocolate from you, you can expect them to work extra hard.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> In that case, let&#39;s go join the ladies and make some chocolate with them!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Hmm, someone appears to be running around the halls. I urge you to exercise care, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Wh-What&#39;s going on?</p><hr><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Wh-What&#39;s happening? An attack on Chaldea?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> They seem to have run into the simulator room. Shall we pursue them?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yes!</p><hr><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Understood!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Well, well, Master! I shall be rooting for you, so please go finish this quickly!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Hmm, that was some good exercise, wasn&#39;t it Master? However, what is this Servant?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> It looks like a Shadow Servant, but with a much paler color...</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> More than anything\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> This...smells like chocolate...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> This... sweet fragrance...</p><hr><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Yes, that&#39;s it! I know what they are now\u2013</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong> Where? Where is it?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> ...Oh? The adorable, flustered thing over there is...</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> Oh my, Master. Say, did you happen to see a chocolate sprinting around here?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...What did you say?</p><hr><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> A chocolate I said. I am not sure what happened but...</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> ...the chocolate I melted in a bain-marie\u200B started to fuse together, took human form, and all of a sudden ran away.</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> It sure is mysterious, isn&#39;t it? What should we do, Master?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Oh... Chocolate... ran...away...you say!?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> In other words, let&#39;s call the entities we&#39;ve just met \u201CChoco-Servants!\u201D</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> Now what do I do... I put some a secret spell on it that allows it to turn into a jewel.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s way too magical...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What kind of alchemist are you?</p><hr><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> Hehehe, if you pour enough love into your chocolate, it&#39;s only natural for it to do that.</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> Please be sure to remember that because it&#39;s very important, Master\u266A</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> This has turned into an extremely fascinating event, Master!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> But please rest assured, Master. I thought something like this might happen!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Prepare for the impossible!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> I have called upon some Servants with unusual senses of smell to track down those chocolates.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Let&#39;s use their scarily keen senses of smell derived from their unpopulari... I mean jealousy, and take back those chocolates!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;re behind this aren&#39;t you!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I know what your final Ascension looks like...</p><hr><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Hahahaha, you sure like to jest, Master!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> ...If I were behind this commotion, I would surely make the chocolate escape with more drama, more tragedy!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Therefore, I promise I am only acting out of the kindness in my heart.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Ah, I can see distrust in my Master&#39;s eyes. Heh heh, I guess my legacy can be both good and evil at times!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Ahhh, heaters and blankets are the best on a cold day like this... Good, it feels so good...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I know I have a lot to do, but snuggling in this blanket next to a heater somehow makes me feel like everything will be all right.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Truly, this just feels too good... No wonder humanity has fallen...</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Pardon me for interrupting your self-degenerating fantasy, but you really have to stop being useless when we need you.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Ouch, that hurts! That brought me back to reality! Can you stop with the kind of insults that cuts you to the core?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Wait, what? Shakespeare?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Rayshift preparation? Chocolate? Escape? Oh, hold on a moment.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> No, wait a minute. What&#39;s going on?

Aren&#39;t you curious about the \u201Cmastermind\u201D Lord Caesar mentioned?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> However, haste makes waste.

It&#39;s sad, but all of this is part of my plan\u2014</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I knew that.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> As expected of my Master... I am impressed that you noticed.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Ah, yes.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> As expected of my Master... That calmness is fit for someone who will save the world.</p><hr><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> We&#39;re here... Lord Caesar incites people with his words, Lord Hohenheim changes people with his attitude.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Please be careful, Master. Mages are like an author&#39;s deadline.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> If you believe without thinking, you will pay for it later.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> A deadline of Friday EOD means it&#39;s okay by Monday morning. Depending on the situation, you can even turn it in by Monday night!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I see, you can&#39;t trust him!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Aren&#39;t you embarrassed for saying that?</p><hr><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> \u2013Wait, wait a minute. Please listen to me first.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> What is chocolate anyway, Master? That&#39;s right, it&#39;s a snack made from cocoa beans.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> With its abundant sugar, chocolate is sweet and the calories and fat are also overpowering.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> ...Currently, there are countless female Servants in Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> They give away chocolates, and if Master eats all of them, it wouldn&#39;t be good for Master&#39;s health.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> However, simply destroying the chocolates won&#39;t do\u2013 They will simply make more on the spot.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> Besides, if I do that, they&#39;ll kill me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I know right...</p><hr><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> However, Holy Chocolate War, where people fight over chocolates... I can&#39;t let that happen either.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> The world must be forever peaceful and serene. That&#39;s when I finally came up with my idea.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> That&#39;s right, all I need to do is to eliminate chocolate as an ingredient.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Indeed! How exceedingly logical of you!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> This is a little bit extreme, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Isn&#39;t this way of thinking a bit dangerous?</p><hr><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> A mage like me even agonizes over the question if I should use spells like the ones you see in fairytales.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> ...Well, I thought it would be good to fulfill a girl&#39;s wish in the process.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> A girl?</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> Sorry, I talk too much.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> Therefore, I don&#39;t regret anything. I&#39;ll do the same thing over and over again.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Whose wish did you grant?</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> I cannot reveal that. Revealing a girl&#39;s secret is the act of an evil man.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> It&#39;s incredibly convincing when you say that, you know!</p><hr><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> \u2013Now, I think we have reached a mutual understanding... That our opinions will reach an agreement.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> So there is only one thing to do. With this magical sword of Paracelsus\u2013</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> I will persuade (brainwash) you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Did you just say brainwash?</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> That&#39;s sad... I think you might&#39;ve misheard.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What was that in the parentheses?</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> Are you saying that&#39;s my true intention? I wonder what you mean by that?</p><hr><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> In any case, cooking is just mixing ingredients. If it&#39;s mixing stuff, nothing beats alchemy.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> I have my own opinion regarding chocolate making. I will prove the justice in my plan through this fight!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> ...I&#39;ve lost... However... I&#39;m sad...</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> When I think about how Master would walk the path of carnage...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;ll be all right. No problem.</p><hr><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> ...And... My heart aches just thinking about how you have to eat that idol&#39;s chocolate...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Ah.</p><hr><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Master... You were so preoccupied on chasing chocolates, you forgot about that, right?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> No matter what this idol makes, negative adjustment will happen and turn her creation into a mysterious substance...</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> No... Before all of that.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Even if the majority of the Servants possess knowledge of chocolate, for most of them this is their first time cooking.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> ...It would be best to ask Lady Da Vinci for some stomach medicine beforehand.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> In case you need this... Please drink it... It&#39;s made from ancient spirit grass. If it&#39;s your stomach, it should protect it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Thank you!</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> But... You&#39;ll lose your sense of taste...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> If it&#39;s my stomach?</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> It won&#39;t protect... Your tongue...</p><hr><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> Farewell then, Master. At the very least, please don&#39;t rob little girls of their dreams\u2013</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Little girls&#39; dreams, you say? The most fragile yet sturdy thing in this world.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Yearning for eternity and peace, it is a world where violence and barbarism are alien.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> ...Nonetheless, I&#39;m fully aware it&#39;s a unrefined existence. Therefore we must go destroy that dream!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Having fun?</p><hr><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Of course! The commotion this time is a tale fit to relax people.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> I will do my best to fulfill my role as your buddy!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> However, Paracelsus disappeared without telling us anything about the girl, we could really use some hints.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> ...Huh? Please take a look at this, Master.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> This is...a doll, isn&#39;t it? Also a gigantic candy and a picture book.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> ...A picture book?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That means\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> We will reveal the culprit...

Would you please give those Choco-Servants back to us?</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> Why?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> They are lifeforms based off the Valentine chocolates made by the female Servants.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> If they don&#39;t go back, the ladies won&#39;t be able to finish making their chocolates.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> No way, you can&#39;t take them!
