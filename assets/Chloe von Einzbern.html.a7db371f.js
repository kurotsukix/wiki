I&#39;m not complaining about your technique or anything...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> But I just...want to feel something else...like butterflies in my stomach.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Um, not in front of Mash...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No, no, go on. This may be something I need to hear.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Please continue, Chloe. Depending on what you have to say, I may have to contact the authorities.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Mash, you look a little scary.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This is my default expression. My various emotions are typically not reflected in my catalog of expressions.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So please carry on. As you can see, I am quite calm.</p><hr><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> Oh no, did I hit a nerve?</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> Normally, I&#39;d keep prodding and hope for some good drama...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> But since Mash is a good girl, I&#39;ll leave it alone.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> O-okay...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So you were asking if you couldstrengthen your power during battle?</p><hr><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> Right. I came over to see if there was anything we could do to improve the situation.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> If you can increase the magical energy supplied to me, I can increase my output, which will help everyone.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I-I didn&#39;t realize that&#39;s what you were talking about. I just thought...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> You thought...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> N-no! Nothing at all!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So this is about getting stronger. I believe this is one of the most important topics to discuss here in Chaldea. Absolutely, yes.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> Yep, yep. You really are cute, Mash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I don&#39;t know why...but I feel like I was just teased by an older sister or something...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> I think they&#39;re around here somewhere.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We tagged along because you asked us to, but why did you take us here?</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> I heard there&#39;s good snacks around here. I figured I could taste them all at once.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> Ah! I smell something delectable over there!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um...what happened to you getting stronger?</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> There they are! Over there! Hide, so they don&#39;t see you!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> They are...</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> Tea time\u266A</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Tea, tea, tea...ocha in Japanese\u266A</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> T-tee...</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong> Chacha!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Are they having a tea party? That&#39;s so adorable...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Though they seem to be a bit lacking in terms of vocabulary...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> Heh heh heh... Every single one of them looks to be positively brimming with magical energy...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Gasp! D-don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re going to...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> Yep, I&#39;m going to start snacking...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> By sucking their magical energy!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> Down to the last drop!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> Suck suck suck!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Wh-what!?</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> If there&#39;s a girl that I&#39;m super compatible with, my charge efficiency will go way up!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> That&#39;s why I&#39;m going to sample them one by one!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Th-that makes sense on paper, but...n-no!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Th-that&#39;s not right... In fact, it may be criminal!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> It&#39;s fine, it&#39;s fine. I won&#39;t do anything that would traumatize them\u2661</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> All I have to do is make sure they don&#39;t remember. That just means I gotta fight them.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> Either way, I don&#39;t think they&#39;re going to let me suck them directly, so I&#39;ll do it after I knock them out.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> S-she&#39;s thinking like a random serial attacker!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I shall call this \u201COperation Serial Kisser.\u201D</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master!?</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> That&#39;s good! I&#39;m getting excited now!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> Tea tea tea tea tea\u266A</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Tea, tea, chachacha! Chachacha-tea!</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Teee...hee hee...</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong> Chacha!!! We&#39;re talking about Chacha, aren&#39;t we!? Wahahaha!!!</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong> By the way, why are we all only saying \u201Ctea\u201D and \u201Ccha\u201D?</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> Eh? Are we allowed to talk normally?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> We thought chanting \u201Ccha cha\u201D was customary in a Japanese tea party.</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong> A tea ceremony isn&#39;t this wacky! A Japanese tea ceremony is a social gathering that mixes etiquette and being fashionable!</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> I feel things went off the rails somewhat when Chacha started randomly shouting \u201CChacha!\u201D</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong> Chacha!?</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme &amp; Jack:</strong> Cha-cha-cha!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> This is so stupid it&#39;s hurting my head...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Setting matters of intellect aside, those girls are all pure and innocent.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> For you to attack them and...k-k-kiss them... I don&#39;t think we can permit such an immoral act...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> Yeehaw! Let&#39;s go! It&#39;s time to make some flowers bloom!</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong> Wh-what the!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> CHLOE!!!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> Cha...</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Chaaaaaa...</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> I-I feel like we&#39;re being handled...</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong> ...crudely! ...Unnnf...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Battle complete. ...So it&#39;s finally happening...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> A sacrifice for the greater good.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m sure this will also come back to haunt you, Senpai. But there&#39;s nothing we can do about it now, is there?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> We. Saw. Nothing. Got it?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This is definitely something I won&#39;t want to witness!</p><hr><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> Whew. They fought hard, but they were no match for the Serial Kisser Squad.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> And now we&#39;re a part of this shameful group!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> Now that they&#39;ve all passed out...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> Time for a taste\u2606</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> Hm...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh...my...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Ahhh...w-wow...that sound...ahhhh! That&#39;s too much...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> S-Senpai! I don&#39;t think this is right! This is...this is SO wrong in SO many ways!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s just kids playing. It&#39;s fine.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It&#39;s only an exchange of magical energy. It&#39;s fine.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Y-you really think so?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> N-no, you&#39;re right. The...methodology may be troubling, but it really just amounts to a medical procedure.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It is just one way to exchange magical energy. Yes... So there is no problem here...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...No problem...I hope...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> Ummmmmmf... Phew!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> ...Wanna try, Mash?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ABSOLUTELY NOT!!!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> In the end, none of them were compatible. I&#39;m disappointed...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I feel sorry for them...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> I was hoping the ponytail witch Medea Lily would be the one... But even though she was unconscious, she had really strong magical resistance!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> She was the hardest to deal with, despite how she looks. She&#39;s probably got a lot more going on than meets the eye.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Really? Out of those four, I feel she has the most common sense. ...Although that can be its own burden.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So, boss. Who&#39;s your next victim?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> As much as I respect your adaptability, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s working in your favor this time, Senpai.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> The Serial Kisser Squad&#39;s journey continues...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> It&#39;s good that you&#39;re really into my cause, but quit acting like that, it&#39;s gonna end up making things take a bad turn (read: get us shut down).</p><hr><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> Okay, next. I went after kiddos last time, so maybe I should look for a stronger girl this time.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> Maybe I should find myself a king, or...oh! Maybe a Berserker...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I predict a whole different kind of disaster from last time.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...To be quite clear, disaster beyond reckoning is sure to ensue.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Is it girls only?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You don&#39;t want boys?</p><hr><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> Eh? When it comes to boys, I wouldn&#39;t want them to get serious with me... None of them are my type anyway.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> Oh wait... There are maybe one or two good ones, but those guys...you know...honestly...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I-I don&#39;t know how to respond to that. I can only surmise that you have a very complicated situation here.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> So there you have it. Now let&#39;s keep looking for other girls with potential.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> Girls like the last ones, the sort who aren&#39;t challenging, are just boring... I wanna try getting a strong girl to submit to me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You are much too gung-ho about these morally questionable endeavors!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> Hmmm, is there anyone around? A cute and strong and stimulating girl...and possibly a Saber who&#39;s compatible with my class.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> Yoohoo, are there any girl kings swinging their swords around here...?</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> After I give her a gentle thrashing, I wanna nurse her back to health with the utmost care and tenderness!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Where&#39;s the patient!?</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> ...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> A wild head nurse appears.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Welp, you hoped for a Berserker. There you go.</p><hr><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> No, no, no! She&#39;s no good! I was trying to put up a flag to lure someone like Altria or Altera!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That last bit might have pushed her over the edge. She&#39;s gone berserk herself.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Do not fret. Now that I&#39;m here, I will thoroughly expunge this mental anguish troubling you.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> It will not be unnecessarily painful... That is, it will be excruciating, even highly traumatic, but that is only because it is necessary.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Sadly, there is no anesthesia to numb pain of the heart or soul. I must ask you to grit your teeth and bear it.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> We can&#39;t reason with her! Figures! Wh-what are we going to do with her? There&#39;s no way I can handle her!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> No, no. There is nothing that cannot be handled. Your perspective in this is all wrong.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> What cannot be dealt with simply must be amputated. All that is necessary to sustain a patient&#39;s life is to keep the vital organs intact.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Despair only when there&#39;s nothing left to amputate!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> It may sound like we&#39;re having a conversation, but you&#39;re actually talking to yourself! Argh! This is why Madness Enhancement EX is impossible to deal with!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Come on, that&#39;s a stimulating girl for you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I thought you wanted to have a strong girl submit to you?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> S-Senpai!? Please don&#39;t egg Chloe on!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> A-are you telling me to attack her? Seriously? Are you NUTS?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You can do it, Chloe.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Break through common sense and morality!</p><hr><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> ...Heh.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> You&#39;re right. What was I thinking? Being scared of dessert (read: women) is so unlike me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> U-um Chloe? You&#39;re kidding, right? You&#39;re not really going to...?</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> The Serial Kissers never turn their backs on their prey! As long as there&#39;s a girl around, I&#39;ll try to jump them from behind!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> Those lips of yours will be mine! Brace yourself, head nurse! Or rather...!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> Kill\u2606Kill\u2606Nurse!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Take my lips...? Did you just say you mean to take my lips from me?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Manpower, medicine, bandages, bed, and other resources are all being taken and running low! And now you&#39;re trying to take away my lips too!?</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> Oops. I already decided I wouldn&#39;t talk to you. Instead of filling your mouth with words, I&#39;m going to fill it with something warm and wet!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> I understand now. You are poison. You are the danger. You are an infection that must be eradicated!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Kill\u2606Kill\u2606Germs!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (Gasp!) I&#39;m sorry! I could not intervene during that intense and bizarre back and forth.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But...yes. Commencing battle! Good luck!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That...was an intense battle.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Had this been a manga,that battle would have taken three volumes.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re saying, but it truly was an epic battle...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> And I learned from this battle that fighting can be completely empty and futile... I have never in all my life felt so sad...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> I managed to get a strong woman to submit to me, just like I wanted... It&#39;s nothing like I expected, though.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> Whew... I&#39;m beat, so I should go home and take a shower.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> W-wait! Did you forget your initial plan?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> If you leave now, what was the point in fighting Nightingale!?</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> I forgot. Oh, right, right.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> But do I really have to? I&#39;m kind of over it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> After all that effort...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You can&#39;t give up just because you got sick of it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You need to take responsibility till the very end.</p><hr><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> Okay... This is such a mood killer, but I guess I have to do it.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> Then, here I go... Hmf...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;re watching pretty intently, huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Why don&#39;t you have her do it to you too, Mash?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I-I&#39;m not looking, and I don&#39;t want to get involved!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> ...Pfaaah!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> H-how did it go, Chloe?</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> Well, you know... I kinda expected it, but...she tasted like antiseptic.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ah, well that makes sense, but I really wasn&#39;t asking how she tasted...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> Oh you mean, magical energy? That was so-so too. I suppose I was wrong to expect more from a Berserker in the first place...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> ...Wrong.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> Eh?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Wrong...! Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong!!! Everything is wrong!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Nightingale&#39;s awake! No, perhaps she was never unconscious...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> So what am I wrong about!?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Everything! Your resuscitation procedure is totally wrong!!!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> Huh? Resuscitation!? Huh!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, Nightingale just reached out and grabbed Chloe&#39;s throat...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> First, find the airway! Tilt the face sideways, and if there is anything inside the mouth, scoop it out with your fingers!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> Bleeah... Your finger...! Ack!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Lift the chin up, pinch the nose, and blow in with all your might for one second!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> Hey, I\u2013hrmgh! Ack!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I don&#39;t think you need to breathe with all your might...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> But most important are chest compressions! Punch the chest one hundred times per minute to force the heart to restart!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> (Cough) ...Heart!? But it didn&#39;t stop... Ow...owowowowowowowowowow!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Multiple hits with no rest between them!?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> ...You have just witnessed a chief modern medical technique to combat death. It is known as CPR.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> ...That isn&#39;t...right...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um. I don&#39;t know how to react to that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That was a wonderful demonstration. The only thing that was unfortunate was that, rather than being a resuscitation exercise, it is guaranteed to kill the targum, patient.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Mash. Should your respiratory organs shut down, come to me immediately. I will be sure to resuscitate you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> N-no thank you! Um, I&#39;m fine with Chaldea&#39;s medical equipment!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> I-I thought I was gonna die... Ungh...what did I get myself into...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Nightingale really was unexpected. By the way, are you familiar with the phrase \u201Cwhat goes around, comes around\u201D?</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> Hmmm, nope.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> Oh? There&#39;s a flyer posted in the hallway. Actually, there&#39;s a ton out here. Let&#39;s see what it says.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> \u201CWarning: Serial kisser on the loose\u201D</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> \u201CFemale Servants should stay in their rooms.\u201D</p><hr><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> What the heck is this!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Looks like word of Chloe&#39;s evil doings has spread. Perhaps now your wicked quest will come to an end.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> But I haven&#39;t finished playing around... I mean...I still haven&#39;t found someone who&#39;s compatible with me!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Time to quit...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> The Serial Kisser Squad will be dissolved...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Indeed. We got dragged into this because of Chloe&#39;s insistence, but that will now come to an end. We cannot overlook your deeds any more.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> If you continue to corrupt Chaldea&#39;s morals, I will stand in your way as Chaldea&#39;s shield!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> Mash is betraying me now!? Unbelievable... Desertion will not be permitted!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> Come on! Don&#39;t be such a square just because you wear glasses! You dummy! You...Mashmallow Goody Two-shoes!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I never once joined your squad, and I am not acting like a square. Also I don&#39;t understand why you&#39;d call me Mashmallow.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> Ungh... That Shielder is so serious. Fine. Be that way.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Whew. I&#39;m glad she listened.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> But there&#39;s one thing I want you to know: it may seem like I was playing around, but I really did want to make myself stronger.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> I want to get strong for Fujimaru... No, I wanted to be useful for [\u2642 big brother /\u2640\uFE0F big sister}...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Chloe...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Don&#39;t worry. I believe you. Sometimes you may go overboard, but I also know you have an inherent kindness within you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> As for you getting stronger... Let&#39;s think about it together. I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll find something for you.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> Thanks. But...it&#39;s fine.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Eh? But...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> Is this it? We&#39;re coming in.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong> Huh, Chloe? What&#39;s going on?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We&#39;re in...Illya&#39;s room?</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong> Mash! And [\u2642 big brother /\u2640\uFE0F big sister} Fujimaru too! What great timing!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong> Someone in red was teaching me how to make sweets. I just finished up a batch.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong> I&#39;ll brew up some tea, so let&#39;s have them together.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What a wonderful, kind invitation. Even though you&#39;re so young, you are very domestic, Illya.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> What is this feeling? I feel secure, as if I&#39;m in my childhood home. And I simultaneously sense a newlywed and old-wifey aura from her...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> Yeah...I knew it all along... In the end, everyone wants to go back to Illya.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong> I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about... Oh, by the way! Chloe, you should be careful too!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong> I heard that there&#39;s some serial attacker lurking around in Chaldea! There&#39;s tons of victims already!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Uh...um...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong> Hm?</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> That&#39;s me.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong> ...Come again?</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> And now I&#39;m here to make you my last victim.</p><p><strong>Illya &amp; Mash:</strong> ...Come AGAIN!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So you knew from the beginning.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> The one most compatible to you is Illya.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> W-wait a minute...! Um...um...what you&#39;re trying to say is...?</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> Yep. The ones I attacked before were just for fun. I always knew the one most compatible with me was Illya!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I was foolish to believe in Chloe even for a minute!!!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> I&#39;m running low on magical energy from that last battle! I&#39;m gonna suck you harder than usual, Illya!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong> Eh? What!? What&#39;s going on!? Somebody explain!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Please run, Illya!!!</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong> Waaaaaah!!! Something like this always happens to me!!!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> Yahoo!!! It&#39;s hunting time!!!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> How did we end up chasing her all the way to a forest...?</p><hr><p><strong>Illya:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong> ... (Cough) ...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> Yep. Delicious.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> That&#39;s the familiar taste I enjoyed in Miyama. I think the fact that it&#39;s nothing out of the ordinary is proof that I succeeded.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh... So in the end, I could not prevent Chloe&#39;s barbarism... I failed to defend Chaldea&#39;s morality...</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> Illya doesn&#39;t count. We&#39;re like twins. Just think of it as sisterly bonding.</p><p><strong>Illya:</strong> ... (Twitch, twitch)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> And this is the result of that bonding?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> N-no...I&#39;m not going to comment on Chloe&#39;s bizarre morality anymore.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So you found an efficient source of magical energy.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Can we expect you to be better in battle?</p><hr><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> Of course! From now on, if Illya is by my side, I&#39;ll just keep sucking from her!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> I&#39;m kinda disappointed I never found another snack other than Illya, but I&#39;ll just keep looking on my own time.</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> And whenever Illya&#39;s not around, I&#39;m counting on you to supply me with magical energy, okay Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Leave it to me!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Leave it to me! Always!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...May I interject? I just remembered my first question about all of this...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Do you do it...with Senpai...normally?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (Silence)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> No comment.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You know...with Chloe...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> DOING SUCH THINGS AS THIS!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (Silence)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> No comment.</p><hr><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> Ahahaha! I knew Mash was jealous!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Th-that&#39;s not what this is about!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The magical energy necessary for a Servant to manifest is supplied by Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s why...there should be no need to siphon extra from other Servants...let alone from Master!</p><p><strong>Chloe:</strong> I know.
