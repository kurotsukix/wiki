At times the truth is too brutal, so we paint over it with our dreams.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> ...However, there are those who embrace delusions. They crush the truth, and delight us with deception.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> \u2013That is to say, to be frank, I will not forgive &quot;Dracula.&quot; Not ever.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> \u2013Are you awake?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What&#39;s happening now?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Has something happened?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I-I&#39;m sorry, Master. I know it&#39;s late.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But Vlad has something he wants to talk to you about.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> \u2013It&#39;s mixed.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What is?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Mixed?</p><hr><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> My memories. You see, I was born the second son of my father, Vlad II, and was ruler of Wallachia.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Although I was driven to misfortune, I have no regrets over my life.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> However\u2013since my materialization as a Servant, I have been haunted by a different memory.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Could those be of\u2013Dracu...</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> \u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I apologize. Please continue your story.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> You&#39;re right. The memories of that dreaded vampire. People I&#39;ve never seen before glare at me, and try to drive a stake through my heart.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> ...The hearts of men! They are full of absurd naivety and incorrigible stubbornness.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> They affix imaginary personalities, imaginary histories, and imaginary stories to reality.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> But they have no idea how much trouble those affected are going through. Therefore, heed my orders.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Travel with me to a different era, and eliminate the imaginary history. \u2013It should be easy.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Even imaginings are based on real tales, and those tales have authors.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> We will bring an end to them. It should be easy for us. \u2013Don&#39;t tell me, you&#39;re going to say no?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Let&#39;s go.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Of course not.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...W-Well, that&#39;s right. Defamation is a problem that can&#39;t be ignored.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Regardless of the outcome, or how we arrived at it... Revealing the truth is the right thing to do.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You think we can?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. At least I think so.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Once we start tracking Dra...&#39;s footsteps, the place with the highest magical energy response...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...will most likely be the origin of Dra...&#39;s legends.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s just that... Can the commonly known legend of Dra... be erased that easily?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Why are you still talking? I gave you an order. Hurry and make haste.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Y-Yes, sir. All right, let&#39;s get going.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We&#39;re in London. We&#39;re picking up a strong magical energy response here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Most likely, the biggest difference between the original Vlad and the vampire Vlad is whether he visited London or not.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Normally, Vlad has no connection with this place whatsoever.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> \u2013So, this is London. I see. What a dreadful place.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Naturally, Mina Harker and Lucy Westenra never actually existed.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> However, it&#39;s possible there were actual women being attacked, and having their blood sucked\u2013 Women who resembled the characters.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Fine. Commence your investigation.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Y-Yes, sir.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But we have no clues at all. Doctor, do you have anything on your end?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Well... I have picked up several small traces of magical energy.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> But it&#39;s hard to say if those are powerful enough to establish the legend of Dracula.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Hmm...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> But I&#39;ll keep trying!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> \u2013No, that&#39;s fine. I&#39;m well aware of your devotion to this task. However, it vexes me that there&#39;s nothing I can do.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> It&#39;s true that later generations would brand me a tyrant for my reign.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> However\u2013even so, I am sure it wasn&#39;t enough for people to start calling me Dracul.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Vlad...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> That was\u2013the cry of a woman!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I picked up a strong magical energy response. Mash, you should go take a look.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> I will accompany you. Right\u2013I hope we run into this vampire.</p><p><strong>Woman:</strong> Please...stop...</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> \u2013&quot;Kazikli Bey.&quot;</p><p><strong>Woman:</strong> What?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> ...I see. This is quite intriguing. Look, Mash and my Master!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Completely unfitting for this era, for this place\u2013 On appearance alone, this is indeed &quot;Dracul.&quot;</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This is...</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> A monster that transforms into a bat, and preys on human flesh\u2013 Truly despicable.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Prepare for your death, you heinous bat. In my current rage, I don&#39;t care if you&#39;re the Devil himself... I&#39;ll crush you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That sound just now...</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> It looks like he&#39;s calling his allies. Fine. Saves me the trouble of hunting them down. How efficient.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Oh how I wish every war was like this. Wouldn&#39;t you agree, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You are absolutely right.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Let&#39;s crush them all right here.</p><hr><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> I couldn&#39;t agree more, Master!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Let the devastation commence! Otherwise\u2013show us just how much of a devil you are!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Hmph. Perish without a trace, you filthy beasts.</p><p><strong>Woman:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> You, girl.</p><p><strong>Woman:</strong> Y-Yes?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Worry not. This beast shall no longer trouble you. Return to your home, and indulge in peaceful slumber.</p><p><strong>Woman:</strong> Y-Yes, sir. Pardon me\u2013 What is your name, sir?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Vlad III. Remember it.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Hmm. I believe it&#39;s safe to assume the history has returned to its proper path.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Ah, yes. I think\u2013this will do the trick.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Magnificent! Then let us return.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Sorry for forcing you to accompany me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> N-No, not at all. It&#39;s quite all right.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Yes. Tonight you should rest as much as you like. I will be in my spirit form.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Excuse me, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Even if we correct history, the chance for the legend of Dracula to be erased is...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Pretty low?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Almost none at all?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Yes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But, for Vlad\u2013this IS his wish for the Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Who knows what might actually happen?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But at the very least, people&#39;s perception of Vlad III might change\u2013 That would be a miracle.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> All we can do now is hope and watch.</p><h2 id="legend-of-dracula-ii" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#legend-of-dracula-ii" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Legend of Dracula II</h2><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Hm... London again? We&#39;ve already taken care of that devil... Is there something else?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m not sure, but we picked up something in in the area.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Perfect, then! Even the defeat of a small foe would be a worthy addition to my legend!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> My name remains infamous, but I shall not be known as demonic nor as vampiric.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Very well. Let&#39;s go, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Let&#39;s do our best!</p><hr><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> ...Ah. It seems we&#39;ve found it. It seems our foe is a mere wraith this time, rather than a devil.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, but that doesn&#39;t mean it is not malicious. The Demonic Fog still seems to be lingering in the city.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It may normally be \u201Cjust a wraith,\u201D but right now it&#39;s a deadly evil spirit.</p><p><strong>Woman:</strong> Heeelp...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Let&#39;s go rescue her!</p><hr><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Oh, I know. I shall do what I did before: Kazikli Bey!</p><p><strong>Woman:</strong> Wh-what!?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Woman. Stand back.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> That creature has crept into your world, but it is a being that should not exist.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Touch it and you will die. If you value your life, leave!</p><p><strong>Woman:</strong> B-but, but...I can&#39;t...move...!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Oh... Then I have no choice. Master, stay back and protect her.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> I shall impale that wraith. Normally, my stakes are reserved for punishment...</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> To threaten to harm civilians even after death... Unforgivable! I shall destroy you!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Vanished like the mist. How petty.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> But with the Singularity gone, how could there be a problem with evil spirits...?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> I suppose I should expect as much from a demonic city like London...</p><p><strong>Woman:</strong> U-um. Thank...you...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Get home safe.</p><hr><p><strong>Woman:</strong> Thank you very much...!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> ...Wait.</p><p><strong>Woman:</strong> Y-yes?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> My name is Vlad III. Remember it, keep it within your heart, and live the rest of your life to your fullest.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> And listen.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Some of the things I do may seem odd, but I am in no way related to vampires.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Understood?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> UNDERSTOOD?</p><p><strong>Woman:</strong> Y-yes!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> ...Hm. Now at least that woman will never think of me as a vampire.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Well, let&#39;s continue. Mash Kyrielight, have you found anything?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Y-yes... In the northern part of the city, there is a response very similar to the devil we just saw.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> However, just like last time, it is a weak response.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...This is just speculation, but there is a high possibility that it&#39;s a Demonic Beast that we&#39;re just assuming is a devil.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s likely here because of the residual Demonic Fog still in the area.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Or perhaps it was summoned for some purpose related to magecraft.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This is... Could this be a summoning circle of some sort?</p><p><strong>Man:</strong> A monster! Monster!!!</p><p><strong>Man:</strong> Get to safety now! Hey, you too...!</p><p><strong>Man:</strong> It&#39;s surely the devil!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Ah. So this is the devil. Laughable. It&#39;s no more than a beast gone mad.</p><p><strong>Man:</strong> H-hey, you...!?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> I shall quite literally rip you to shreds!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> What trifling nuisances. Such pathetic opponents may even weaken my spear.</p><p><strong>Man:</strong> Wh-who the hell are you?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Ah. You ask my name. Then I shall answer.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> My name is Vlad Tepes. You there, repeat it...</p><p><strong>Man:</strong> U-um...Vlad Tepes?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Correct. If it&#39;s hard to say, you may simply call me Vlad III. Either way, there&#39;s one very important thing you must remember.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Listen well: Vlad III is NOT a vampire.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Repeat!!!</p><p><strong>Man:</strong> Vlad III is not...a vampire?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Very good!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Now all that&#39;s left is the mage. I will not ask him to come to me.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> No...I&#39;ll chase him round perdition&#39;s flames before I give him up. I shall show them what it is to be Lord Impaler.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong> ...Wh-who the hell are you guys?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> You do not know me? I am Vlad Tepes\u2013</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong> Vlad III...of Wallachia? You lie. Lord Vlad perished long ago!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Yes, that is correct. I fought and died as the ruler of Wallachia.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> What is done is done. The story of my life has been swallowed in the annals of history. However, I will not tolerate anyone who glosses over the truth in later years.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong> ...What are you talking about?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> There&#39;s no need for you to know. After all, I&#39;m going to destroy you.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong> Ack! N-no! Summon...I summon thee! Come forth! Save me!</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong> Help me...!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A summoning circle...! Is he trying to summon something again!?</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong> Ahhh! It&#39;s here... It&#39;s here! Kill them! Kill them all...!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> ...Now what has he summoned this time?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This&#39;s a super giant organism reaction... Could it be...!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Did he manage to summon...a dragon to the 19th century...?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> There&#39;s no need to be surprised.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> The seven eras had stood once under fire. If they are undergoing repairs, it wouldn&#39;t be surprising something like this can happen.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong> Y-yes... I did it! My clan&#39;s ambitions have finally been fulfilled!</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong> Using this dragonkin, I shall bring all of London&#39;s mages under my command!</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong> Now all the Lords of the Clock Tower will be erad\u2014</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The mage...!</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong> Gyaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!!! It&#39;s... IT&#39;S EATING MEEEEEE!!!</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong> Why!? I was the one who summoned it...! Why!? Sto\u2013Gyaaaaaaaaahhhhhh!!!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Pathetic. Only through luck and coincidence did he succeed in his summoning. Without the ability to control his thrall, there is no point summoning it.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Fine. O almighty Phantasmal Beast... Dragonkin!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> My father revered thy name, and deemed thy form perfect for battle!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> And as his son, I have been despised by my enemies, by the people, by history itself... Not as a dragon, but as the devil!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> And now, I shall grapple with thee...a being Father deemed perfection itself. What irony!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> But I am grateful for this evil fortune! It may be twisted, but I will make a most worthy opponent for you!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> I, Vlad III, the son of Dracul...shall sink my fangs into your neck!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Dragonkin...incoming!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Let&#39;s do this!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Indeed! Taste my deadly spear!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Protect the people of the city!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> ...Yes! How like my Master to be conscious of such a thing, even in a situation like this!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> If we were in the right era, you might have made a respectable king.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Now, let&#39;s do this!</p><hr><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> ...Impressive, dragonkin. As a creature that possesses part of my name, you truly were a worthy opponent.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s the opposite, my lord.</p><hr><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> ...Ahem.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> I suppose we&#39;ve managed to improve my name&#39;s ill repute here.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> A mysterious hero who saved London from a dragonkin... Not bad. Not bad at all...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (If it&#39;s mysterious, then no one will know it was him...)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Oh no! A crowd is gathering!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Let&#39;s move out! Master, Vlad...hurry!</p><p><strong>Man:</strong> U-um...</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Hm? What is it?</p><p><strong>Man:</strong> If it&#39;s all right...may I take a photograph with you?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> A photograph? Hm. I&#39;ll allow it. Master. Let&#39;s take it together.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Eh!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Is that... C-can we do that...?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> I&#39;ll allow it.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Even that Saint George\u2013Georgios\u2013has made a hobby of it. That surely means it is not something that would give offense to God.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Master. My collar is not crooked, is it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I-is this okay?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Ha... I have knowledge of the modern world. I know very well that such contraptions don&#39;t steal one&#39;s soul.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Pity it will be monochrome, though...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (I think Vlad is missing the point...)</p><hr><p><strong>Man:</strong> Here we go!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Th-this picture&#39;s not going to be left for future generations, is it...?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Do not worry. Even if it were, nobody would know what kind of photo it was anyway.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> It is destined to turn to dust someday, much like that dragonkin we just defeated.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Let us return to Chaldea, Master. I appreciate you accompanying me on my endless journey to fulfill my desires.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> It may be futile. It may all be in vain. It may be a meaningless and ludicrous journey.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> But such a thing is not to be fought. It is not in my nature to be abashed.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> And. While I savor all of these endeavors...</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> I simply cannot take pride in the fact that I am a vampire. Not ever.</p>',260),a=[n];function g(i,p){return o(),e("div",null,a)}var l=t(r,[["render",g],["__file","Vlad III - Apocrypha.html.vue"]]);export{l as default};
