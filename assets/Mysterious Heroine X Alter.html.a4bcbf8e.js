(So she can sword good because she\u2019s too lazy? I guess it\u2019s something like \u201Clet\u2019s finish quick so I can go home\u201D).</p><p><strong>Invisible Hand of the King: [C]</strong> Dark teachings about how to be an emperor taught by the teacher Master Agravain. While reading the flow of battle, controlling equals from the shadows, the essence is in various wiles trying to bring out their capabilities to the utmost.

The glasses are a necessary item to rest the boosted optical nerve. Vision rather decreases while running.</p><p>The last survivor of the already destroyed and lost dark knights \u201CDark Rounds\u201D. Granted title is Sir Pendragon. An \u201CAnti-Anti-Saber Ultimate Weapon\u201D trained by the \u201CDark Rounds\u201D. Making the Alternium crystals the dark knights went through thick and thin to collect react with the extracted X factors from X, and bumping X into a new Servant, she was a girl who became the center of conspiracies trying to extinguish confrontation. But X\u2019s own work blocked those conspiracies, the Rounds faced too the road to collapse, and the remaining girl \u201CX Alter\u201D disappeared. After that, she became her housemate for a little, while not revealing her identity, developing this into a comical yet heartful school hero drama of about two seasons. And then the disappearance of X\u2015\u2015. The very fulfillment of overthrowing Heroine X, was supposed to help the unspeakable thirst of her soul. The X Alter who lost her worthy opponent, discouraged enough for the dessert after her meal not going through her throat, the turbulent Servant World was \u2015\u2015 and the ikeojis (handsome old men?) of the Rounds turned into Wraiths won\u2019t forgive it. Alter herself is supreme. Alter herself is the precious royal road. Leggings rather than bloomers themselves are fit for a noble throne. Honestly, with the troublesome darkness of her heart, the words of the ikeojis have become like a curse and made a sport of. The contact with the messenger of the Villain Alliance that will appear soon will change her fate greatly once more.</p><h2 id="standard-weapons" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#standard-weapons" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Standard Weapons</h2><p>Wicked Holy Sword Necrocalibur.

My instincts shout to defeat her.</p><p><strong>Artoria Lily</strong> A difficult to deal with opponent. Just looking at her crushes tightly the stomach of my heart but, why do I yearn bean daifuku so much?</p><p><strong>Frankenstein</strong> A fellow from the Servant World, I\u2019m relieved that the atmosphere around Admiral Fraulein Fran hasn\u2019t changed. Because of our mutual consciousness of energy saving and that we communicate with breaths like \u201CAh\u201D \u201CUh\u201D we immediately felt sympathy for each other. Sweet like konpeit\u014D, she feels a bit stinging.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla</strong> The Captain\u2606Nikola in the Servant World, my superior officer so to speak. In terms of villainy, he\u2019s not a bad boss. How to say it? It\u2019s like his head is full of lightning.</p><p><strong>Amazoness CEO</strong> Amazoness dot com is God. Even if you\u2019re 100 light years away, they\u2019ll cut down the life of the employee and deliver it the same day. Same as sandwiching chocolate and grilled marshmallow between crackers, it can be said it\u2019s the deed of a genius that doesn\u2019t know about health.</p><p><strong>Tamamo no Mae</strong> She is involved in something, the strict yet gentle owner of the kotatsu room. When I told her that if I had a mother she\u2019d definitely be like her, she was blown away. Refreshing like June, she wraps fluffily like monaka.</p><p><strong>Voroid \u201CK6-X4\u201D</strong> The exclusive voroid I named \u201CBlack Knight-kun\u201D. For some reason it\u2019s been around me \u2015 since I can remember. Its personality is mean, quite fierce. If it has the chance, it\u2019ll try to rebel against its master.
