I&#39;ve been having trouble waking up for the past few days\u2014Oh.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, you&#39;re here already, Senpai. As a master of REM sleep, I can see you are ready anytime.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Waking up immediately is a special skill I have.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I know. I noticed that when I first met you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I still remember how cheerful you were when you woke up that day. That memory is one of my best to date.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Actually, I pulled an all-nighter...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That is not good. Chaldea time is now the benchmark in this world.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai, staying past 1 in the morning is bad for your body. Even if you get login bonuses at 4.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Mash, I&#39;m glad to see that you&#39;re doing great, too. Well, can I start briefing now?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um...s-sure. Sorry, Doctor.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You were talking about a new Singularity, right? But Doctor, aren&#39;t those coordinates the same as Singularity F?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It does appear that way on Chaldeas&#39; map, but the temporal axis is different.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> This Singularity corresponds to the point 10 years earlier in time than the Singularity F you guys investigated before.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I can&#39;t conclude that this is a Holy Grail for certain, but an extremely similar response has been observed.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Earlier, huh? But is it really possible that a Holy Grail would manifest at the same point so frequently?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Actually, even I can&#39;t explain that. So, I thought I would bring someone who seemed capable of doing it.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> I see. That&#39;s why you called me here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Zhuge Liang... No, Lord El-Melloi II!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Indeed, I am familiar with Fuyuki City in Japan... Or so I&#39;d like to say.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> But unfortunately, my knowledge is estranged from the history recorded by Laplace here in Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> That&#39;s expected. Now that human history has been incinerated,</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> many different possibilities got mixed in with Chaldeas&#39; observation results.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Perhaps, Chaldeas didn&#39;t exist in the history where Mr. El-Melloi II came from.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Your world and our world... I am not sure which one is the proper history, however...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It is obvious that both worlds are \u201Ccentered and extremely close to each other.\u201D Otherwise, you wouldn&#39;t have been summoned.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> You&#39;re talking about the cluster of parallel worlds in the Primary Branch... In other words, Phenomena Permissible for Revision that share the same future despite minor differences...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> And Phenomena Designated for Removal: the cluster of parallel worlds that would eventually lead to ruin like fallen leaves.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Unfortunately, that kind of topic is out of my purview.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> It&#39;s a part of the World that, unless you&#39;re one with a Heroic Spirit like me, is hard to understand.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Besides, it&#39;s not something Fujimaru must hear, either.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> So, I&#39;m going to tell you only what I know. This is all just based on the events that occurred in my world, mind you.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> So. Your records indicate that the first Holy Grail War took place in Fuyuki City of 2004. However...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> As far as I know, the Holy Grail War has occured five times in Fuyuki City.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Five times! That many!?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fooou?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Hm, I see. So depending on the situation, the Holy Grail War already happened five times already.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> \u2014Wait, five times already!? A ritual of that scale was performed five times!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> How did they hide it from everybody!? Don&#39;t tell me the Holy Grail War is a competitive sport in your world,</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> and people treat it like the Olympic Games!?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> A rather amusing idea, but that&#39;s not it, Doctor.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> In our case, the Mage&#39;s Association and the Holy Church colluded to cover everything up.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> O-Of course they did... Whew, that scared me. Please continue, Professor.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> The temporal axis observed this time was not the 2004 where Singularity F was located, but 10 years earlier... The Fourth Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> When it comes to my world, it&#39;s not a surprise that you could detect a Holy Grail in the past at those coordinates.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The possibility that a Holy Grail could exist at that era in the past... Indeed, that would be able to give birth to a new Singularity.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Could this be a misadjustment on Sheba&#39;s part? I mean, to observe the light of civilization in the past...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> I personally hope that&#39;s the case.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Now that human history has been incinerated, it&#39;s impossible to observe light on a normal temporal axis.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> If a light is lit on Chaldeas in its current state, that can only be a Singularity that&#39;s removed from the temporal axis.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Am I right, Doctor?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> This is probably a stain that has already been disconnected from human history and will eventually contaminate it.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Exactly, Professor. No matter what this Singularity actually is, we must retrieve the Holy Grail that exists there.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> I suppose so. Retrieving or destroying it is the mission given to Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> ...However, there is a problem.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> The main reason why the Holy Grail War was repeated five times in Fuyuki was because the Holy Grail never manifested itself, not even once.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Also, due to a certain accident, this ritual has been mutated to a state you can barely call it \u201Critual\u201D anymore.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> In conclusion, you mustn&#39;t retrieve this Holy Grail. It is a Holy Grail that must not manifest... It&#39;s just a poison.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> While it tempted the participants as a \u201Cwish granting device,\u201D in truth, it was merely a device of mass destruction created for the purpose to eliminating the world.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You are really knowledgeable.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Of course, I did my research. Besides, it&#39;s my responsibility as a participant... No, I just want to reassure myself.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> I put in a considerate amount of effort to dismantle Fuyuki&#39;s Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> When it comes to the circumstances surrounding this land, I&#39;ve left no stone unturned.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> How dependable. From the way you sounded, I guess I don&#39;t have to ask you to help us, right?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Doctor, you sure are a bad guy. You called me here because you wanted me to help, no?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> I will join this investigation. I believe I am the best observer, don&#39;t you think so?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;ll be a great help.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes! It&#39;ll be very assuring to have all the information about our destination.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You say that, but you really want to go, right?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> I won&#39;t deny that. The Fourth Holy Grail War is a fateful event to me in no small way.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> And it&#39;s about to begin right now. I&#39;d be lying if I said that I had no interest.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Then it&#39;s settled. Get ready for Rayshift now.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The target coordinates are Fuyuki City, Japan, 1994. Looks like it&#39;s gonna be different this time around, too. So watch out!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fooou!</p><h2 id="act-1-the-man-who-knows-fuyuki" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#act-1-the-man-who-knows-fuyuki" aria-hidden="true">#</a> ACT-1: &quot;The Man Who Knows Fuyuki&quot;</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So this is...Fuyuki before it was in flames?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fou!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Looks peaceful.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. Seeing how vibrant this city is... Somehow I feel very relieved.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Is it rare for you?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh no. I&#39;ve seen the scenery of modern Japan during the incident of Ogawa-heim already. There&#39;s not much difference.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But to think in 10 years, catastrophe would visit a quiet town like this...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> You shouldn&#39;t be too sentimental. We exist in a world where everything&#39;s been incinerated, not just this town.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Y-You are right... But...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> My apologies, I could&#39;ve worded it better. Yes, normal life is hard to come by, but don&#39;t get obsessed over it.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Fearing the inevitable tragedy like the catastrophe of war would only slow you down.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Because we fight as we are confronted with the destruction of mankind&#39;s past and future.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> What I meant was, we should keep that in mind, and prepare ourselves for any situation.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Take this instance for example. You probably think there won&#39;t be any threat in a peaceful residential district at a time where everybody is asleep, correct?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s right. To be honest, I find it hard to believe this place was the site for a Holy Grail War...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> That perception is too naive. In a fight between mages, first you must question everything you see. For example...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Qi Men Dun Jia, Eight Gates Golden Locks Formation!</p><p><strong>Assassin:</strong> Ugh!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> !?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Bfoooou!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Assassin Servant!? Was that Presence Concealment!? But even so that was way too concealed!</p><p><strong>Assassin:</strong> D-Damn you! How is that possible!?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Are you asking how is it possible for me to see through your Presence Concealment? Well, I couldn&#39;t.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> However, I do know from my investigation that the Assassin in the Fourth Holy Grail War could split into multiple entities and monitored the entirety of Fuyuki.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> I knew we&#39;d get caught in your surveillance network seeing how flashy Rayshifts can be. Then it&#39;s only natural for you to come scouting.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Now that you&#39;re in my Stone Sentinel Maze, there&#39;s no point in you using Presence Concealment.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Now, Fujimaru, it&#39;s time to put up a fight. I&#39;ll explain everything later.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Enemy Servant eliminated. The battle is over.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That was a pretty easy win.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That was pretty weak for a Servant...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> That was just one of the many Assassins. As you&#39;ve seen, that Assassin has the ability to split and manifest multiple bodies.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> That&#39;s why the fight is not over yet. We must prepare for the next encounter.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Do you mean a single Heroic Spirit has the ability to manifest as a group?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Not only is it a fearsome ability to use in espionage, unless one has an Anti-Army Noble Phantasm, it means that Assassin can overwhelm any opponent with sheer numbers alone.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Humph, but now that I&#39;ve mastered Qi Men Dun Jia, they&#39;ll just end up as my prey.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> They&#39;d have to keep the entire Fuyuki area under surveillance for the time being. That said, they can&#39;t exactly ignore us either.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Assassin will most likely keep sending people to attack us.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> As a result, they have broken the golden rule of military strategy by continuously investing their combat personnel without reserve. How very sad, indeed.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> We&#39;ll have to fight them one after another, but they shouldn&#39;t pose too much of a threat.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Just take them out the minute you lay eyes on them. Now then, there&#39;s no time to waste. Onward I say! Onward!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh? But...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Aren&#39;t you going to give us an explanation now?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What the heck is even going on right now?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Apologies, but it will have to wait. I&#39;m not trying to be pompous, it&#39;s just we&#39;re in a race against time.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Oh, don&#39;t make that face. I&#39;ll explain as many things as I can on our way, starting with the most vital matters.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fooou...</p><h2 id="act-2-military-intervention" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#act-2-military-intervention" aria-hidden="true">#</a> ACT-2: &quot;Military Intervention&quot;</h2><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> To be honest, the Holy Grail War in Fuyuki is basically a scam.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> The whole \u201Cbattle royale for the chance to grant your wish\u201D format is just an outright lie to lure in participants.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A lie? That&#39;s terrible... Tricking someone by telling them their wishes will be granted... That&#39;s criminal!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> It absolutely is. If these Holy Grail Wars were a widespread thing in a different world, I bet there&#39;d be a lot of lawsuits being filed over them.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> That being said, in this world...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> That is, in my world, that didn&#39;t happen. That&#39;s because Holy Grail Wars only took place here.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> It was an insidious trap. One that, with the defeat of each participating Servant, means an unprecedented disaster draws closer.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> When the required number of summoned Servant have been sacrificed, \u201CAll the Evils of the World\u201D A\u014Bra Mainiiu will activate.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> All the Evils of the World?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That&#39;s a pretty dangerous-sounding name.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> You don&#39;t need to know everything. Just consider it something like a bomb that could destroy the world.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> It has more than enough power to wipe out the entirety of human history up to that point.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Singularity F, the first foundation you all have restored...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> I see that as the likely state of Fuyuki after the conclusion of the Fifth Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> The first point to fall as the world crumbled. All because a ritual that should have never been carried out was indeed completed.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But why would someone set a trap like that? Who would do that?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> This ritual started off with a very different purpose, and became what it is through a ridiculous man-made disaster.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> That disaster is a \u201Cpast event\u201D even in this timeline.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> At any rate, the problem is that the paradox Sheba detected in this era is like a Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I see, if the Holy Grail is already here...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Yes. If the Holy Grail has already manifested, this city should be in flames right now. But at a glance, that&#39;s not really the case.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> So the Holy Grail detected by Chaldea is likely something different from Fuyuki&#39;s Greater Grail, corrupted by A\u014Bra Mainiiu.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> If I recall, this Fourth Holy Grail War is still in its early stages now. Tonight is when everything moves into motion. We can use that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ah, I see. So that&#39;s why you&#39;ve been so conscious of the time today.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> That&#39;s right. Right now, it&#39;s critical that we stay ahead of events. This harbor district will be the key.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What&#39;s going to happen here?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Hmm, it seems we have to end our chitchat before I get to explain that. The events have caught up to us.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> You there. May I ask who you are?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> It seems you are also participants in the Holy Grail War... Seeing how you have Servants with you.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1ASaber:</strong> Irisviel, something is strange. I no longer detect the presence of Lancer, who invited us here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Is that... Saber?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> She appears to be, but that&#39;s not her. I mean, she&#39;s contracted with another Master already!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Is this another Heroine X incident?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Let&#39;s not go there for now, Senpai. This time, we&#39;re being serious here...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> That is one of the seven Heroic Spirits summoned into the Fourth Holy Grail War. Class Saber, Altria Pendragon.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> That being the case, sorry, but we will be your opponent now instead of Lancer.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Irisviel von Einzbern.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> What... You! How do you know my True Name!?</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> This is no ordinary opponent. Be careful, Saber!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Okay, Fujimaru, time for Round 2. But this opponent is quite powerful. She&#39;s on an entirely different level from Assassin.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> I realize I&#39;m shoving you into a rather difficult fight, but unfortunately, I need to put one more restriction on you.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> ...I&#39;m sorry, but don&#39;t defeat Saber here. Only push far enough to make her retreat.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s a tall order!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> And how do you propose we do that?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> I already told you we&#39;re pressed for time. I&#39;ll explain everything later. Now, go on and do your best!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fooou!?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The enemy Saber has withdrawn from battle!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> We don&#39;t need to go after her?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Leave her be. The next one is who we should go after.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The next...one?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> I&#39;ve been keeping the Servant who was supposed to fight Saber in my Qi Men Dun Jia formation. But it&#39;s about time...</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong> Who are you? Was that strange stone maze your doing!? What happened to Saber!?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Something really came out!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Calm yourself, First Spear of the Knights of Fianna. We&#39;re not Archibald&#39;s enemies.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong> What!? You know my True Name...</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> Humph. We seem to be faced with a formidable opponent. How did you know that I was Lancer&#39;s Master?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ? Where is that voice coming from?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> He&#39;s shielding himself with magecraft. This Servant&#39;s Master is hiding somewhere close by.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Lord Kayneth, we have hastened to join your side and stand in support of you.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> For certain reasons, I cannot divulge my name, so let me give the name of Lady Reines as my guarantor for the time being.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> Reines... My niece? I demand to know what is going on here!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Though I would not hesitate to provide an explanation at the present time, I would beg your forbearance until tomorrow.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> However, allow me to say just one thing in advance: I can tell you the current location of Caster.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> Caster? How do you know that?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Tomorrow at noon, I will prove the truth of my words.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> I will show you anew what value lies in listening to our story.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> Humph...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Then, we will pay a visit to your penthouse suite in Fuyuki New Tower at 10 p.m. tomorrow night. So for tonight, will you allow us to go?</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> Ohh? So you even know my address, do you? ...Very well. I don&#39;t dislike a smart man like yourself.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> All the more if you&#39;re a mage with a sense of gratitude. But that faint trace of a working-class accent in your English... What a shame.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> But, very well. I shall accept your proposal.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> Having observed how you handled Saber earlier, we will depart here in peace.</p><p><strong>Kayneth:</strong> I will neither flee nor hide myself. I look forward to hearing just what it is you&#39;re planning.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s... Lancer&#39;s Master?</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong> Are you certain about this, Master?</p><p><strong>Kayneth:</strong> Patience, Lancer. Yes, they are clearly a suspicious bunch. But when you know so little about what you face, it&#39;s best to wait and observe.</p><p><strong>Kayneth:</strong> Best to be cautious when starting a fight, got it?</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong> ...Understood.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Then we&#39;ll be taking our leave. Come, let&#39;s get going, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Now then, we can finally take a moment to talk properly. How far did I get in my explanation earlier?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You said that once this war ends, the world will be destroyed...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Ah yes, that&#39;s right. Defeated Servants are absorbed into the Greater Grail of Fuyuki as sacrifices to bring it to completion.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> But what happens then is not the granting of a wish, but the release of A\u014Bra Mainiiu... From the start, this war was never meant to have a winner.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> What a cruel tale...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> After investing so much of yourself and even murdering fellow mages, your reward is the opposite of what you would wish... That&#39;s truly cruel...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> It certainly is. I imagine if I&#39;d been the winner of the Fifth Holy Grail War, I would have turned evil from despair.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Forgive me. And to think I&#39;m the one who&#39;s always saying sentimentality is pointless.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> In my experience, the Greater Grail activates in a limited capacity after the defeat of the fifth Servant.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> However, that also means that if we can convince at least three Servants to withdraw from the battlefield intact...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Then the ritual will end up eternally in limbo, the Holy Grail will remain incomplete, and we can simply secure its vessel. Right?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fooou.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Understood. So this time, we won&#39;t be fighting to defeat the other Servants, but to protect them, in a sense.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Though it&#39;d be best if we could resolve all this amicably.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Right. But we can&#39;t assume everyone will agree peacefully.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Since we want the War to end in a stalemate, we need to first seek out and defeat the Servants with whom such an agreement is impossible.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Just when I thought you were a gentleman!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Just when I thought reason would triumph!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> I&#39;m aware of my own savagery. Let me say right now that I started off as a cowardly, subservient boy.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> But the war strategist I housed in my body gets so worked up I couldn&#39;t help but change.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> He is THE Zhuge Liang.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Truly. Strategists in Ancient China can get even more violent and ruthless than military generals.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Sayest thou truly?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> What kind of foolishness is that?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> It&#39;s one thing if theater actors or poets use that language, but why would you talk like that? Are you making fun of them?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Show some respect!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fofofooou...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Now, back to our conversation.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Of the participants in this Holy Grail War, there are two Servants we couldn&#39;t even try to spare... Caster and Archer.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Without a shred of doubt, I can say those two would be incapable of reaching an understanding with us.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> So it&#39;d be best to get them out of the way before they start engaging other Servants.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> That brings us to Assassin. Their Master is colluding with the one in possession of Archer.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Since we plan to fight Archer, we&#39;ll inevitably have to fight Assassin too. Though they&#39;ve already marked us as opponents anyway.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, the one we fought right after we Rayshifted here...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Next, we have Berserker... Since his madness prevents us from reasoning with him directly, everything depends on his Master.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> The key will be whether we can convince the Master while he&#39;s still able to keep full control over Berserker without having to use Command Spells.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> That said, there&#39;s always the possibility Berserker could go on a rampage himself, independent of his Master&#39;s will.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> One vital thing I learned after the Fourth War ended is that the one who&#39;d summoned Berserker was in an extremely unstable condition, both physically and mentally.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> But I never did get to meet him myself...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Well then, shall we put dealing with Berserker on hold for now?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Though I can&#39;t help but feel it is risky, yes.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Therefore, by process of elimination, we can conclude that our best chances for success lie with Saber, Lancer, and Rider.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Ahh, so that&#39;s why you prevented that clash on the docks between Saber and Lancer.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Then that only leaves Rider&#39;s faction. Do you think they&#39;d be likely to cooperate?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Why are you falling quiet all of a sudden?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Is there something worrying you?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> ...Yes.

With how I am now, I can tell the structure of this spell is very solid.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What should we do? At this rate we won&#39;t be able to get supplies from Chaldea.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> We&#39;ve got no choice but to destroy the keystones the mage placed, and take the Leyline for ourselves.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> They should be fairly well-defended, but we&#39;ll have to break through.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> I&#39;d like to avoid unnecessary combat, because we can&#39;t fight on an empty stomach. Nothing for it.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> You mean destroy the barrier keystones!? If you do that, won&#39;t the mage, the Second Owner, get mad?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Of course. But the family that owns this land, the Tohsakas, are also the mages that summoned Archer.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> In other words, they&#39;re our enemies to begin with.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...I see. But the keystone to the Leylines should be carefully hidden, right?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Don&#39;t worry. I know where they are already.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What? How did you find out?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> The next heir to the Tohsaka clan is a student of mine. In the end, I dismantle the Greater Grail here with her help.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> When that happens, I learn the structure of the Leylines in this area.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Wait a second. You&#39;re going to wreck your future student&#39;s estate?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> This future happens in a different timeline. I have no duty or responsibility to the Tohsakas in this era.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> And the Tohsaka family was one of the clans responsible for the Fuyuki Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> If they lose their Leyline and become impoverished, it&#39;s their own fault. I&#39;m sure the future Tohsaka will understand.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> She&#39;s not around to agree, though!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...Someday we might end up paying for this big time...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Let&#39;s start with the nearest point.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> After we destroy several of the keystones, we can try setting up the circle again.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Is this okay?

Your statements about Caster last night...</p><p><strong>Kayneth:</strong> Why were you able to know the Holy Church&#39;s actions in advance?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Because for me, it happened long ago in the past.</p><p><strong>Kayneth:</strong> What?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> The morning after the Servant battle at the wharf, the Overseer speaks to all participants and offers a special reward for the first to kill Caster.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> ...But that&#39;s not all I know.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> You originally intended to summon Iskandar for this battle. You even had the catalyst for it.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> However, it was stolen by a student at the Clock Tower, Waver Velvet...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> ...and you were forced to summon Diarmuid Ua Duibhne instead.</p><p><strong>Kayneth:</strong> How did you...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> And it&#39;s not you that&#39;s providing the magical energy for that Servant, it&#39;s your fianc\xE9e Sola-Ui Nuada-Re Sophia-Ri.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> You have her in another room to keep her safe. Well, it&#39;s good to be careful.</p><p><strong>Kayneth:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Oh, speaking of Lady Sola-Ui.

I&#39;d heard rumors that the Atlas Institute was working on such a thing, but...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Yes. All of these great achievements in magecraft are accomplished by the Archibald family.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (Whaaaaat!?)</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> (You there, don&#39;t let it show on your face!)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (Remember, poker face, Senpai!)</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> (Fou fou fou...)</p><p><strong>Kayneth:</strong> So in the future, the Archibald family achieves all this?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Of course, this is only possible due to your astonishing leadership.

Hehe. I&#39;ve dedicated my whole life to magecraft, so I don&#39;t know if I could be a family man...</p><p><strong>Kayneth:</strong> At least, I didn&#39;t until now! I see!

You know exactly which of us is in the right!</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> Maybe, but he is my Master.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> If you want to pick a fight with him, as his Servant, that means you&#39;ll have to fight me.</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong> Rider, you...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Tch... That&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um, Lord? I thought the plan was to not fight Rider?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Let&#39;s retreat, Fujimaru. There&#39;s no sense in fighting here.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> Humph. How boring. And I thought you had a little more spine.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong> Hah! So you&#39;re gonna say all that, and then turn tail and run? What a wimp!</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> Hey, don&#39;t get cocky.</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong> GWAH!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> He sent that kid flying with the flick of a finger!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What a fickle creature...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Gaah! This is pissing me off! A Servant shouldn&#39;t be getting involved in his Master&#39;s fights! Are you a helicopter parent or something?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Calm down, Professor.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> No, I think they&#39;re supposed to do that...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> But we were lucky enough to run into our third target to protect, the Rider Servant...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Was it okay for things to fall apart like that?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> I don&#39;t care! They don&#39;t plan on seriously fighting anyway.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Ignore them, they&#39;ll just sit in their hideout to eat rice crackers and watch videos all day!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I don&#39;t know...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Looks like Rider is a touchy subject for Lord El-Melloi, Senpai.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s a problem.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> We&#39;ll have to deal with it ourselves.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I think so too, yes.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fooou.</p><h2 id="act-9-the-king-of-knights-returns" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#act-9-the-king-of-knights-returns" aria-hidden="true">#</a> ACT-9: The King of Knights Returns&quot;</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The summoning circle&#39;s complete.

Hahahah. It&#39;ll be a good practice lesson.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;re a tough teacher, huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Isn&#39;t that kind of mean?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Not at all.

No point in talking about that now, though.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Um, I&#39;m sorry to interrupt your break, but...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...You have a visitor. One approaching Servant. Looks like a Saber.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Saber... Altria Pendragon, the one we saw at the wharf?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Probably. Hmm... I guess we exposed ourselves too much.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> We made it very obvious that we&#39;re an enemy. It&#39;s inevitable that they&#39;d retaliate.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Servant, Saber-class. Once again, I challenge you. Let&#39;s have a fair fight.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> A fair fight, huh? Humph. I know exactly what you&#39;re up to.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> For this Holy Grail War, the Einzberns are using their Servant as a decoy, while a hired assassin strikes from the shadows.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> What?

But it would hurt us to leave this circle we just established.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> We have the high ground, Fujimaru. We&#39;ll draw out the battle until they decide to leave.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Got it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> We&#39;ll go with that plan.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> And Mash, in this battle keep an eye out for ambushes on your Master.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> I&#39;ll use my Qi Men Dun Jia to support you.

I have plenty of magical energy stored up!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Hmm, they&#39;re hanging in there longer than I thought. This is going to be rough...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh!? Watch out!</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> What?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> I knew it! An ambush! But that attack...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, it wasn&#39;t targeted at Senpai. It was for Saber&#39;s Master.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> They&#39;re not working with the Einzberns? So they&#39;re someone else entirely?</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong> Spells that control the terrain make it so I can&#39;t hide, huh? This is tough to work with.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s... the Servant who killed Caster&#39;s Master!?</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> It&#39;s an Assassin. Are they after both of us?</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong> No, I&#39;m only interested in one target. You, bearer of the Grail.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> ...What?</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong> It&#39;s not that you&#39;ve done anything wrong. Taking your life is simply the quickest route to dismantling the Grail.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> I won&#39;t let you!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Saber and Assassin have begun combat.

Stop getting in my way! You&#39;re not part of the Holy Grail War, are you?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Neither are you, it seems. What are you after? Why are you trying to kill the Einzbern Master?</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong> ...There&#39;s no point in explaining it.</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong> I am commanded from beyond the bounds of human understanding. I cannot coexist with those trapped by ethics.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Assassin has retreated. ...Shall we follow?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> No. Let&#39;s avoid any other battles. Overexerting ourselves just makes us a target for other enemies.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fooou.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> I&#39;d like to suggest to Einzbern that she put away her weapon for the day.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> You have more threats to worry about than just us.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> ...Very well. You did save us.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> You may not believe me, but we don&#39;t intend to make enemies of the Einzbern clan.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> We couldn&#39;t help what happened on the wharf.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> In fact, I&#39;d imagine Saber there found it strange that we didn&#39;t pursue her.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> ...That&#39;s right, Irisviel. There&#39;s something strange about the way they fight.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> I don&#39;t know why, but there&#39;s a meekness, as if they&#39;re trying to keep themselves from winning.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> I&#39;ll make this simple. Are you our enemies, or our friends?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Our goal does not involve the battle for the Grail, and to achieve that, we need your Saber to be kept safe.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> That&#39;s all I can say for now while still telling you the truth.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> ...Very well. As long as you don&#39;t make yourselves obvious enemies of the Einzberns, we&#39;ll leave you alone.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> We have lots of other enemies that we need to prioritize first.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Let me ask you something. Do you know who that Assassin was?</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> Not really. He was saying something strange. That neither of you were participants in the Holy Grail War...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> That Assassin&#39;s presence is clearly an irregularity.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Not that we&#39;re one to talk, in that respect. Our immediate goal is to solve the mystery of his identity.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> The mystery, huh? He did seem strange, yes.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> What do you mean?</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> I&#39;ve never met him, but for some reason...he seems like someone I&#39;m deeply related to.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> Like he was here only to kill me, and I was only here to be killed by him...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> That can&#39;t be true!</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> It felt like we existed only to destroy and be destroyed.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> The intuition of a homunculus, the crowning achievement of the Einzberns&#39; most secret techniques, cannot be easily dismissed.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> ...Fated to kill each other... No. No, Irisviel. That&#39;s not true.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> I will protect you with my blade. You are here on this battlefield to be victorious.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> Yes, you&#39;re right. With a Servant like you at my side, I have nothing to fear at all.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> One last thing, Heroic Spirit with the shield. Your support was wonderful. Thank you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No, um...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> ...(That thing that looks like a shield...

But what about Lancer... What about Lord Archibald?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> He&#39;s still enemies with Saber over the Grail, right?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> That&#39;s the problem. There&#39;s a limit to what you can do when you&#39;re trying to be friends with both sides.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Hmm... Seems like we&#39;ll need to come up with another plan.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Do you have some way to persuade him?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> If you want to convince someone of something, the fastest way is to present them with an illusion they want to hear.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> As Lord Kayneth thinks that the world revolves around him...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> ...he&#39;s likely to believe anything that reinforces that. A true strategist can control people&#39;s minds with ease.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Foufoufou!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Zhuge Liang, that&#39;s a con man, not a strategist.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> But first... We need to deal with this Shadow that refuses to leave us alone.</p><p><strong>Assassin:</strong> GWACH! You found me again\u2013!?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> The Stone Sentinel Maze is perfect for keeping out Assassins. It&#39;s like having your own portable workshop.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> You fell into my clutches the second you tried to sneak up on me!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Enemy Servant eliminated... But is this another fragment?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Even if they&#39;re not tough individually, it&#39;s hard to deal with so many of them.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Let&#39;s just meet up with Lord Kayneth before anyone else follows us.</p><p><strong>Kayneth:</strong> Just like you suggested, I sent a familiar to the Matou mansion last night and negotiated with them. Berserker will join our battle,</p><p><strong>Kayneth:</strong> with the condition that we provide for them an opportunity to face the Tohsaka clan&#39;s Servant.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Thank you very much. But I&#39;m not certain that it justified the trouble you went through...</p><p><strong>Kayneth:</strong> What? What do you mean?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> There&#39;s been a major development on our side. A decisive improvement, you could say.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> We were able to observe several factors that were still uncertain, allowing us to share much more information with you while still avoiding paradoxes.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> As a result... We can now tell you the entire truth. The whole truth about the Fuyuki Grail War.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> (Fo?)</p><p><strong>Kayneth:</strong> W-What do you mean?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Didn&#39;t you find it strange to begin with?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Why would a huge ceremony involving a battle for an omnipotent wish granter take place in the middle of nowhere, so far from the Clock Tower?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> And then there&#39;s the fact that out of seven participants, only one slot was provided for the Mage&#39;s Association.</p><p><strong>Kayneth:</strong> Yes, well... that&#39;s why I participated. Even if it didn&#39;t live up to its reputation, it was still a fun game with little risk.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> It&#39;s worse than simply not living up to its reputation. The whole Fuyuki Grail War is a fake.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (Whaaaat?)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (Hello!?)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (Senpai, you&#39;re letting it show! Keep a poker face!)</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> This is all a conspiracy by an enemy of the Archibald family, the Trambelios.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> The plan was to get you away from the Clock Tower for a period of time,</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> and then while you were away, quickly expand their influence in the Mage&#39;s Association!</p><p><strong>Kayneth:</strong> W-What!?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> We knew that you would fall for this Trambelio trap, and decided to intervene in the past.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> But we couldn&#39;t warn you about it in advance. In order to share knowledge of the future...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> We needed to observe unshakable evidence in the past that a conspiracy existed.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> (Wow... How does he come up with this stuff...?)</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> (...Fou.)</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Last night we found that proof. We have direct testimony from the Tohsakas, one of the three clans behind the Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Kayneth:</strong> H-How did you get it?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> We destroyed every Leyline we could find in this city.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Of course, this destruction had nothing to do with the Grail War, but that&#39;s why the Tohsakas gave in.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> They didn&#39;t want to lose the rights to their land over a fake Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> The Tohsakas confessed to colluding with the Trambelios in order to lure you out with a fake fourth Grail War.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (What makes it worse is that he&#39;s mixing in truth with the lies...)</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> They knew you wanted glory not as a researcher, but as a warrior, and created the perfect arena to lure you out...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> That&#39;s the true nature of the Fuyuki ritual. The other participants, the Holy Church&#39;s Overseer...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> They&#39;re all decoys to make the farce more believable.</p><p><strong>Kayneth:</strong> How intricate! How wicked!</p><p><strong>Kayneth:</strong> ...But those Trambelios, those fools that espouse \u201Cdemocracy\u201D so much, might just do something like that!</p><p><strong>Kayneth:</strong> Why... Why have I wasted so much of my valuable time on this!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (Welp... He fell for it. Yeah.)</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> But it wasn&#39;t a total loss. Your defeat of Caster was truly impressive.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> I think that display of boldness may have only increased Lady Sola-Ui&#39;s love for you.</p><p><strong>Kayneth:</strong> Y-You think so? Hmm...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> I&#39;m sure of it. I am a man who&#39;s very sensitive to how women feel in that regard. I believe it was\u2014</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> \u201CI was never interested in him before, but now that I&#39;ve seen how brave he is, I&#39;ve gone from hating him to loving him!\u201D</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> It was a change of that magnitude, I believe.</p><p><strong>Kayneth:</strong> Oh, my! Wait, what was that one part? Well, whatever. It all worked out in the end!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> (Oh... I&#39;m starting to kind of feel bad for him...)</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> But still, there is no time to waste. You must hurry to London, and stop the Trambelio plot!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> No matter how secure the Archibald family is, without you they&#39;re no match for the wicked plots of the populists.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> The aristocracy\u2014 The feat of our very clan depends on this!</p><p><strong>Kayneth:</strong> Curse those sneaky Trambelios! Curse you, Valuayeta!</p><p><strong>Kayneth:</strong> I&#39;ll show you a thing or two! Sola-Ui! Hurry and get ready!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> (Fooou...)</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> Our new battle lies beyond the sea... Master, I, Diarmuid, shall accompany you!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> I never had a wish for the Grail to begin with. My spear shall accompany you, no matter the battle!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Oh, excellent. I&#39;m sure that if you have a Servant at your side, Lady Sola-Ui will be very happy.</p><p><strong>Kayneth:</strong> ...Uh...hmm...</p><p><strong>Kayneth:</strong> Lancer, by my Command Spell, I order you. Stay here and continue the Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> W-What!?</p><p><strong>Kayneth:</strong> Farce or not, now that I&#39;ve entered the battle, I must win it in order to maintain my reputation.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Amazing, Lord El-Melloi! You know exactly how important the Archibald reputation is!</p><p><strong>Kayneth:</strong> I leave you my Servant as a present. You may represent the clan in my stead.</p><p><strong>Kayneth:</strong> Defeat everyone involved in this stupid farce, and show them who is truly strong.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Leave it to me!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> ...Very well. If you say so, Master. I shall do my best with my new Master.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> (This is awful! I&#39;ve never seen someone get a Servant contract just by making stuff up!)</p><p><strong>Kayneth:</strong> ...Oh, one last thing. You said you saw a draft of a love letter in my study, right?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> ...? Yes. What of it?</p><p><strong>Kayneth:</strong> I would never allow someone to search my room while there was something so foolish still in it.</p><p><strong>Kayneth:</strong> Am I wrong in thinking that the study you refer to...is one whose master never returned to it?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> ...Yes. That&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Kayneth:</strong> Humph. I suppose in that regard, I should thank you.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> ...Your words honor me, my old Master. You are the Lord I wished to be. You are the great El-Melloi.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Your talents are the greatest treasure the Clock Tower has. Please, take care of yourself.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Lord El-Melloi... I guess here I&#39;ll call you Lord El-Melloi II, but...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> What is it?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;m likely wasting my time here, but all those lies you told your predecessor...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> You&#39;re aware of how false they really are, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What do you mean, Doctor?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Chaldea isn&#39;t a time machine. And you guys aren&#39;t there from the future.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> This Singularity is just a tiny little area. A bubble appearing on the ashes of human history.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Once the irregularity that created the bubble is gone...it will be like a dream that has nothing to do with real history.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Thus, no matter how hard you work, you can&#39;t actually change history.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Even if you save someone here, that salvation is only temporary.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> In the timeline you&#39;re from, the dead will remain dead, and the tragedy will remain a tragedy.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It&#39;s theoretically impossible to change the past via a Rayshift. Everything you&#39;re doing...is meaningless.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fooou...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> And why does that matter, Doctor?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I just wanted to make sure that you personally knew that nothing would come of this.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It seems to me like you&#39;re trying to get through this as peacefully and smoothly as possible.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> But you don&#39;t need to. There are simpler and easier ways, aren&#39;t there?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Nothing will come of it, huh? ...Maybe that&#39;s how it looks to you. But to me, this has a lot of meaning.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Even if I can&#39;t really save them, I wanted to do the best I could here.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> This isn&#39;t atonement for the past. My heart refused to let me\u2014</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> \u2014be weak enough to make the same mistake twice. That&#39;s all.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> You&#39;re free to laugh at me if you like.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> I just don&#39;t want to be forced to realize my own powerlessness again.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Of course, the pain of regret is mine alone. It means nothing to anyone else.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> In that regard, I do feel bad for wasting Fujimaru and Mash&#39;s time, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I don&#39;t mind.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It&#39;s not a waste.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You&#39;re right.

By the way, what is this forest? It&#39;s far away from Fuyuki&#39;s city limits.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> This is an area the Einzberns set aside for the Holy Grail War. Of course, it has a powerful barrier.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fou!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Wait, is it okay for us to just walk straight into a dangerous place like that?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> It&#39;s not a problem. Rider destroyed all the alarms and defensive traps. There&#39;s no reason to worry.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Sounds like things are getting rough. What&#39;s going on inside there?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Heh. Listen to this.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> They&#39;re just having a drinking party.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> They&#39;re really drinking, Senpai!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What is Rider wearing... Also, is that a barrel?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> And what&#39;s that cup-like thing with the long handle?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> ...Fou?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Hmm, I can&#39;t see what&#39;s going on since it&#39;s just audio, but it sounds like something unbelievable.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> Oh?

Your insolence warrants death!</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> If they&#39;re here to ruin our banquet, doesn&#39;t that mean that we&#39;d all fight them together?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> No. Those who violate my laws must be judged by my wrath. I am the King of Heroes, and none may stand against me.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> I see. So you&#39;re laying down the law as a king, then? Then there&#39;s no reason for me to get involved.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> Saber and her Master have no problem with that, I assume?</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> I&#39;d like to ask them to take it somewhere else... But as long as they aren&#39;t attacking us, we&#39;ve no reason to intervene.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Excellent! Then the terms for the battle are laid down! Berserker&#39;s only foe here is Archer.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> We will intervene in the fight and take down Archer! Fujimaru, your orders!</p><p><strong>Matou Kariya:</strong> Kill him!

I&#39;m joining forces with the mad warrior.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> W-What!?</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong> Where is this coming from? What&#39;s the point of siding with him?</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> Well, there isn&#39;t one, probably.</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong> Then why? Just ignore him!</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> I&#39;m not choosing who to side with. I&#39;m choosing who to fight.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> The King of Heroes was my main target, and he&#39;s gone. So I was deciding who to fight next.</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong> Then you want to fight Saber next?</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> Nope. That gloomy-looking strategist with the furrowed brow. He&#39;s my enemy.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> ...Why fight me? You don&#39;t stand to gain anything!</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> No, not really.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> I&#39;ve done everything I possibly could to avoid a conflict with you!

Why do you always stop making sense whenever something important happens!?</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> What doesn&#39;t make sense here is that strategist. He doesn&#39;t make sense at all.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> He&#39;s some kind of strange Servant, neither human nor Heroic Spirit. And his predictions are so accurate it&#39;s scary...</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> He clearly exists outside the rules of this battle. And yet he&#39;s obviously trying to intervene.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> The one thing I can say for sure...is that he&#39;s here to interfere with the Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> I don&#39;t know what he&#39;s after, but I&#39;m one of the Servants summoned for the battle.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> Someone who&#39;s trying to destroy the battle itself is a far greater threat than a mere enemy, right?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> Saber, Lancer, if you want to work with him, you&#39;re my enemy.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> And thus, I&#39;ll side with Berserker.

What will you do? Will you follow?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> ...Leave. There&#39;s nothing we can do.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> Excellent.

Okay?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Hmm? Hold on a second. I&#39;m getting a magical energy signature approaching you. Its strength indicates it&#39;s a Servant.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It&#39;s different from any remaining Assassin fragments, and also from Rider and Berserker who retreated earlier.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That means...the figures don&#39;t add up, right?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Yeah. There are only seven Heroic Spirits that the Fuyuki Holy Grail can call forth. Meaning it&#39;s an irregular like us. It&#39;s him.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> You mean he&#39;s going after Irisviel again?</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong> I look away for one second and you&#39;ve got even more friends, huh? You guys are such a pain.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Now that you&#39;ve been caught twice by the Eight Gates Golden Locks Formation, you realize it&#39;s pointless to hide your presence?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> But how condescending of you to just walk straight up to us.</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong> Well, I&#39;ll never get anywhere just waiting for my chance.</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong> The Holy Grail War is nearing its end, and before its conclusion, I must have that homunculus destroyed.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> So you&#39;re after the vessel of the Holy Grail after all. It seems like our goals are similar, but our methodology is different.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> The vessel of the Holy Grail?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Yes. She&#39;s pretending to be Saber&#39;s Master, but...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> She is serving a different purpose. She collects the souls of fallen Heroic Spirits... A Lesser Grail, the key that opens the Greater Grail.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Like giving an autonomous personality to ceremonial equipment.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> You&#39;re quite knowledgeable. But I don&#39;t really like you saying I&#39;m pretending to be a Master. Am I not a proper Master? Is that what you want to say?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> There&#39;s no reason to hide anything this late in the game, homunculus.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Irisviel is being used as bait. I know the true Master is hiding in the shadows.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> What do you mean? Irisviel is my Master, totally and completely. I am not contracted to anyone else...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> What?</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> Will you see this and still doubt?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Command Spells!? Then you really did contract with Saber?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Lord El-Melloi, this is no time to be surprised! The enemy Servant is coming at us!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong> Tch, giving me a hard time...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Hold on. Fighting any more isn&#39;t going to get us anywhere. There&#39;s nothing for either of us to gain.</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong> Either of us to gain? It&#39;s almost like you completely understand what&#39;s going on with me.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> You have nothing going on, personally. You&#39;re a Servant without a Master.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> You&#39;re not fighting to benefit anyone at all.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> No Master? Then what about the contract? How is he getting supplied with magical energy?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Of course, a Servant can only materialize in this world when there&#39;s a summoning and a contract.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> However, in his case, the contract wasn&#39;t made with a human. ...Isn&#39;t that right, envoy of the Counter Force?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The Counter Force?! Then this Heroic Spirit has contracted with the World itself!?</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong> ...How did you come to that conclusion?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> We&#39;re not part of this temporal axis, and thus have a bird&#39;s-eye view of the situation here.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> We know that the end of the Holy Grail War here in Fuyuki will lead to the end of the world.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> What was that? What do you mean?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> ...I wasn&#39;t going to say anything until the end, but there&#39;s nothing for it. I&#39;m coming clean.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> The ritual here at Fuyuki will succeed, unlike in the past and future, and it will lead to the activation of the Greater Grail.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> The reason all of this was observed by Sheba\u2014was that this area had to be the cause of the Singularity.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I see! It wasn&#39;t just observed as an unstable dimension, but as the origin of the collapse that would become the Singularity!</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> You guys...know not only of the past, but also the future? From a different temporal axis?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> That is correct. I witnessed the failure of the fourth war, investigated the fifth war, and prevented the sixth war from happening. That&#39;s who I am.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> And I&#39;ve assumed the role of pinpointing what makes this battle different from the others I&#39;ve known.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> And the answer to that...is you, Irisviel. You are the vessel of the Holy Grail, and also a Master that controls a Servant.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> It was supposed to take another 10 years to complete. The Einzbern family&#39;s ultimate homunculus.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> Ten years? That&#39;s...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> It&#39;s a small difference, but this is a definite advantage.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> I mean, for the Einzbern family to find a way to win not via a makeshift guerilla warfare, but actual frontal assault...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Having a Master with the highest specs, commanding the strongest Servant, and access to the Lesser Grail.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Victory is certain for Einzbern. And this victory is plenty reason...for the Counter Force to activate.</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong> ...The Holy Grail War you know of didn&#39;t have any interference from the Counter Force?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> That&#39;s right. It wasn&#39;t a factor during the third war. Meanwhile the chance of success was about fifty-fifty during the fourth and fifth war.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> At the very least, from the perspective of the World there was no real emergency to get involved.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> During the fourth war, the Einzberns&#39; research results were behind by one whole generation. When they finally completed their research during the fifth war, they made a mistake in their strategy.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> To be honest, I&#39;m surprised to see that this time the Einzberns managed to call checkmate on everyone.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> So to sum things up, this Singularity is basically...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...the embodiment of the \u201Cif\u201D situation where the Einzberns are the superior contestant in this war.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Yes, and the Holy Grail reading that Chaldea picked up was most likely Irisviel&#39;s magical circuits themselves...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Seeing how perfect the results of the Einzberns&#39; research are this time, you can probably even call her a pseudo Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> I&#39;m not sure whether or not you&#39;re praising me or insulting me, but I&#39;m going to need you to explain more.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> What do you mean the world will end if the Fuyuki Holy Grail is completed?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Yes, allow me to tell you everything. Agent of the Counter Force, you should follow along, as well.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> I&#39;ll show you an even better way to accomplish the task you have been given.</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong> A simpler and even more certain way than destroying this homunculus here?</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Well, I can&#39;t say that it&#39;s entirely simpler, but let me ask you something instead, Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Would you do anything because it&#39;s the simpler way? Do you wish to kill Irisviel here, no matter what happens?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> ...Fou?</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong> ...I do not know. I have not thought of that. I had resigned myself to thinking there was no other choice. I did not have the luxury of options.</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong> And now that you&#39;re telling me to choose... I am faced with a conflict within myself that is rather difficult to explain.</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong> If you&#39;re telling me there is a different choice with this homunculus...then I think I would like to explore that as well.</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong> I wonder why? I&#39;ve never experienced this feeling before.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> That&#39;s because you still have a human heart left in you.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> A foolish but noble soul, from before you became part of the machine known as the Counter Force.</p><h2 id="act-15-to-the-greater-grail" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#act-15-to-the-greater-grail" aria-hidden="true">#</a> ACT-15: &quot;To the Greater Grail&quot;</h2><p><strong>Matou Kariya:</strong> ...And so, that&#39;s how I became Berserker&#39;s Master.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> Hmm.

Matou Kariya, I&#39;ll do that for the appropriate price.</p><p><strong>Matou Kariya:</strong> Y-You want to solve this with money?</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> Not at all.

There couldn&#39;t be a better ally if we had him on our side.</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong> No matter when or where we&#39;re called for battle, we will always shed blood for purposes beyond human intellect.</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong> It is not unusual for us to find ourselves against everyone, without being understood by a single person.</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong> ...So this is a strange feeling. It&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve worked with someone...Huh?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Yes, they were caught in my Bounded Field as well. As I thought. I guess Presence Concealment doesn&#39;t work against a better Assassin.</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong> I&#39;m also good at lurking in the shadows. Both of us are aware of what the other is capable of.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...An Assassin Servant!? You two are amazing. I couldn&#39;t tell at all!</p><p><strong>Assassin:</strong> How dare you... Don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to win just because you prevented my first strike! I&#39;m going to get you all this time!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Watch out. They&#39;re different than the fragments we&#39;ve dealt with up until now.

The Master must&#39;ve been replaced.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Perhaps Tohsaka, having lost Archer, was plotting a comeback by switching to Assassin.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> The Tohsaka family is a hot mess.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That elegant man&#39;s luck is the worst.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Humph.

Now that we are here, it&#39;s obvious that the magical energy radiating from the Greater Grail has been altered.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> ...Yes. Unfortunately. This is not even close to the Holy Grail that we sought after.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> How ironic. By the time victory was finally within our reach, what we&#39;d desperately desired to win had already been destroyed...</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> Even before checking its contents, I can strongly feel the evil presence hiding within.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> Is it okay to just break this carelessly?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Only three Servants have been defeated. That&#39;s not enough to awaken A\u014Bra Mainiiu.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Even if it overflows, it&#39;ll be just a mass of ambiguous curses with no purpose at this point. We can handle it with the force that we have now.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...Wait. I&#39;m picking up magical energy! A Servant is approaching at incredible speed!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> That speed is not normal. It must be a type of Noble Phantasm that can increase mobility!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Increase mobility? That means...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Yes, it must be Rider.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Rider!? Why now!?</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> Oh, good, good. Looks like it&#39;s still not too late.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Do you still intend to continue the Holy Grail War? Don&#39;t you sense the cursed magical energy that&#39;s coming from the Greater Grail?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> That is not the wish granter you were looking for!

Well, I don&#39;t give a damn.</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong> You don&#39;t!?</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> No. I just came to stop you guys from running away with the winnings.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> You, the strategist with a wry face. This is the perfect battlefield for us, I must say.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fooou?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> ...I don&#39;t get it. What is it that makes you oppose us so much?</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> It seems you somehow can see what lies beyond our fate, but isn&#39;t that boring?</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> If that&#39;s really the case, I must at least play the role of someone who ruins your plan.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> What?</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> I can tell, you&#39;re also chasing a shadow on the path of conquest. Which means you share the same joy as me, the King of Conquerors.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> I must entertain a fellow like you. For that&#39;s my duty as a king.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Entertain... You stand as our enemy only to make him laugh?</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> That&#39;s crazy...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Yes, he&#39;s most certainly crazy. However, it&#39;s a motivation befitting of this Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> While there is no limit to this king&#39;s selfish arrogance, his actions are based on his interest in others. In fact\u2014</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> He might look like a goril\u2013 Excuse me, a brute, but the truth is, he&#39;s notorious for meddling in others&#39; business!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> B-But you should also excel at assessing the situation!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> It&#39;s obvious the kind of catastrophe this curse-filled Greater Grail is capable of causing!

Unless you enjoy the challenge that&#39;s in front of you, life has no meaning.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> Get more fired up, strategist. I will even stake my own path of conquest. Come, time to finish this.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> For you to go that far... Are you saying... I am worthy as your opponent?</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> Of course. Though I have no knowledge of where you came from and how you are connected with me.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> But what stands in front of me is indeed a warrior.

You no longer have the ability to transform into the Holy Grail. What do you intend to do now?</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> Yes. Now that the Holy Grail War has been rendered meaningless, my existence is of no value.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> I helped to destroy the Greater Grail with my own hands. There&#39;s no way that I can return to Einzbern now...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Umm, our original goal included recovering the Holy Grail that appeared in this Singularity.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> If you like, why not return with us to Chaldea?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Yeah.

Zhuge Liang as well. Relax. You&#39;ll soon return to your ordinary, mediocre self.</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong> You were right. This power is still a bit too much for me.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Now that you know that, it is time to continue your studies.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Someday, you will be forced to bear this power.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Be consoled by the fact that you still have time. Become strong while you still can.</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong> You sound just like Rider.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> Humph, don&#39;t embarrass me. I am still no match for the King of Conquerors.</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong> \u201CStill,\u201D you say? Does that mean you&#39;re also training? To eventually be his equal?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> The route to the surface is a labyrinth of caves, so I&#39;ll take you there. Then we part ways.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, foou.</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong> I guess I should say goodbye as well.</p><p><strong>Waver:</strong> You&#39;re not returning to the surface?</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong> I don&#39;t originally belong to this world, so it&#39;s a waste of time. If I wait, I&#39;ll soon be summoned back to the Throne.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi:</strong> That&#39;s right, I forgot what type of being you were.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong> ...It&#39;s strange. After we met, I had the feeling that only death would separate us.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> Yes, it&#39;s weird, but I don&#39;t know why. Yet...this strange feeling is not unpleasant.</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong> Yeah. Same here...</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong> ...I thought I was cursed to fulfill my mission only through sacrifice or death.</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong> Now, for the first time, I feel like I was able to fight to protect something.</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong> Thank you. ...Although I don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s my place to say such words.</p><p><strong>Irisviel:</strong> Yes. Goodbye. I&#39;m glad I could meet you, nameless Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Good work! You went through a lot this time.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Foou, foou.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Da Vinci is now giving Miss Irisviel a thorough checkup.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;m surprised. I never thought a Holy Grail could exist in such a form.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What about Lord El-Melloi? How are his injuries?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Compared to a genuine Servant, Servants like us who possess the flesh of human beings</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> will die if they suffer too much damage...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Yes. He&#39;ll be in the ICU for a while. He needs complete rest.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> How reckless to have someone else form a contract with a Heroic Spirit while seriously injured.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> He was nonchalant so you wouldn&#39;t be alarmed, but he was actually in really bad shape.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Foou.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But, thanks to him, we somehow pulled through... Also, the Heroic Spirit who was an agent of the Counter Force...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Right. What a strange encounter. To think that even after humanity&#39;s history has been incinerated, the Counter Force would still function.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What is this \u201CCounter Force\u201D?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What was he, exactly?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The Counter Force...in theory, it&#39;s a force that acts to preserve the human race.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It&#39;s said that people who accomplished rare feats of valor in life are summoned by this Counter Force.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> If a crisis threatens the human race, they are summoned through time and space to eliminate the source of the calamity.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So they are Servants who have no Masters, summoned solely to fight?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Yes. Even in death, their souls are tasked with a mission to fight for all eternity.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I cannot possibly understand their feelings... They must endure unspeakable anguish.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Yes. Although I&#39;m a mere Demi-Servant and not a Heroic Spirit,</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I cannot imagine being summoned to battle without a Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Really?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. What supports me in battle is you, Senpai, the one I sealed a contract with.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That bond gives me the strength and courage to overcome fear. To fight without such support would be too cruel.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Foou...</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong> Will you come out already? You&#39;re the star performer. No one will interfere now.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> Humph! So you knew. I don&#39;t want to! What a pain.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> Isn&#39;t conserving energy popular in this age? I wanted to catch you off your guard.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> Well, good job picking up on me instead. I appreciate the welcome. Less lonely.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> But why didn&#39;t you warn your friends of the danger?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> They only destroyed a contaminated Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> I, A\u014Bra Mainiiu, its contents, remain separate.</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong> I didn&#39;t want to rely on the help of others intervening from another world.</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong> Your curse belongs solely to this world. It does not extend to theirs. It&#39;s logical for me to deal with you alone.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong> Oh, how nice. It&#39;s a fine thing to take pride in one&#39;s work.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong> I guess it would be painful for us to be pitied when we fight. No one would gain anything.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong> Happiness is everything, right? Well, anyway\u2014</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong> ...In that sense, you&#39;re just as much on the losing side as I am.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong> I know you&#39;re a mass murderer by your scent.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong> I bet you&#39;ll come \u201Chere\u201D in the end. After you&#39;re worn out by an eternity of abuse.</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong> I don&#39;t think so. This is the fate I have chosen. I was never compelled to, nor did I ever give in.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong> That&#39;s precisely why. You should have broken down somewhere along the line. That way you would have had a chance at peace, even salvation.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong> But because you couldn&#39;t stop being a \u201CHero of Justice\u201D until the very end, even after death, you became a cogwheel in a mechanism like the Counter Force.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong> Surely that&#39;s proof you&#39;re on the losing side.</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong> My life led me to this point. I have no regrets. I do admit that we&#39;re fundamentally similar.</p><p><strong>Assassin?:</strong> You&#39;ll curse the world, and I&#39;ll save it. We are both devices with assigned roles. That&#39;s all.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong> \u2014 (Grin)</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong> Okay. If you&#39;re so sure, I guess I have to show you my respect.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong> If curses and salvation face each other, there is no choice. We must both seek love and recognition in the way we know best.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong> For such an occasion, why don&#39;t you name yourself? Unlike me, you remember your own name, yeah?</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AEmiya Kiritsugu:</strong> Emiya... Kiritsugu. Or so I was called when I lived as a human being.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AEmiya Kiritsugu:</strong> I will save the world. I did so until now, and I will forever.</p><p><strong>A\u014Bra Mainiiu:</strong> There ain&#39;t a world that can be saved by humans. How long will you try to disprove that conclusion!</p><h2 id="act-ex-retrieving-the-holy-grail" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#act-ex-retrieving-the-holy-grail" aria-hidden="true">#</a> ACT-EX: &quot;Retrieving the Holy Grail&quot;</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai? Do we still need something here? I believe the case is closed...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the last Holy Grail...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Uh, you know. Standard procedure.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I see... Senpai&#39;s sixth sense... I understand.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I, Mash Kyrielight, shall search the premises as Senpai&#39;s Servant!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ahhh\u2014!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Mash!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That was fast!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master, this is bad! Look what I found sprawled out in the shade, near the cliff!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong> Ouch, that hurts, that hurts! Don&#39;t pull so hard! I&#39;m weak, so if you pull too hard something&#39;ll snap off!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> There is a suspicious-looking figure lying on the ground!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s the shadow itself\u2014!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. I cannot grasp its identity even in light. But it is not quite a Shadow Servant...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What should we do, Master? He does not seem particularly evil...</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong> Oh, so supple. Hmm, fine curves too... (Rub rub)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Hyahhh!?</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong> Heh heh. Perks of being injured. Time to recover! Even on the verge of death, a beast&#39;s instincts are uncontrollable!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong> You have quite a fine Servant with you! She would give my former Master a run for her money!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong> I&#39;m just talking about looks, of course. It&#39;s sad, but both are still mentally children.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> This...is a Perverted Servant!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Mash, give him a good beating.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Y-Yes! I, Mash Kyrielight, shall mercilessly exterminate him with my new moves!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong> Ahh\u2014!? You wretches seriously beat on an injured person!?</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong> This is a scene where a virtuous person would ask, \u201CWhy were you lying on the ground?\u201D</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I beg your pardon. I&#39;ll try it again.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Why aren&#39;t you still on the ground? It looks like you&#39;re still breathing, but...</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong> That can happen. Dead, but not really dead. You see, resurrection is my special ability.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong> Ah, never mind. This isn&#39;t the time to bring that up.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong> I know about you people. You&#39;re the ones who destroyed the Greater Grail along with that Counter Force fellow.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Y-Yes. Do you know about Senpai?</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong> I do. I observed your Master fighting for a bit from the best seat in the house. So, anyway, what?</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong> It&#39;s your fault that I was lying collapsed on the ground... Would you believe me if I said that?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Our fault?</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong> I&#39;ll explain the rest, Avenger. At ease.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Iri!? But that form...</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong> Hello, Mash and Fujimaru. Good work.</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong> I&#39;m the Dress of Heaven. I&#39;m a different entity than Irisviel, with whom you were working until just a while ago\u2014</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong> Simply put, I&#39;m like the spirit of the Greater Grail.</p><p><strong>Avenger:</strong> That&#39;s right. You people destroyed a woman in black, didn&#39;t you? Think of her as a good version of that.</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong> That&#39;s a crude explanation, Avenger. Why can&#39;t you be more classy...</p><p><strong>Avenger:</strong> Forgive me. At any rate, you were beating me viciously until just a moment ago. Of course I&#39;m going to harbor a deep grudge.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Iri is the one who beat that man in black to within an inch of his life?</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong> ...Well, I hate to say it, but yes and no.</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong> Fujimaru. Listen closely, for this is your group&#39;s problem as well.</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong> You destroyed the black Holy Grail. That&#39;s fine. I don&#39;t mind. Even though it was painful.</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong> But to be honest, that was a mistake. You shouldn&#39;t have done it.</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong> The reason is\u2014</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong> The reason is, the way you destroyed it was too lenient!</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong> You should&#39;ve done it more thoroughly! For example, you could&#39;ve blown it up together with one floor of a luxury hotel!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Spoken like a rock star!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...All right, this is starting to sound familiar.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um... Iri? What do you mean by that?</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong> I&#39;m saying you were too naive. You didn&#39;t completely destroy the black Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong> You broke the vessel in a clumsy manner. As a result, the Lesser Grail...</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong> Irisviel was broken into shards and scattered. Each of those shards has begun working independently.</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong> They are\u2014 Fire Iri, Water Iri, Earth Iri, and Wind Iri!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> The four elements of Irisviel!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That&#39;s too many.</p><p><strong>Avenger:</strong> Exactly. Four of them are too much to handle. I tried to get them to calm down...</p><p><strong>Avenger:</strong> ...But I was just wasting my breath, as they attacked me.</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong> Yes. Like the original Irisviel, the four split-up elements would be kind under normal circumstances.</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong> But Fire Iri, who is particularly extreme, rose up in revolt.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Fire Iri?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Revolt?</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong> Yes. And like leaping flames, the other Iris were awakened to their violent side.</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong> Sad to say... but even after gaining their freedom and individual personalities, their grudge against you didn&#39;t disappear.</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong> Do you understand, Fujimaru? Your war isn&#39;t over yet.</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong> Four types of Irisviel, let loose in Fuyuki. You have a responsibility and a duty to defeat them.</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong> They&#39;re, how can I put it... Anyway, persistent, immune to discouragement, and obstinate.</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong> I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll come back after you beat them. But please stick with them until the job is done.</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong> Besides, it looks like that gloomy, yet shy, sensitive, and handsome man... Ahem. I mean, the hooded assassin has gone back.</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong> In the first place, that man isn&#39;t suited for this kind of job, right?</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong> I&#39;m asking you as a favor, on behalf of Avenger.</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong> Assassin... Save the city of Fuyuki instead of him. Only you people can do this job.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Sure. Leave it to us.</p><p><strong>The Dress of Heaven:</strong> Thank you. I was hoping for that answer, cute Master\u2661</p><p><strong>Avenger:</strong> Are we done talking? Then I&#39;m counting on you folks to take care of the rest.</p><p><strong>Avenger:</strong> I&#39;m not suited for fighting and I hear that woman in white doesn&#39;t want to see me, undisciplined as I am.</p><p><strong>Avenger:</strong> From here on out, this is your domain.
