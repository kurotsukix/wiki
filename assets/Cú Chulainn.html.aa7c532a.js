I&#39;m not a hunter.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Besides, there are others better suited than me. Fionn&#39;s first spear, maybe. Know the guy?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Well, I don&#39;t think he&#39;d want to deal with a boar... That&#39;s one of the biggest traumas in all his stories...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You mean Diarm\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Then maybe Ata</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Stop, Senpai. Everyone has something they don&#39;t like.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Oh, fine... Sure. G\xE1e Bolg was getting rusty anyway.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Oh, I see we&#39;re heading out now. In a rush, huh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s no boar, it&#39;s a stray homunculus. Master, prepare for combat!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> I guess that&#39;s it, then. So, where&#39;s this boar?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s strange. They said it attacks as soon as you enter the forest, but instead...we saw a homunculus...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> ...Oh, here we go. Animal tracks. This one is big.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Good work. I guess no monster is a match for the great hero of Celtic legend, huh?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Flattery will get you nowhere. Let&#39;s go, Master. Still...This is weird\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh...Senpai, let&#39;s go.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> \u2013Wait. There it is. This way.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Huh!? I&#39;m not picking up anything on my end...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> \u2013Under those rocks. Looks like we&#39;ve got a problem on our hands.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s a big boar... But it&#39;s already dead.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It&#39;s huge... You can barely call it a boar now.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Really? This is nothing, our boars had runes on their back.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Celtic boars ate runes, huh? That explains why some were tougher than dragons.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But what could kill a boar that&#39;s this size?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> \u2013We&#39;ll talk later missy. Here it is...Our real prey!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> What! A chimera? Why is something like that here?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master, get back. Let&#39;s do this!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Looks like an unskilled mage is just letting it roam free... Well, whatever.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> I don&#39;t know where a chimera&#39;s heart is, but your luck ran out when you met me.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> It ain&#39;t a great heart, but it&#39;s worth aiming for. All right, your heart is mine\u2014!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> I guess chimera&#39;s heart is just as fragile. It was only playing dead, huh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No, it was a strong enough enemy... Master, are you hurt anywhere?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> No, I&#39;m fine.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> By the way, what is that doing here?</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> ...I see, so that&#39;s what&#39;s going on. Hey, step back a bit.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> \u2014Should be around here. There we go.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Could that be...rune spells?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai, there&#39;s a cave beneath the rock!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> It was being concealed by spells. This is an abandoned workshop.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Being third-rate doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s okay to be sloppy, too. If you&#39;re gonna leave, at least tidy up.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I see. Test objects were left roaming free when the workshop was abandoned...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> This boar hunt may have taken an odd turn, but can we say it&#39;s been taken care of?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What do we do with the remains of the chimera and the boar? We can&#39;t just leave them here...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Yeah, how about turning them into a stew? The job&#39;s done, and I&#39;m hungry!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Boar stew? Sounds great!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Is Chimera stew even safe?</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Sure you can eat it. You can eat anything, as long as it&#39;s muscle. Just make sure it&#39;s cooked and you&#39;re set.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Well, if it&#39;s rotten and gives me the runs after it&#39;s sterilized, I&#39;ll deal with it then.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Right, tonight we dine in style! I&#39;ll get this cooked up and share it with you Chaldea guys!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Foooooou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Speaking of which, you sure know how to cook. You&#39;re a Heroic Spirit of many talents, I guess.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> I&#39;ve been on my own a lot in my life. Oh, the chimera tastes pretty good, huh?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou! (Nom nom)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You think it&#39;s good too, Fou?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I don&#39;t know if you people are fearless or what...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Who knows what&#39;s in a chimera, but you&#39;re just gobbling it down.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s surprisingly good!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It&#39;s fine like this.</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> ...Hold it.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> If this is a chimera, did it use dogs as parts?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Who knows? A chimera is made by fusing all sorts of creatures together.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It could contain any number of them. But, so what if it did?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> You should have told me that first, you idiot! I can&#39;t believe this! I&#39;m leaving!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh!? You&#39;re done?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> I don&#39;t want it! See you! Dammit! I can&#39;t believe this!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What&#39;s with him?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Oh, is it possible...</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Oh, the Hound of Culann... He swore he&#39;d never eat a dog, didn&#39;t he?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Didn&#39;t he consider himself a replacement... for the guard dog he killed? Ah, so that&#39;s why...(Nom nom)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It tastes good, though...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> We messed up.</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!</p>',97),a=[e];function h(i,g){return n(),o("div",null,a)}var u=t(r,[["render",h],["__file","C\xFA Chulainn.html.vue"]]);export{u as default};
