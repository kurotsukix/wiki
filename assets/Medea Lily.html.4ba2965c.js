I&#39;m Medea, and my class is Caster.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> I have been devoted to practicing magecraft as head priestess of a shrine under Hecate, Goddess of the moon.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> So, you can relax when I&#39;m around, and treat me like a housekeeper who can use magic.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Wow... So she&#39;s that Medea? Man, how did she turn into a devil like that?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s rude, Roman.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I agree. Stop talking, Doctor.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That&#39;s why girls don&#39;t like you, Doctor.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I agree. Now I understand why you are into net idols.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;m telling you, me not being popular with girls has nothing to do with me being a fan of Magi\u2606Mari!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Apologize to all the idol fans!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Anyhow, Medea... Well, Lily. Why did you call Senpai out to a place like this?</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Well, actually, while I was \u201Cpraying\u201D for everyone&#39;s health, I detected a terrible aura on this island.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> It&#39;d be catastrophic if left unchecked... No, even worse, I can&#39;t bear to watch a crack form in their friendship...</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> When I thought that, Fujimaru&#39;s face came to mind. With a beautiful, gleaming smile\u2661</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Um... You mean, you want Fujimaru to mediate a fight?</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Yes\u2661 I&#39;d be happy if Master can persuade them with some virtue.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Speaking of which, I can hear the sounds of swords clashing coming from the woods.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai, I have a bad feeling about it... Let&#39;s go check it out.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Hehe, you are such a worrywart, Mash. There&#39;s not even a teaspoonful of danger.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I can&#39;t overlook your undisciplined behavior any more!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Even my patience, which is as wide and firm as Carcassonne, has just been worn out!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> That&#39;s actually my line, you sulky saint! I don&#39;t care if you say, \u201Cbe temperate,\u201D or \u201Cbe restrained\u201D!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> You&#39;re not convincing at all, saying that with your flabby figure!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> You were trying so hard with that high-school girl image, I thought I&#39;d laugh to death! I&#39;ll seek compensation on behalf of all Servants!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Wh-What&#39;s wrong with high-school girls\u2014!?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> And Jeanne Alter? What kind of joke is that\u2014!?</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Oh dear.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I guess you can call this... Hell?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Okay folks, let&#39;s pretend we didn&#39;t see that and go back. This is a case we must not get involved in.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I totally agree.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Oh no Fujimaru, I thought I could count on you!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Senpai, let&#39;s try and help out. It&#39;s also scary to see Lily crying.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You think I can just walk away?</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Fujimaru! Yes, I knew you would help me! I believe in you!</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...All right then. Go ahead, Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Stop fighting!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Yes, that Alter was questionable!</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Are you siding with Astolfo? You are, aren&#39;t you? Pervert! Go to hell!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> You somehow look familiar to me, but I&#39;ll show you no mercy if you intend to get in my way!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Come, messengers of the saint, winds of discipline! Gather under my flag and swear absolute obedience to me!</p><p><strong>Wyvern:</strong> Grrr. Help m\u2013, grrr!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Ugh! (\u2190SHOOK)</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> See, even I can do something as trivial as commanding wyverns!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I was just hiding that until I got angry because once I do this, I feel like I&#39;ll lose something more important than my image!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Hey, isn&#39;t she actually Alter!? Wait, we can talk it out! Let&#39;s just talk!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> If anything, I&#39;m totally on Team Jeanne!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> No more excuses, no apologies accepted! Come on! Get them Team Jeanne! Punish these rude people!</p><p><strong>Wyvern:</strong> Grrr. You&#39;re mea\u2013, grrr!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Oh, no... My followers were easily defeated!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Hmph, of course. They were merely fans who succumbed to the influence of that flag!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> It&#39;s my turn now! Guys, it&#39;s time to come out!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Nyahaaa!? (SHOOK)</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> An army of horses\u2014!?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> See? Those are my allies who I brainwashed with the horn&#39;s power!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Now, brace yourself, fake saint! How dare you get a high school girl version before me! I must kill you now!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh no, it&#39;s going to turn into another battle! Master, please do something!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Stop fighting!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That miniskirt is questionable!</p><hr><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Speaking of which, who are you guys anyway? Whatever. I don&#39;t care, I&#39;ll take you all out together!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> My rationality has evaporated away! I&#39;ll deal with the complicated stuff after I win!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> This one is just as terrible! Be careful, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huff, huff... You two, please calm down... We are strangers who just happened to be passing by...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Hmm, although I hope more than Astolfo&#39;s rationality would evaporate, that annoying pink hair is still a respectable knight...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> To be able to defeat an army led by someone like that...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Unbelievable! Jeanne may be slow physically AND mentally, but she&#39;s still a sub-heroine who is my rival...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> To be able to defeat an army like that...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um, they actually get along, don&#39;t they?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Now that it&#39;s come to this. Let&#39;s team up, Astolfo! Come on!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Of course, we&#39;ll defeat our enemies together! We&#39;ll show them our outstanding combination!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Okay, we&#39;ve reached a conclusion! I&#39;ve had enough. Fujimaru, take them both down!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Bring the judgment of reasoning upon those two Berserkers!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Jeanne &amp; Astolfo:</strong> Noooooo!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Target defeated. However, the issue has not been resolved yet.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Yeah, it&#39;s going from bad to worse. I guess they can be really violent when snapped\u2014</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> No need to worry. You can leave this to me. Let me start by taking out my dagger...</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Hm, around here? Or maybe here? Here we go, Pain Breaker!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Medea!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Wh-Wh-Wh-What just happened!? Did you really stab a Noble Phantasm into an unconscious Heroic Spirit who couldn&#39;t resist!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Let&#39;s pretend we didn&#39;t see it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...It was an awful incident...</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Uh... Huh? Where is this... There&#39;s someone on top of me...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Astolfo!? How did you get that terrible bump on your head!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Who did that to you!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Well, that&#39;s Jea\u2013</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Shh! Don&#39;t tell her, Mash. You didn&#39;t see any bruise caused by that flag. Got it?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Uh... Huh!? Where is this... Is someone under me...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Jeanne! How did you get those cuts? It&#39;s like someone kept targeting your chest!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Who did that to you!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Well, I&#39;m saying that was As\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Silence is gold, Mash.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...There was no awful incident...</p><hr><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Excellent. It appears they fought over trivial matters, but they are back to normal now.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...I see. I now remember Medea Lily&#39;s alignment is the opposite of Princess Medea&#39;s.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> So her Noble Phantasm is also the direct opposite to that of the treacherous witch. Her Noble Phantasm resolves conflicts.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> At any rate... Here you go. I&#39;m relieved to see you have no other injuries, Astolfo.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> By the way, you promised you&#39;d take me on a trip above the sky. Is your hippogriff still around?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Of course, Jeanne. You weigh as much as you look, right? Then, it should have no issues flying with you aboard!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Sounds fun. I&#39;m sure your hippogriff will provide quite a\u2014</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Oh. Hi, Fujimaru. And...sniff-sniff.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Is this sweet smell... honey?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, there&#39;s been a terribly delicious scent in the air since a little while ago.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Indeed, I had the time to make some pancakes.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> I hope you&#39;ll forget terrible things and enjoy your happy afternoon with these.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> That&#39;s very nice. Somehow I&#39;m really hungry. ...I wonder if I exercised or something...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Wow, they&#39;re delicious! I love these pancakes! Hey, Jeanne, you should try them!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Yes, let me try some... Oh, wow! A Noble Phantasm level of sweetness?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> They quickly became a pair of girls happily enjoying sweets together...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Friendship is beautiful.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Another pancake, please.</p><hr><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Hehehe. This is all thanks to your help.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Thank you so much for handling my crazy request. I hope I continue to have your support, Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Well, you have extraordinary skills. You are a master of settling quarrels.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Yes, I am. Because I&#39;m a friendly witch\u2661</p><h2 id="pancakes-of-happiness" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pancakes-of-happiness" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Pancakes of Happiness</h2><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Well, it should be around here...</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Oh, please wait a minute Master! Let me scout around first.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (Sigh) We&#39;re really here, Senpai. We can no longer turn back.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Ah, I wonder what kind of blood ritual we&#39;re going to witness. Fujimaru&#39;s courage will be tested...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Hahaha, you two are overreacting.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Are you two still against it?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s not that I&#39;m against it, it&#39;s just a headache... Remember what happened an hour ago, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> \u266A\u266A\u266A</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You&#39;re in a good mood as usual, Medea. I heard you settled a fight between the King of Heroes and the King of Conquerors.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Stopping a serious fight between those two is not something an average Heroic Spirit can do.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> What&#39;s your secret to reconciliation? Curses don&#39;t work for them, I assume.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Oh, they don&#39;t fight because they hate each other.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> They just want to throw their opinions at each other. So, I found an acceptable middle ground...</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> ...and offered pancakes to them at the end. Pancakes can be really handy at times.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> O-Oh, really? Were there cakes back in your era?</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> I learned about them after I was summoned to the present age.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> I found something to get into other than magecraft, and people are really enjoying them. I am very happy.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> (I see. We can&#39;t go up against that. Even dragons would stop fighting when faced with such a happy aura of hers...)</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Oh, but... I have recently come across a problem. The food stockpile in Chaldea is, well...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Oh, right. We have food for a year, but none can be used towards sweets.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Medea, can&#39;t you do anything about it with your magecraft?</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Well, if I Rayshift somewhere, I can create as many ingredients as I want with alchemy...</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> But when I return to Chaldea, I can only bring back whatever I can carry.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Even going through the space-time gate, I can barely carry enough for Fujimaru and Mash.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> I&#39;m afraid I can only bring back enough ingredients for one pancake. Oh!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> What is it? Did something inspire you?</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Yes! I just had a wonderful idea! This is probably all thanks to the genius Da Vinci!</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> If you can carry only one pancake, you just need to make that one pancake edible forever!</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Yes, how about we obtain the magical factor of a Demon God Pillar, an ingredient that regenerates even after countless destruction!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Excuse me?</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Oh, I must tell Fujimaru right away! We should go hunt a Demon God Pillar together!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...And that&#39;s how you gave in to Lily who desperately begged you to go hunting for a Demon God Pillar with her.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I didn&#39;t know Medea was naturally an airhead...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I guess reality hit her after Jason was so terrible to her...</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Everyone, I&#39;ve found it! The residual magical energy of a Demon God Pillar!</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Now, I&#39;ll use this as catalyst to fish for another Demon God Pillar. There are 72 of them, so I&#39;m sure it&#39;s okay just to take one.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You make it sound like a Demon God Pillar is tonight&#39;s dinner...</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Now I shall make a summoning circle. Maple honey... vanilla cream...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Even the spell chants sound sweet for that witch!</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Custard bell, whipped!</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Allez cuis... I mean, I summon thee! Thou born of the abyss, rise from the ashes of evil and answer my call!</p><p><strong>Demon:</strong> CHOOOOOCOOOOLAAAATE!</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> I-I&#39;m sorry, Master! I failed, it&#39;s just a normal demon!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s probably because you cast the wrong spell. It&#39;s because you said, \u201CAllez cuisine\u201D and such.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Don&#39;t point it out, Mash. I regret what I&#39;ve done! For now, let&#39;s send them back!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Oh, what a surprise. Is everyone all right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, barely. I couldn&#39;t bear to be defeated by demons summoned that easily...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Wow, I see that Mash is finally starting to feel pride as a Servant! That&#39;s a good thing!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Well, I just wouldn&#39;t want to disappoint the Heroic Spirit who lets me use his power.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Mash&#39;s right. Those were powerful spirits but not quite enough. They are perfect catalysts for a curse, but that&#39;s not why we&#39;re here today.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> I shall pull myself together and try again... Maple honey... Vanilla cream...</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Custard bell, whipped! I summon thee! Thou born of the abyss, rise from the ashes of evil and answer my call!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> Who calleth me? Who dares summon me using the fragments of my kindred?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Whoa...It really showed up! I had no idea how outstanding you were, Lily!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AMedea:</strong> Yes, yes, it is I! I&#39;m Medea, top pupil of Goddess Hecate, and I summoned you!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> Hm. So you are involved with the Divine Spirits. Then, I shall allow myself to be summoned by you.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> I am Haagenti, one of the 72 Demon Gods. I turn water into wealth, and wealth into water.</p><p><strong>Demon God Pillar Haagenti:</strong> Hope of the Goddess. State your wish. Extermination of mankind? Decline of mankind? Or enslavement of mankind?</p><p><strong>Demon God Pillar Haagenti:</strong> State your evil wish. State your lustful desire. Provide me a curse that is unbearable to listen to!</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Okay! I wish to defeat you so I can take your magical factor!</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> You&#39;re going to be my cooking ingredient!</p><p><strong>Demon God Pillar Haagenti:</strong> Hm. Good, good, words full of curses on manki... Um, pardon?</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> All right, everyone. It&#39;s time to show our true power! Let&#39;s do our best for the sake of pancakes!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Yes! We destroyed the Spirit Core of the Demon God Pillar. Now we just need to transform all this magical energy!</p><p><strong>Demon God Pillar Haagenti:</strong> Ohhh... Ohhhhhhh! This... this... is impossible!</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Shrink, shrink! Shrink like a handful of flour bouncing in a bowl...</p><p><strong>Demon God Pillar Haagenti:</strong> Gaaaaaahh! Gaaaaaahh!</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Pat, pat, maple pat... One scoopful, shrink small like a strawberry...</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> I did it! Cooking is complete! Now I can make the pancake of my dreams, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> This was your dream?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That Demon God Pillar is the ingredient... right?</p><hr><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Yes, so?</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> The magical element has been churned, filtered, and refined to the limit, so it&#39;s no longer what it was originally.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Oh! Did you want to eat a Demon God Pillar-flavored cake? I-I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t realize!</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> I-I&#39;ll summon another pillar right away! Aww, the connection is almost gone. Can I make it in time?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> N-No, we don&#39;t need another Demon God Pillar! I want to eat your pancakes!</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Oh. That&#39;s good to know I just need to cook them as usual.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Okay then, it&#39;ll take me a little time. Please look forward to my pancakes, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> I&#39;ll deliver the best pancakes ever as an expression of my gratitude\u2661</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Poof. She disappeared into thin air. She probably has her own kitchen somewhere in this era.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I now have a better opinion of Jason...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I admire him for changing such an airhead into such a tough, realistic woman...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Medea Lily is hopelessly innocent. She gives what she loves to whom she loves...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I learned that her feeling is unconditional love. If possible, I want to continue protecting her purity.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master.
