The next challenger hails from the Far East.</p><p><strong>Chairperson:</strong> A mysterious fighter called &quot;SAMURAI!!&quot; It&#39;s &quot;SASAKI KOJIROU&quot; and friends!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Why did this happen...?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Her Majesty sure got us this time.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> She asked us to come play at the Colosseum, and this is what happens when we believe her words!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> She told us to risk our lives as gladiators to entertain her. As expected of a historically renown tyrant!!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> And so, as they were forced into this battle. A comment from SAMURAI of the Far East, please.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> Hmm, the Colosseum. A rather special arena, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> And you fit in a little bit too well, Kojirou! Are you here on tour!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;re calm.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Aren&#39;t you scared?</p><hr><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> Well, those walking the path of swordsmanship are prepared for this. Everything you do is part of your training - as my predecessors would say.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> That refreshing smile. You&#39;re amazing, SAMURAI.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> Hmm? No, you&#39;re wrong, Lord Roman. I&#39;m neither a warrior nor a samurai. Just some dude that can wave a stick.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Whaaaaaat!?</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> Besides a sword, I&#39;ve carried hoes before, too. So I am quite handy with peasant works, too.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Whoa...That&#39;s impressive, but how did you become a Heroic Spirit, again...?</p><p><strong>Chairperson:</strong> The first match &quot;SAMURAIS&quot; vs. &quot;Immortal Soldiers!!&quot;</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Wait wait wait, this is messed up!! Immortal!? Are they zombies!? Skeletons!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;ll leave it to you this time, Doctor.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Groovy, Roman.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. It is twice the communications traffic than usual. The Doctor&#39;s interested in Kojirou...or rather, SAMURAI.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> Hmm...so let&#39;s have a fair...fight!!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> Umm. Given your opponent&#39;s build, you&#39;ll need to be creative. Focus on inserting your blade and pulling your arm back, I guess.</p><p><strong>Chairperson:</strong> What an overwhelming force! Who on earth is he? &quot;SAMURAI,&quot; warrior from the Orient!</p><p><strong>Chairperson:</strong> But that&#39;s the extent of his power!! Next up is a gladiator-killing demon!</p><p><strong>Chairperson:</strong> Our champion!! &quot;Demon Sword, the Emissary from Hell!!&quot;</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Any way you slice it, that&#39;s a demon! That&#39;s insane! Isn&#39;t that insane!? What has happened to the reign of Rome!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Calm down, Doctor. That&#39;s a gladiator&#39;s costume.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Oh, I seeee. It&#39;s just a performance to hype up the battle...and you think I&#39;d fall for that!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I mean it&#39;s got wings and a tail!! That transcends the level of a costume!!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Why did the Emperor hire this guy? Is she a moron? I had a feeling all along, but is the Roman Emperor a moron?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> No matter how great a samurai you are, Kojirou... No, even if you were raised in the wild, that&#39;s not fair!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Your opponent transcends Bushido, you know! Default, Kojirou! That would be the best!</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> Hahaha. Lord Roman, you worry too much.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> Don&#39;t worry about me! I fought beasts on a daily basis in the mountains.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> Look. An ox head, bear body, and monkey legs. A worthy opponent, but rather boring.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> Why don&#39;t you relax and enjoy this, Lord Roman? OK, Master. Let&#39;s show off our abilities!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> Hmm. He&#39;s invulnerable like Berserker. Guess this wasn&#39;t just a beast?</p><p><strong>Chairperson:</strong> No matter how much you attack him, he won&#39;t fall!! That&#39;s our champ, &quot;Demon Sword!!&quot;</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> You&#39;re still going to insist that it&#39;s a human fighter! I&#39;m going to make a direct complaint to Emperor Nero!</p><p><strong>Demon Sword:</strong> Ugoaaaaaaaaa!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Watch out, Master!!</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> Hidden Sword\u2013Swallow Reversal!!</p><p><strong>Demon Sword:</strong> Goaaaaaaaa...!!</p><p><strong>Chairperson:</strong> ...!! Wh-What has happened!?</p><p><strong>Chairperson:</strong> Demon Sword, undefeated for 100 battles, has finally fallen!!</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> I guess its stock of resurrection ran out. ...How boring.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> I expected a tough opponent, but it&#39;s still quite far from an enlightenment of a new Hidden Sword.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> Well. I wonder when I&#39;ll meet the one who could surpass the swallow on that day.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> No, no, no. The swallow you fought was absolutely nuts, a phantasmal! Was it a phantasmal?</p><p><strong>Chairperson:</strong> A new champion has risen here!! His name is &quot;SAMURAI,&quot; the warrior of the Orient.</p><p><strong>Chairperson:</strong> We ask the audience to welcome this new champion with a loud round of applause!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This just turned into something amazing, Senpai.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;re amazing, SAMURAI!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That&#39;s right, SAMURAI.</p><hr><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> This is some pretty good cheering. It lacks elegance but the thunderous applause is nice.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> Lord Fujimaru, I&#39;ve caused you trouble. Well, let&#39;s have a drink to celebrate the victory.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> Will there be a bag of rice, too? Man, a place where you can make money from martial arts! This is a nice town!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> \u2013After that, the fighter from the Orient piled on victory after victory as a great Gladiator in Roman history</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> and became a legend among the people for a long time henceforth...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> \u2013Well, that bit of Roman gladiator history continues to be described about in detail but</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Have anything to say, Kojirou?</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> No, I was just excited. Forgive me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It was incredible! Swallow Reversal 100 slashes!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Her Majesty was delighted, too.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Kojirou was really popular. The merchandise was flying off the shelves, too!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Emperor Nero was having a fit though. She said, &quot;I shall be the 100th opponent!&quot;</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But, I am surprised that the history can tolerate this amount of changes.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> No, it can&#39;t tolerate at all. Romani, what are we going to do about this?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Well...We went there to correct the history, and now we actually ended up changing it...What should we do, Fou?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Fou said, &quot;Super Overtime.&quot; Doctor, do you want to eat the food we got as prizes?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Don&#39;t need it, return it to Rome!</p>',90),n=[s];function i(h,p){return t(),r("div",null,n)}var u=o(a,[["render",i],["__file","Sasaki Kojirou.html.vue"]]);export{u as default};
