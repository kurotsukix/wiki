Robin&#39;s buying things from that shop. Did you tell him to do that?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yes, I asked him to guard the area.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> As expected, Senpai knows exactly what to do with Servants. If there&#39;s nothing to do, have them patrol.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...I don&#39;t remember asking him anything...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Then he&#39;s just walking around on his own?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Well, until they&#39;re needed they&#39;re free to do what they want, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> Those beat up old blades? If you&#39;re just gonna give them to the blacksmith I&#39;ll take all you&#39;ve got.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> Oh, and a dozen lengths of rope. Throw in some rags, too.</p><p><strong>Man:</strong> Yeah, sure thing. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re taking this junk off my hands, but what will you use them for?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> Who knows? But junk&#39;s got its uses. You can put it together into something good.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> Hey, this is a nice blanket. Didn&#39;t think I&#39;d see something like this. I&#39;ll take it.</p><p><strong>Man:</strong> That&#39;s an expensive blanket. You sleep in your cape, what will you do with it?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> My new boss is a wimp who&#39;s not used to camping.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Looks like he&#39;s buying a lot. Should we talk to him, Master?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Hello Robin, are you buying something?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> Oh, Master and Lady Mash. Fancy seeing you here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m kind of surprised to see you here Robin... It&#39;s rare for a Servant to go shopping.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> Maybe so. Compared to the other guys, I&#39;m a little plain, right? I feel more at home in places like this.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> But again, this is perfect timing. I&#39;m going hunting, want to tag along?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Hunting? Is that code for you&#39;re going gambling?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> What kind of guy do you think I am? Not gambling, plain old hunting.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> ...Quietly. Quietly. I saw some weird animal tracks around here.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> I set some traps over the past few days... Got it! Bingo! They fell for it.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> This area up ahead is a blind alley. It&#39;ll be easy to trap them.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You really did mean hunting...</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> Of course I did. What did you think I was doing?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> They didn&#39;t make me a Servant just because I&#39;m good looking. I&#39;m a master hunter.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What did you trap?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> Haha, you&#39;ll have to find out. Something perfect for a growing Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Robin, it&#39;s pulling! The line is pulling!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> All right, let&#39;s do this! This is some rare prey. Don&#39;t let it escape, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That was amazing! Master, Robin is a master hunter!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Totally agree! Do it again!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> He&#39;s the best! Gimme more!</p><hr><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> Hahaha, you&#39;re a greedy one, huh Master? Let&#39;s move on to the next trap then.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Roger!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> Quietly, quietly...Oh, this one too. Although this is one I hoped they wouldn&#39;t trigger.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You hoped they wouldn&#39;t trigger?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> Yeah, unlike the other place, there are signs of people staying here.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> They&#39;re pros too, so they&#39;ve hidden themselves well, but... See? 3, 2, 1, 0.</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> GYAAAAHHH! A trap! A hidden pit!</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> Scouts, what were you doing? There&#39;s spear tips smeared with cow dung on the bottom!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I hear terrible screaming! Robin, what was that?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Damn, enemy soldiers!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Damn! Definitely not a bonus character!</p><hr><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> These guys were getting ready to attack the town. See? This is important, too.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> If we can get rid of them here, they can&#39;t hurt the town and the enemy won&#39;t know our location.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> Just like they said, scouts are the most basic and critical part of war.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> A bonus is important, but you need basic recon work too. Don&#39;t forget that, Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Y-Yeah. Robin is right! This is important too! No, it&#39;s more important!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yeah, let&#39;s go, Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Damn it! Let&#39;s do this, Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Roger\u2014I&#39;ll change my feeling of misplaced hope into rage, Master!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> Oh, how brave! Let&#39;s do this nice and easy. Nice and easy.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Whew! We ended up going around the whole forest.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But it paid off, bigtime. Not just from the battles, but what Robin did.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> He&#39;s been protecting the town without them ever knowing, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yeah. Robin Hood is a true hero.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> Aww, don&#39;t say that. I&#39;m not a hero even after death.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Aww, you should&#39;ve just told us.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> I&#39;ll admit I can be a bit of an oddball. But you&#39;ve got me all wrong, Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> I don&#39;t even remember the people in town. I just protect it because it&#39;s a nice place.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> I&#39;m not any different from the soldiers who attack the town. Just different tastes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Um, what does that mean?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> You know, I didn&#39;t want to go around crushing kids&#39; dreams. But I may as well say it.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> You guys talk about saving humanity, but that stuff&#39;s too big for me to really understand.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> I&#39;m a Servant? It got to be some kind of mistake.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> I was just a murderer with a rebel streak. I didn&#39;t save anything.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> But you saved the villagers.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> There are people you saved.</p><hr><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> That&#39;s just how things ended up. I fought alone, and the village was safe for a year or two.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> Sure, I fought the lord&#39;s army, but that doesn&#39;t mean I wanted to save anyone.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> You get it? I&#39;m just a thug and a coward. So be careful, Master.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> It&#39;s dangerous to let your guard down because of my good looks. I&#39;m a coward who&#39;ll run if he has to.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> Anyway, we&#39;re done hunting, so I&#39;ll be going. Might take a nap in the woods.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> Call me if there&#39;s a fight. It&#39;s my job, so I&#39;ll do whatever crazy things I have to.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...He&#39;s gone. But Robin contradicted himself.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> He said he protected the town because it was a nice place to be, but he sleeps in the forest.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I think he...I think he&#39;s keeping his distance from what&#39;s truly important to him.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Some guys are like that, Mash.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...It might be too important for him.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What does that mean... Hey, why are you smiling like that?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> If you know the answer, please tell me!
