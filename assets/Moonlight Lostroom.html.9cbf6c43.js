Fujimaru...?</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> Where did you go?</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> Perhaps I didn&#39;t do well as a Master?</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> Tell me! What does this mean!?</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> Was I asleep...?</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> It feels like I had a weird dream.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Can we continue now, Olga?</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> Lev...?</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> Y-Yeah... Go on.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> What is it?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s about the unknown location observed by CHALDEAS the other day, Director.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> That was it.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> It&#39;s an alarming situation indeed.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> At this rate, it will become a Singularity disturbing human history.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> I wonder if I should report this to the Association and the UN...</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> I believe it&#39;s too soon for that.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Maybe CHALDEAS isn&#39;t working properly.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> It&#39;s been eleven years since it began operations in 2004.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> How about trying a maintenance?</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> That won&#39;t do.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> CHALDEAS is a pseudo-celestial body copying the Earth&#39;s soul.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> Stopping CHALDEAS is the same as killing it.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> To begin with, my CHALDEAS lacks any imperfection.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> If it has a problem, the reason must be an external factor.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> An external factor...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Then, if CHALDEAS isn&#39;t at fault, the issue must be in the Observation Lens SHEBA.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Oh? It would be my fault if that&#39;s the case.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> It&#39;s true that my SHEBA has been working for 10 years.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Perhaps its theory isn&#39;t up to date.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> I never said I had complaints towards you, Lev!</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> There&#39;s the possibility of the staff in the Control Room overlooking something...</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> ...due to the Association harassing them all the time.</p><p><strong>Romani:</strong> The staff is completely healthy.</p><p><strong>Romani:</strong> If you ask me, the one who should take a day off is you, Director.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> I agree.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> You haven&#39;t been sleeping properly since we discovered this anomaly one week ago.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Let the doctors check your condition.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Aside from Leyshift experiment report, the report for the selection of Masters candidates is also finished.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So, please use the next twelve hours to rest as much as you can.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We don&#39;t have a replacemente for you, Director.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> Alright, I&#39;ll take your advice.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Speaking of rest, proffesor Lev must be sleeping well.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;ve heard that going to bed and waking up early it&#39;s healthy.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> That? Because my work was very exhausting before coming to Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Once I completed SHEBA, I stopped seeing dreams.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> That&#39;s why I can sleep soundly at night now.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> What about you, Romani?</p><p><strong>Romani:</strong> It&#39;s the opposite for me.</p><p><strong>Romani:</strong> Since I came here, all I see are dreams.</p><p><strong>Romani:</strong> But the dreams are always different.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> The Organization for the Preservation of Human Order, Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> An organization established by my father in order to ensure the future.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> The Animuspheres are a magi family that have studied the celestial bodies from long ago.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> The mission of this family, of the Animuspheres, is to establish the thesis of the Grand Order.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> That is, to guarantee the human history on this planet.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> We see into the future to ensure that human history will continue beyond the present.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> We don&#39;t aim for something big like &quot;creating the future.&quot;</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> Our mission is to guarantee that &quot;there is a future,&quot; and pass that onto other magi.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> For that reason, the Animusphere created this Mystic Code.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> Pseudo-Celestial Body, CHALDEAS.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> Assuming the planet had a soul, we copied that soul and put it inside this model of the Earth.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> But, we can&#39;t interfere with this second Earth.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> That&#39;s because its phase it&#39;s different.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> Still, it&#39;s possible to analyze it.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> My father configured CHALDEAS one hundred years into the future.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> As long as the light of civilization shines in CHALDEAS, we can assure the survival of humanity for the next one hundred years.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> At the same time, CHALDEAS works as a library of Earth.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> We can&#39;t observe in detail the future one hundred years ahead.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> Because the future is always changing.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> However, details of the confirmed past can be extracted.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> It&#39;s a compass pointing towards the past of humanity, so to speak.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> The success rate of sending someone to the past via Leyshifting after quantum decomposition...</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> ...raises dramatically thanks to CHALDEAS.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> My father founded Chaldea in order to observe and operate CHALDEAS.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> He was a great researcher and a great magus.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> That was my father... he left me alone after passing away three years ago.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> His dead body was found in his office, back in 2012.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> I don&#39;t even know if he had an accidental death or if he had an illness.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> I was just a little girl who took over Chaldea after his death.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> My father didn&#39;t leave me anything.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> But I did receive his conviction as a magus of Animusphere.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> It has been two years since I became Director.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> And just when I thought I was finally starting to get things done...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But, why one hundred years into the future?</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> What do you mean, Mashu?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I mean, if the only thing that matters is to see that civilization continues, why not set it to one day or one year after?</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> It&#39;s about response time, Mashu.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> If we set it to one day, there&#39;s nothing we can do if the light of civilization disappears.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> There&#39;s no solution.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> However, if the destruction comes one or ten years later, that&#39;s time enough to act.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> I believe the previous Director set it in one hundred years to give humanity enough time to prepare.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I see now.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The previous Director thought things through.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> B-But of course!</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> My father was a very prudent and thoughtful person!</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> He didn&#39;t act based on speculations nor wishful thinking.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> That&#39;s true.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> The Heroic Spirit Summoning System must be there for situations like that, too.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> If an abnormality emerged in the past, it would be impossible for us in the present to fix it.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> At least not if you don&#39;t go directly to that era to solve it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Even if Leyshift succeeds, you can only send a magus by himself.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Once in that location, there&#39;s no weapons to rely on.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> For that reason you need Heroic Spirits, the Servants.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Heroic Spirits exist as they&#39;re an extension of human history, in spite of how much it can change.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> By borrowing their power, you can hold your ground in any era.</p><p><strong>Romani:</strong> So, that&#39;s how it is.</p><p><strong>Romani:</strong> Heroic Spirits are spiritual phenomenons of higher order.</p><p><strong>Romani:</strong> The Throne of Heroes lies in a dimension above our own.</p><p><strong>Romani:</strong> They&#39;re beings that transcend time.</p><p><strong>Romani:</strong> Just like Chaldea, they&#39;re a security mechanism to protect The Human Order.</p><p><strong>Romani:</strong> Because, as long as you make a contract with them, they can be summoned into any era.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> The Heroic Spirit Summoning System isn&#39;t stable yet.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> And first we must secure those Master candidates with high Leyshift aptitude.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> I must make sure to verify that information...</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> I wish Da Vinci were more cooperative with our cause.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Olga, what about giving him... I mean, her, a workshop?</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> Not yet.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> I can&#39;t trust a Masterless Servant.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> Besides, I can&#39;t deal with that Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> Once we accomplish another summoning, I&#39;ll have her leave immediately.</p><p><strong>Romani:</strong> That&#39;s harsh.</p><p><strong>Romani:</strong> I&#39;ve heard Da Vinci-chan sees you as her little sister.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> We should leave Da Vinci in charge of the Heroic Spirit Summoning.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> So we can focus in the Masters selection.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Olga, are you done choosing the A-Team?</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> &quot;I recommend these seven magi if an emergency arises.&quot;</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> Those were the orders my father left.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> Father ordered to call them Crypters instead of Master candidates.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Director...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What&#39;s this?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It doesn&#39;t seem like it was made here in Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> That...</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> How weird... it was supposed to be under strict security measures.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> My apologies.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Is this something important?</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> Don&#39;t worry, we don&#39;t use it anymore.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> It&#39;s one of the presents from the Atlas Institute.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The Atlas Institute?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The ones who provided the blueprint for the TRISMEGISTUS....</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...resting at the core of Chaldea? Them?</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> The place where the definitive weapons of the world of magecraft are stored.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> The Pit of Taboo... The Atlas Institute.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> My father had a deal with Atlas, and based on it, they had to provide us with technology.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> That&#39;s how we got the Pseudo-Quantum Processor: TRISMEGISTUS.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> The other one was that...</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> The Imaginary Numbers Observation System: PAPER MOON.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> PAPER MOON...</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> A plane moon, perhaps?</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> It&#39;s my first time hearing of it.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> So, what does it do?</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> It&#39;s a compass that allows you to demonstrate and observe the Imaginary Numbers realm.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> It was prepared as a means to exceed CHALDEAS&#39; phase contrast.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> Although, it isn&#39;t need anymore.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> Because SHEBA was completed and we could accomplish Leyshifting.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m surprised.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> There is another way to interfere with Singularities besides Leyshifting?</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> By diving into the realm of Imaginary Numbers to later resurface in the appointed location.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> We called it Zero Sail.</p><p><strong>Romani:</strong> And the ship that made that possible was the Shadow Border. Keep the secret.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> I get it.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> There was a machine unused thanks to me finishing SHEBA.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> You got me there.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> I can&#39;t help but feel that I wasn&#39;t really needed.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> Lev...?</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> It&#39;s just a thought.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Maybe it&#39;s a bit sudden, but that&#39;s how things are.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Let&#39;s say it took me by surprise.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Olga, I completed the Near-Future Observation Lens SHEBA back in 1999.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> That&#39;s when I accepted Marisbilly&#39;s invitation.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> My destiny was determined at that moment.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> To save humanity...</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> No, that&#39;s wrong.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> To make this planet a better place.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> That became the goal of my life.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Before and after this incident.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> The future that humans build is versatile and keeps changing.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> That&#39;s why there&#39;s no stability.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Humanity&#39;s existence is wonderful, but they carry a big burden.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Wouldn&#39;t it be bad if it collapses like a mountain of pebbles?</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> That&#39;s exactly what I want to avoid.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> I can&#39;t do much by myself.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> But, at least I can stop one of those pebbles before crumbling.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> What about you?</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Do you want to be part of that big burden?</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Do you want to carry that burden?</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Or maybe you want to keep away those pebbles from your feet.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> I...</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> I&#39;m none of that.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> This big duty of preserving the Human Order only brings me anxiety.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> I don&#39;t give a damn about the future and its importance.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> All I have is this obsession to demonstrate that I&#39;m capable of doing it.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> Everyday is painful...</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> Everyday, there&#39;s no future...</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> What will I do once the end comes...?</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> Is there a way for me to be happy...?</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> I don&#39;t know at all what my purpose should be...</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> This is so...</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Oh, look at the time.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Pardon my discourtesy, but I&#39;ll be very busy from now on.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Are you Olga Marie?</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> My name is Lev Lainur, nice to meet you.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Oh? Without shaking hands?</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> It&#39;s fine, I like that attitude.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> It takes time to trust others.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> What? I dress weird?</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> It looks off?</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> But of course.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> I&#39;m the only here who dresses old-fashioned.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> It&#39;s my pride as a magus trying to display courtesy towards the history of the Animuspheres.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> This may be a modern place, but it&#39;s also the workshop of the Animuspheres.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> So, even if it&#39;s only me, it&#39;s natural to dress like a magus.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> Okay.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> Goodbye, Lev Lainur.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Good morning.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Are you in your break too, Senpai?</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong> I see everybody was here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;ll give you something to drink, what would you like?</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong> Only tea.</p><p><strong>Furjimaru:</strong> Excuse me.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> It&#39;s not like I&#39;m worried, but you look gloomy.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> Is there something bothering you?</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong> It&#39;s about my lack of skill.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> That&#39;s obvious.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> You were picked only to fill in numbers.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> You aren&#39;t a magus nor a soldier.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> Just an average joe.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> I&#39;d have never given you the chance to fight if you weren&#39;t the last remaining candidate.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> For you to receive such an important duty as protecting humanity&#39;s future is\u2013</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong> Even so...</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong> I can&#39;t keep getting saved by everyone else.</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong> First, I must get things done by myself.</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong> And I&#39;ve been working hard for it...</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> You...</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong> The more time passes, the more I realise how ordinary I am...</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong> It doesn&#39;t matter how much I train, or how many spells I learn...</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong> From time to time, I ask myself...</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong> &quot;Why me? I bet they have someone more qualified.&quot;</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong> That kind of unpleasant thought.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> Do you believe it was a mistake to become a Master?</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> You&#39;ve been doing it reluctantly because there&#39;s no one else to do it?</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> Good...</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> I should crush him now...</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong> Anyways.</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong> Those who don&#39;t even try are those who can&#39;t accomplish anything.</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong> If you can&#39;t get out of the situation...</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong> At least make yourself stronger.</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong> Even as an ordinary person, I&#39;ll be useless if I at least don&#39;t show off my mediocrity.</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong> I&#39;m not someone&#39;s substitute.</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong> I want to meet everyone&#39;s expectations by being myself.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> I&#39;m disappointed.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> How can we trust the future of humanity to such weakling?</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> The restoration of Human Order went to your head.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> Maybe my judgement was wrong.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Still, we made it this far thanks to you, Director.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We could complete Fuyuki&#39;s Order thanks to you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We were able to eliminate the Singularities in France, Rome and Okeanos...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...because you were our navigator.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> I did that with you...?</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> Mashu, what year is this...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s May 1st, 2016.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Director?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Are you feeling bad?</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> It&#39;s nothing.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> Thanks, Mashu.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> I regret not talking with you like this earlier.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> Will you keep going in spite of your fear?</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong> Well...</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong> I&#39;m not discouraged enough as to give up.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> Is that so?</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> There&#39;s nothing else for me to do, but I&#39;ll root for you anyways.</p><p><strong>Olga:</strong> Even if your future gets replaced by something completely hopeless.</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong> By the way...</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong> Who was that?</p><p><strong>Galahad:</strong> She&#39;s nobody.</p><p><strong>Galahad:</strong> She&#39;s someone who couldn&#39;t reach this future.</p><p><strong>Galahad:</strong> Give up.</p><p><strong>Galahad:</strong> There&#39;s no Human Order to protect anymore.</p><p><strong>Galahad:</strong> Listen, drifter who came from a faraway future... no, from the correct history.</p><p><strong>Galahad:</strong> You can&#39;t win.</p><p><strong>Galahad:</strong> The human world will be destroyed.</p><p><strong>Galahad:</strong> The future has already been decided.</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong> I knew of someone who said the same...</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong> But, that was just an empty theory.</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong> The future will always be a blank sheet as long as there&#39;s someone willing to fight!</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong> I won&#39;t let that happen!</p><p><strong>Galahad:</strong> You&#39;re right.</p><p>Because the future literally became a blank sheet. <strong>Galahad:</strong></p><p><strong>Galahad:</strong> It would be better if there were something to incinerate, because at least there would be something.</p><p><strong>Galahad:</strong> But, this planet even let go of that residue.</p><p><strong>Galahad:</strong> Humanity is at a stalemate.</p><p><strong>Galahad:</strong> This is the future one year from now that was decided once you stopped the Incineration of the Human Order.</p><p><strong>Galahad:</strong> This is how planet Earth looks.</p><p><strong>Galahad:</strong> The King of Magecraft once said...</p><p><strong>Galahad:</strong> &quot;You would be happier by not doing anything.&quot;</p><p><strong>Galahad:</strong> Let me repeat those words again.</p><p><strong>Galahad:</strong> Our history shall not continue onto the future.</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong> Because... we restored the Human Order...?</p><p><strong>Voice of Romani:</strong> Wake up, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong> Sorry!
