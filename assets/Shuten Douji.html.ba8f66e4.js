Perfect timing! Come over here, closer, if you would.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> I was just about to look for treats to go along with my drink. Come, sit next to me. Oh don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t bite.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Sure, I guess.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Yes, yes. It&#39;s good to be honest. What a good child you are.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Don&#39;t be afraid, you can sit closer to me. ...Oh fine, I will sit closer myself, fufufu.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...This is my room though.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Come on, don&#39;t worry about the details. We have a close relationship, right?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> What was it called? Master and Servant?</p><hr><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Oh, right. Is the girl with the glasses not with you? She&#39;s always hanging around you...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> I thought she might be your lover, but I guess I was wrong.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Well, it doesn&#39;t really matter, does it? Here, have a drink first.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m not old enough to drink.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Water&#39;s fine.</p><hr><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Oh my, oh my. You&#39;re no fun.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> The world&#39;s full of men who&#39;d love nothing more than for me to pour them a drink.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Are you still afraid of me? That hurts my maidenly heart.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Maidenly...heart?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> But those horns...</p><hr><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> I&#39;m sorry, my tongue slipped. I should really be mindful of what I say, no?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> ...But you know, isn&#39;t it a bit dull around here? We can&#39;t even go outside to gaze upon the moon, it seems.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> All I&#39;m good for is drinking and appreciating flowers. You understand why I&#39;d visit you, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You like flowers?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Well, my favorite thing is alcohol, followed by flowers, then pretty young men\u2014</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> I don&#39;t have a fourth favorite, and fifth is the moon, I suppose. I like things that please me, and pretty things.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That&#39;s very elegant.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Oh, how kind. But it&#39;s not like that.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> I don&#39;t read poems or write love letters, and being all formal in a palace is just so bothersome.</p><hr><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> ...Hmm? What&#39;s wrong? What&#39;s with that look?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> The oni of Mt. Ooe aren&#39;t really that special. I&#39;m just a girl who likes to drink.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> I do eat people, I suppose, but I&#39;m not as violent as Ura or Ootakemaru.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Well, an oni is an oni. I suppose we&#39;re not so different in the eyes of humans.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What exactly did you do before?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Hmm\u2014</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What kind of oni were you?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Fufufufufu. You&#39;re going to ask? Don&#39;t blame me if you regret it.</p><hr><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Very well, it&#39;s nothing I have to hide.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> I suppose, for someone like you, I could tell a couple stories.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Where should I begin...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Can I talk about after I returned to Japan? My memories before that are fuzzy.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Before returning?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> To Japan?</p><hr><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Oh, you didn&#39;t know? Long ago I lived on the continent\u2014</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Speaking of which, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve told anyone about that. No wonder it didn&#39;t get passed down.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Well, it doesn&#39;t matter. Anyway, some things happened and I came back to Japan.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> I wandered around Kyoto, around the rivers.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> And the next thing I knew I was drinking in a marvelous palace on Mt. Ooe.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> You see, it was Ibaraki... Ibaraki-Douji. She was considerate and showed me to the oni lair.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Oni were probably the ones who built that palace. It was quite a sight, up on that mountain.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> After that, I had such a wonderful time.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> I drank whenever I desired, and I loved whatever I desired.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> I ventured to Kyoto whenever I felt like it, and killed, ate, and plundered, as I pleased.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> I took what I liked back to the mountain.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Flowers, the moon, handsome men, pretty women, rare jewels, fabrics, pots... I loved all of them.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...You killed people?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Here and there.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...It sounds like you had fun.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Of course I did. I&#39;m an oni.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> I rampage, love, laugh to my heart&#39;s content without a shred of worry or doubt.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> That&#39;s what I am, an oni. Humans like that kind of stuff too, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> It was so much fun, but it didn&#39;t last long.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> The nobles and onmyouji of Kyoto got very mad.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> They sent the famous Minamoto-no-Raikou, the next head of the Minamoto clan, and Raikou&#39;s Four Heavenly Kings after me\u2014</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> \u2014Ah yes, that was a terribly amusing night.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> I&#39;d been after him for a while. That boy with blonde hair and blue eyes... And then he came for me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Sakata Kintoki?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Yes, that&#39;s right. Him. The one they called Kintoki.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> It&#39;s strange, isn&#39;t it? He moved up in the world after he became famous through stories. As if he was a Shogi piece.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Golden?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Right. What&#39;s with that? He was a cute kid, and now he&#39;s even cuter, you know?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> In life he was reviled for his blonde hair. Here people just think he&#39;s a fan of Western culture.</p><hr><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> ...Hahh. When I look at his body, I remember.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> If I&#39;d pulled it off that night, I could&#39;ve put the Red Dragon&#39;s ulna in my wine.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> What would it have tasted like, I wonder? I&#39;d love to drink it.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> But that night, they beat me. They won the fight and killed me.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> They gave me poisoned wine\u2014</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> And well, I got drunk, and that was it.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> The divine poisoned wine, Shinpen Kidoku! With an excellent wine like that, of course I&#39;d get drunk!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...They attacked while you slept, huh?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Indeed. I was having a nice nap, and off went my head.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> I still remember his face when he did it. He looked like he couldn&#39;t bear with it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Does it still bother you?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Huh?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Not really? I&#39;m mostly impressed they managed to do it.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> I killed and ate humans. It&#39;s natural that I&#39;d be killed in turn.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> I may be a little ditzy, but I don&#39;t forget when I&#39;ve embarrassed myself.</p><hr><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> \u2014Oh, but... I wish I could&#39;ve seen those blue eyes once more.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Looks like you&#39;re daydreaming now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Did you love him?</p><hr><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Oh, my. Are you saying that because...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> You&#39;re jealous when I speak of another man?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Fufufufufu. Instead of fearing the oni of Mt. Ooe, you&#39;re getting jealous. You&#39;ve got guts. I&#39;m impressed.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> ...Come, move closer. Why don&#39;t I take this chance to teach you a few things?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Teach me?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What?</p><hr><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> Hey, how&#39;s the training coming, Boss? I take it everything is going well? I&#39;ll tag along\u2014</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Oh my. Speak of the devil, huh? What a coincidence.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> Sorry, Boss. Gotta run! Just remembered I didn&#39;t eat breakfast!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Wait just a minute. You&#39;re making it a little too obvious.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> Hey, don&#39;t grab my collar! I&#39;m not a cat! You&#39;ll wrinkle it!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> You&#39;re not a cat, you&#39;re a tiger.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> You think you can just come in here when I&#39;m in the mood, and then ignore me and leave?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> I-I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re in the mood for, but it takes too much energy to deal with you this early!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> You&#39;re still as naive as ever. All right, I have an idea.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> The perfect way to liven up my drinking\u2014</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> ...There&#39;s a good way for the three of us to all work up a sweat together. How about it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Work up a sweat?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Together?</p><hr><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> Are you stupid!? If you want to do stuff like that, you need to... um... yeah...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> Do stuff! You know! Like it&#39;s gotta be at night, right?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Right, right. Look into my eyes and say that.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> I am! You just can&#39;t tell because of my shades!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> ...Tch. I mean for one thing, you shouldn&#39;t just strut around with such revealing\u2013</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Yoink.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> Waah!?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Quiet. Okay, let&#39;s go.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh? Senpai? And Shuten and Kintoki?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What&#39;s wrong? Kintoki looks really upset...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Shuten-Douji is...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, Shuten-Douji is what?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Mash, perfect timing.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. If it&#39;s perfect timing for you, it&#39;s perfect for me, too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I mean, um, what are you doing in the Command Room? We&#39;re adjusting the equipment...</p><hr><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> You&#39;ve got that thing. The see-mu-lay-tor, was it? We&#39;re borrowing it for a bit.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Hmm? You want to use the combat simulator? We can&#39;t Rayshift because we&#39;re still adjusting the equipment, but that should be fine.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Seeing you together had me worried for a bit, but you&#39;re not fighting, are you?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> We&#39;re not fighting, but\u2014 Wait! Is that what you meant by working up a sweat?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Working up a sweat?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Hahahaha. What did you think I meant? You were talking about training, so I agreed to help.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> And I really am feeling in the mood. I need to smash some things to calm down.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Will you come with me? You, Master, and Mash, too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> If Senpai wants me...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I guess I have no choice.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Morning workout time!</p><hr><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> That&#39;s right. That&#39;s what I want to hear. You really are my type.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Come, child. Let&#39;s work hard. As hard as you possibly can.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> \u2014Be ready to kill, please.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> It&#39;s been so long since we&#39;ve met. I want you and me to be more... more, more, more, more...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Covered in sweat... and covered in blood...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Until you can&#39;t tell flesh and bone apart... Come at me at full strength...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> I want a deathmatch in that ephemeral world.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> ...Sheesh. You really have a frightening mind.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> You&#39;re a Servant, at least in theory. I thought you&#39;d turned into something more ladylike...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> But I guess I didn&#39;t need to worry! Okay, time to snap off your horns and make you cry!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Hahaha. Splendid, splendid. Come join us, Master.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Regardless of how he looks, he&#39;s as tough as a bear. Let&#39;s fight him, hand in hand!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> Didn&#39;t think I&#39;d see you fight next to a human!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> Wait, are you really drunk? Maybe seeing doubles or triples of me?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> Fine. Come and get me! I&#39;ll give you a golden wake-up call!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (Wait, we&#39;re helping her, huh? No, if you&#39;re fighting, so am I!)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Let&#39;s keep this from getting out of hand.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Let&#39;s try not to die.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (Right, Master!)</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> You&#39;ve got guts. Nothing less from the hunk I had my eyes on.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> I think this&#39;ll be fun. Doctor, lend me your ear.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> (Psst... You can do this, right? I know you can. I&#39;ve heard you&#39;re VERY talented.)</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...Your breathiness, your words, the way you move, it&#39;s all really sexy!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I guess I can&#39;t help it if I&#39;m giving in to your temptations!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Okay, leave it to me! You want mass-produced Kintokis, you got &#39;em!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> Huh!? What are you talking about? Hey, that ain&#39;t fair, Shuten!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Thank you so much\u2606 I&#39;ll pay you back later with a drink, okay?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Now\u2014 Let the party begin! Be consumed by drunkenness, madness, and excitement! Everything starts after that!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> Damn! You&#39;re tiny but you hit hard! I guess you haven&#39;t forgotten a thing, huh?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Of course not! I&#39;m an oni to my core. Do you think I&#39;d fight a war I couldn&#39;t win?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> You&#39;re still as strong as I remember, though... If I let my guard down you&#39;ll split me right into two...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> That makes me happy. You&#39;re hitting me with your real strength.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> But... This isn&#39;t enough for me.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Let&#39;s stop fighting like little kids. I want you to come at me in a way that&#39;s more...grown-up.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (Huh!?)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Kintoki&#39;s pretty strong already.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (Y-Yeah... He seems fiercer than usual today.)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I see a second fight coming.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (Yes. I can&#39;t see this just ending. There&#39;ll probably be at least one more fight.)</p><hr><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> ...You really haven&#39;t changed, have ya? No matter how much time passes, you&#39;re still the same.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> I&#39;m a classic, not some passing fad. And as for you...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Your appearance has changed, but your heart hasn&#39;t. You&#39;re still the little kid you used to be.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> You&#39;re holding back. Is it because you&#39;re that afraid to hit a woman?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> I don&#39;t mind. Be fiercer. More violent.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> If you want more of a fight, let&#39;s bring out the bears!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> BEARS!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Right, right. Bears. Hmm... Yeah, I&#39;ve got bears.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (He&#39;s got bears!?)</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Let&#39;s get back to it. I&#39;ll melt both you and the bears.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> But don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll lap up all your blood before it touches the ground.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> Hah, I&#39;m not so out of it that I&#39;ll let you eat me! I&#39;ll take your head, and use my own blood as lipstick on it!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Ahahahaha! I like that! It sounds so elegant!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> To have you put funeral makeup on me would be so wonderful and I bet that idiot Raikou would grow horns from hearing it!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Simulation complete. Both have only suffered minor damage to their Spirit Cores.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Also, um... Those were soul eaters. Not bears.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It said they were bears.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The Doctor was being silly. Doctor, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a good idea.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Sorry, I was getting too into it... But I think it was the only way to calm down Shuten-Douji.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> She may look refined, but she&#39;s the most brutal oni of them all.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> She might&#39;ve attacked Fujimaru if she got bored.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;m just glad everyone&#39;s alive.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, you&#39;re right. Both of them were extremely agitated...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But I&#39;m glad we made it back safe. Good work, Senpai.</p><hr><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Fufu, that was fun. Thank you both, Mash, Master.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> You played along with my little game. Such good, good children you are. Lovely.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> And you too, of course, sweaty little boy. That was quite the invective for being impromptu.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> I bet you could&#39;ve taught those nobles in Kyoto a thing or two about plays.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> I&#39;m never reading poems or haikus again. Bikes are the big thing now.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> ...Sigh. Damn it, I got all worked up. You look unconcerned as ever... You were just toying with me, huh?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> How much of what you say is just an act? Crap, I&#39;m so tired...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Fufufufufufu. How much is an act?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Of course, I&#39;m always serious.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> ...R-Right.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Fufufu. You&#39;re still a kid. Even though you&#39;re SUCH a big and handsome man.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Fighting for your life while drunk, outwitting your opponent while pressing your body against theirs... Now that&#39;s amusing.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> \u2014Don&#39;t you think so, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> R-Right.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I-I didn&#39;t think you&#39;d ask me.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> S-Senpai is panicking! Hang in there!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Wow. In the face of a drunk Shuten-Douji, Heroic Spirits and their Master are all nothing but playthings.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s just how oni are, or just how she is, though.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Yeah. I-I&#39;ll do my best, too...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Yeah, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s necessary. Actually, let&#39;s just get back to work. Yeah.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Hehehe. Hang in there, kid.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> Grrr!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Playthings...</p><h2 id="so-i-ll-remain-myself-whether-i-m-drunk-crazed-or-seething-and-sneering" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#so-i-ll-remain-myself-whether-i-m-drunk-crazed-or-seething-and-sneering" aria-hidden="true">#</a> So I&#39;ll Remain Myself Whether I&#39;m Drunk, Crazed, or Seething and Sneering</h2>',279),p={href:"https://redd.it/iswjnl",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},l=u("JP interlude Translated by Konchew");function d(m,y){const o=e("ExternalLinkIcon");return r(),s("div",null,[g,t("ul",null,[t("li",null,[t("a",p,[l,a(o)])])])])}var f=n(h,[["render",d],["__file","Shuten Douji.html.vue"]]);export{f as default};
