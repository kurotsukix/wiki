This town lacks something. What do you think it is?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Smiles.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Happiness.</p><hr><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Exactly! The world is a stage, and the men and women coming and going on it are performers.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Regardless, there is no smile in this town. No happiness. Why is that\u2013?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> It&#39;s because there is no drama! If so, shall we put up an improv for people to see?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> An improv? ...And you said &quot;we.&quot;... By &quot;we&quot;, you mean...</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Why, of course I mean myself, Mash Kyrielight, and Master Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I-Impossible! I&#39;ve never seen or performed a play!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Oh, you haven&#39;t?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Y-Yes. I&#39;m sorry for my inexperience... But there was never any need for me to...</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Hahaha, what are you talking about? That need is more apparent than ever for you!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> What you need right now is love, words and poetry! A kindled passion is exactly what you need!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ohhhh, but...</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Oh, and a shield and weapon, too. It&#39;s kind of sudden, I know\u2013</p><p><strong>Citizen:</strong> Monsters! Monsters are coming\u2013!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> But monsters are coming all of a sudden, you see!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> W-Why is that\u2013?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> W-We should deal with them.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Let&#39;s protect everyone!</p><hr><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Oh, what a courageous line! But I wish you&#39;d made your delivery a bit more complex.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> &quot;Hear your death bell ringing! Are you going to heaven, or to hell!&quot; ...How about that?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Uh, excuse me. Please join the battle!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Oh, how valorous you were. You are majestic even when standing behind me, Master.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Well, the Holy Grail War is a fine thing. It&#39;s a war that contains elements common to historical plays, tragedy and comedy!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m...glad to hear that.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> See, hear the thunderous applause.</p><p><strong>Citizen:</strong> You were so cool, kid!</p><p><strong>Citizen:</strong> I love you, let&#39;s make a baby!</p><p><strong>Citizen:</strong> Who&#39;s giving out the orders behind that girl... A king, emperor, or a general...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Wh-Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> L-Let&#39;s get going, Master!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> I wish I could work out the lines a little more there...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Give me a break...!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Well, it&#39;s important to select words with care. I hope you&#39;ll work harder next time.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Wh-What? Did you say\u2013Next time?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Yes. Listen, Mash, Master.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> You two are the protagonists of this play. A girl and her master rise up to save this town.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> The girl is a steel knight with a fragile heart. The master is a vulnerable human with a steel heart.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> By going hand in hand, the two characters begin to transform from craven to courageous.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> And standing in their way\u2013</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Are diabolical beasts beyond human understanding. Unable to communicate, they are incompatible.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Their sad existence is fated to be hostile to humans. By delivering the final blow, the two heroes are able to move on.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> It is a treacherous path denying them even sleep, the one balm for their wounded bodies and souls.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Regardless, they have no regret, despair, or resignation.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Even if what they fight against is the great existence constituting the framework of the universe\u2013</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> You two shall march onward!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Excuse me, but I have one question.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Sure, what is it?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Sorry if I&#39;m wrong, but are you summoning those enemies\u2013?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> ...Well! It&#39;s time to fight, Master!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Answer my question!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (panting...)</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> And now it&#39;s time for the climax!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Uh, are you sure you didn&#39;t summon them? With the power a Caster might use, maybe?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Sorry, but I&#39;m not skilled in magecraft at all. I&#39;m a writer, after all.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Right. You do have a point there\u2013</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Anyway, there&#39;s a villain who&#39;s feeling frustrated. Let&#39;s say, his initial is &#39;S.&#39;</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> S? Um, Mr. Shakespeare? So it is you\u2013</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> The villain named S grows impatient with the town&#39;s neverending peace, curses the people, and to top it all off, he comes up with a plot!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> It was to use the townspeople! To incite the townspeople, and turn them into daemons so he can make them attack our heroes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What!? Shakespeare, is that\u2013!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No way...!?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> They have no people to protect, no friends to share laughter with.All they do now is shiver with loneliness\u2013</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> &quot;You can give in.&quot; The demon whispers. &quot;You can rest now.&quot; The nightmare murmurs.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Well, well, well, what are you going to do, Mash Kyrielight? Indeed, what are you going to do, Fujimaru\u2013My Master!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ugh... Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> We are such stuff as dreams are made on.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Ha! I didn&#39;t expect that answer!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> It essentially means transience, that everything you struggle for in life is merely what happens in your dream.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> But, however\u2013you are different. You&#39;ve perceived a different meaning in it.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> A dream is hope. Hope is what is laid with courage and determination.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Then, your battle speaks for itself. For you are the dream!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I don&#39;t care about philosophy.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Heheheh, I knew you&#39;d say that! What you just said is absolutely true, Master!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> A demon&#39;s whisper, reasonable conclusion, and compelling valid argument.All those kinds of things\u2013</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> You&#39;re welcome to get over them simply by saying, &quot;I don&#39;t care!&quot;</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Because it is evil in the name of a valid argument. It is a cowardly trick trying to camouflage the evil with a facade called theory.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Just go ahead and do it!</p><hr><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> You are great, Master. You are fantastic and invincible!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Yes. He&#39;s absolutely right, Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I have no doubts. If there&#39;s no way to turn them back, we just need to defeat them.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m coming with you, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We defeated them...!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Oh, we must hail your victory! ...Now that they won the battle, the end of their dream comes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh\u2013?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> O-Oh? The town...is gone!?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Excellent job, Master. And you, Mash Kyrielight...the shield and sword.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> The dream is now over. You gathered the beautiful threads of your story.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Now, let&#39;s walk toward the rest of the story. I am certain the transient dream and illusion shall satiate your mind.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> ...And of course, for me, too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> From...where to where was it a dream...?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> \u2013Heheheh. Of course, that&#39;s a secret. Playwrights never reveal their methods so easily.</p>',107),n=[o];function h(p,i){return t(),s("div",null,n)}var l=e(a,[["render",h],["__file","William Shakespeare.html.vue"]]);export{l as default};
