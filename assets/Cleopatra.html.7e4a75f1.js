As ever, you have that sad puppy look on your face, Master!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> But that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a bad thing. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, after all. Everything is!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Besides, it&#39;s the common crossbreed pups with that doe-eyed sad look who stop passersby at the pet shop windows.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Too many expensive breeds with bright eyes and shining coats could intimidate people passing by!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> That&#39;s why you shouldn&#39;t feel ashamed and actually be proud of being a hot ticket item.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> After all, no matter how much you flail about, you can never change the essence of who you are.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> O-okay... To be honest, I do not really understand what you&#39;re saying.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But anyway... Welcome, Cleopatra.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You are quite the beauty today, as usual.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Tee hee. I tire of such praise. You&#39;re only stating the obvious, you know.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> But at least you never fail to acknowledge those around you. Let&#39;s go eat some fruit together later.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Hello.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> You have the gall to address me like a mere friend!? I should be adored like the queen that I am! This is a disgrace that I, Cleopatra VII, have never experienced!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Such disrespect! And yet how refreshing! Whatever should I do!? What kind of reward would you like, for offering such new experience to me!?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So, Cleopatra, we seldom see you around here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What brings you here today?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> ...? But you just mentioned my reason for being here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Wha...?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> ...(Sigh) I suppose I&#39;ll have to spell it out for you, won&#39;t I?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> As a special favor to you, I&#39;ll explain everything. Clear as day.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Listen. It&#39;s been quite a while since I was summoned here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Right.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I use your fighting technique all the time.</p><hr><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> But I realized that I had forgotten something crucial.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> It&#39;s something that should have been done much earlier, and I feel that failing to do so has caused certain complications to arise.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...What is it?</p><hr><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> ... You do realize that you summoned me, the ultimate beauty of the world, Cleopatra VII Philopator, right?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> And thus, I am able to make time, without any warning, and without opening up anyone&#39;s schedule and do this...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Which means, there&#39;s only one thing to do...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> We must have a photo shoot!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> !?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I-I&#39;m sorry, Cleopatra. I don&#39;t quite follow...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> What was unclear in what I said?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> I can&#39;t imagine I need to explain what a photo shoot is, do I?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> I do not visit Master&#39;s room that often...so I wish to immortalize this moment with a photo shoot!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> If you still don&#39;t understand now, then you will just have to come and see for yourself.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Now come, Master. It&#39;s time to head out!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> A professional photo shoot obviously requires a talented photographer. We must first recruit a cameraman!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, wait, Cleopatra! Cleopatra!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> There&#39;s no use arguing. Let&#39;s go.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I suppose we can&#39;t just leave her alone like this. Who knows what she has in mind, though...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> All right, Senpai. After you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Let&#39;s play along. Sounds like fun.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Fun...? Do you think so...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Either way, we can&#39;t just leave Cleopatra to her devices. All right, Senpai. After you.</p><hr><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> You should be honored. You have been selected as the gifted artisan who will immortalize my beauty!</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> ...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I-I&#39;m terribly sorry, Georgios.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m sure Cleopatra&#39;s beautiful, wonderful greeting has you so dumbfounded that you&#39;ve just stopped in your tracks, and can think of nothing to say.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Allow me to explain what she was talking about.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> She is asking you to be her photographer, Georgios.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Well, if it isn&#39;t Master and Mash.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> I see...so you seek my talent.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> If that is what you require, I&#39;d be happy to accept... But I was actually on my way to the Saints&#39; Club...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Saints&#39; Club?</p><hr><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> As the name entails, it is a meeting of the saints here in Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> There&#39;s no official agenda, but I believe there is a purpose for me in joining such a club.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Yes... For example, should a saintly woman with excessive strength start shadow boxing all of a sudden...</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Or should a mysterious, saint-like individual from the Far East chuckle menacingly...</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Or if a precocious young saint asks where babies come from...</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Or if a dark saintly woman who shows contempt for sainthood mistakenly gets captured on film...</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> When such a time comes, I will need to be present. Oh, my Lord...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Y-you seem to have it tough...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Then this is exactly the time you&#39;re waiting for!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Unlike that obscure and unfulfilling labor that you mentioned, the job that I am requesting you to do is quite simple. Rewarding. Coveted, in fact.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> In better times, my worshippers (read: fans) would have desired even the tiniest reminder of my beauty to keep and gaze upon lovingly in their homes...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> And they would have gladly waited in long lines carrying their expensive memory-preserving machines that were purchased with their life savings!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> As I said, you are being freely offered this great honor. You have no cause to hesitate!</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Yes, but I am not hesitating.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> I have prior commitments, and who knows what kind of hellish scene the Saints&#39; Club may be without me there.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Ungh... He cannot seem to grasp my simple logic. Even a child would have understood. He really must not know a thing about beauty.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> He must have lived an abstentious life, which led to him forgetting what it even means to love beauty.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> So obsessed with sainthood. How sad...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Well, he IS a saint...</p><hr><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> It&#39;s fine. I have found our directive.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> The reason why this man is not accepting the honor of being my photographer is because he is a sad, sad man who does not appreciate beauty.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> In order to regain such appreciation, words will not suffice. Rather, he needs a shock to his system to free him of his silly notions.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Yes...yes. If that is what is needed, then we have no choice.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> I shall personally beat an appreciation of beauty into this man! My own beauty knows no parallel, after all!</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> ...Mm, what do you mean by \u201Cpersonally\u201D?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Georgios! What is that expression on your face!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It looks like he&#39;s imagining something unsaintly!</p><hr><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Hm? What do you mean, \u201Cunsaintly\u201D? I was just going to show that nincompoop what beauty is with my body...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> There...there is absolutely no way I would have shown my skin to a man I do not love!!!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> People may have called me a seductress who manipulated men to further her country&#39;s interests...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> But I did what I did because I fell in love with all those handsome men!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> ...Ahem. I digress. It&#39;s hard to convey your true feelings to others...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Let&#39;s try this again, without any misunderstandings. Let&#39;s demonstrate with actions, not with words.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Basically, I&#39;m going to beat a sense of beauty back into you myself!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Brace yourself, saintly photographer!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> You&#39;ll take the job? You said you&#39;ll take the job, right? Ohoho, you should have said so from the get-go!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Are you sure about this?</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Yes. If she needs me that much, I cannot refuse.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> To be honest, her dazzling form was quite blinding. In fact, I was nearly blinded several times.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Georgios...does that mean...are you actually blind now...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What about the Saints&#39; Club?</p><hr><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> I&#39;ve arranged it so that King David will be there as a special guest.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> He has many moving stories to tell. He has the power to make his listeners go into a trance. So he should be able to carry the meeting for now.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> How the other saints will listen and react to King David&#39;s story is intriguing in itself...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But everything has been arranged. Now let us head to this photography session...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> (Gasp!) No, I forgot one other crucial detail!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Now what!?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> The background! There is absolutely no way we are doing a shoot in this dingy cave!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> ...Actually, I wonder why the Saints&#39; Club meets in a place like this. But let&#39;s leave that aside for now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It&#39;s about the shooting site, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Exactly. Of course my Master could figure that out. I want a photo shoot to match a Hollywood star!</p><hr><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> If my beauty is to be preserved in a photo, there must also be a suitable background!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> So there you have it. Let&#39;s continue our Rayshifting in search of the perfect background for the shoot!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Mash, go ahead with the preparations! If you&#39;re shorthanded, use all of Chaldea&#39;s staff!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> There&#39;s no need to pay them extra for this! The privilege of looking upon me is reward enough!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Oh, but my bright and dazzling form will cause some of the staff to go blind. I guess I would have to offer them extra pay to compensate them.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (Why can&#39;t she just agree to pay them part-time wages?)</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Well, basically everything she&#39;s doing just shouts \u201CCleopatra\u201D...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Anyway, it appears that I need to make some preparations.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m going to grin and bear it and help out in Cleopatra&#39;s photo shoot!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Hm. Now that I&#39;ve connected the instant photo processing device specially made by Da Vinci...</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Okay. Not bad. Here&#39;s how it turned out... What do you think?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Hmmm. Not...terrible... Maybe it&#39;s that I&#39;m alone...maybe it&#39;ll be different when we do the shoot for real...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> She seems to be muttering about something. I think she&#39;s being particular at something, but I can only imagine how high her standards must be.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Master? Come over here. Next to me.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Yes. Direct your face over there...just like that. Got it? Now don&#39;t move. Come on, photographer, take it now!</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Moving on to taking the two of you? Understood. Three, two, one... Say \u201Ccheese.\u201D</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> What do you think?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Honestly, it&#39;s bad. One subject totally outshines the other.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (I&#39;m sorry...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (This is what happens when an ordinary Masterpairs up with the world&#39;s greatest beauty...)</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> N-no, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s true! I like this photo...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So there&#39;s no need to be so disappointed...!</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> If the client is not satisfied, I fail as a photographer. I can retake as many as needed.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> We obviously need a reshoot. Maybe the background just isn&#39;t working.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> If the photo&#39;s not turning out right even after so many takes, maybe we&#39;re just in the wrong place. Let&#39;s head to a different location!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Unacceptable! You say there&#39;s something lacking, but I say EVERYTHING&#39;S lacking!</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Ugh...!</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> I may be able to retaliate should the comment just be an emotional outburst, but this is coming from a pharaoh who left her mark on history.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Even I know that this photograph does not accentuate the subject matter to its true potential.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> I cannot call myself a photographer and say this is my best work!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Those two are very serious. It&#39;s like a heated battle of some sort.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s fine, but why do I need to be in the photos?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (The question is whether Master&#39;s psyche can withstand every photo that gets criticized.)</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Now, I would like to do another shoot, but we&#39;re starting to lose the light.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Isn&#39;t there anything you can do?</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> I never imagined that this photo session would take so long...and go to so many different places...</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> This problem would be solved if we just had a reflector, but I didn&#39;t bring one this time.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> This oversight is absolutely my fault. I&#39;m terribly sorry.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Reflexer?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No, Master. He means a reflector, a device that redirects light...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> During a photo shoot, it can adjust the intensity and direction of the subject&#39;s lighting.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I hear that photographers have many uses for them.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> It&#39;s exactly as Mash explained. What I need right now is a white reflector.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Hm. Maybe I should go back and retrieve it... Well, some white cloth might get the job done, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> A white cloth... Is there one around here?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t have one, either.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> There couldn&#39;t be one just conveniently lying around...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> !?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Y-you&#39;re...!?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> ...A-ahem.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> I am...a mysterious...Medjed-looking...being. You...two. Come...here...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> A-am I dreaming!? Is a life-sized Medjed talking to me!?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> ...And where are you taking Master and Mash!?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Are you going to give just the two of them some kind of special protection or something!? I&#39;m almost jealous!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ummm, what are you doing here, Nito\u2013</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> Shhhh!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> ...(Whisper, whisper)...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> O-okay. You&#39;re saying that even though you prepared a swimsuit, you couldn&#39;t go swimming much in it...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> And so you came here to this beach to try to make use of that swimsuit...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But that&#39;s not a very regal thing to do, so you don&#39;t want us to let Cleopatra know you&#39;re here.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> And so...right now...I am not...this Nito-something. Under...stand?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Y-yes...so you just want us to keep this a secret. Understood.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Now that I think back, Cleopatra wasn&#39;t around during the summer races...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Wasn&#39;t she on her honeymoon?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Wasn&#39;t she stalking Caesar?</p><hr><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Hey, over there! How long are you going to be chatting behind my back?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> It would be nice if you would introduce me to this person with the exceptionally godly aura!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> I...am. Just a...god...who&#39;s passing...by. Nice to...meet you...Cleopatra...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> My...what wonderful manners! And it is quite knowledgeable.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> But then, it is the great Medjed! I knew you would know my name...!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Oh...this is the first time I&#39;ve spoken with the great Medjed, so I&#39;m a bit nervous!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> My heart is racing like the first time I met Caesar... Could this be...love...?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Ugh...but the great Medjed possesses beauty that could even stand alongside my own unabashed!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> I mustn&#39;t take a photograph now...not with such greatness present. I know better than to show disrespect before a god.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> By...the way. What...were you...doing? Photo...graph...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You see...</p><hr><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> ...That&#39;s what happened. These are the photos we have taken so far.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Unfortunately, none of these have met with my client&#39;s satisfaction.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> Hm...I...see...</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> I see...what her...intent...her purpose...is. Then...I shall...assist...</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> If you need...something white...I can...be...of help...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> The great Medjed is going to act as a reflector!? We are not worthy!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> But this may be what is necessary to make my special photo shoot worthy! Ah, what a conundrum!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> How...ever... It comes...with a...price.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> Show me...your beauty... Do so...and I will...help.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> I&#39;m thrilled that you will help us out, but...whatever do you mean?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That is a fair question. Let me ask. U-um...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> \u201CLook at me. If I helped freely, appreciation of the great Medjed would diminish.\u201D</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...That was Medjed&#39;s response.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> I see. I understand.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> This is a trial. I am being given a divine revelation saying I am to receive the blessings of Medjed, and that I shouldn&#39;t be satisfied with my current state, and that I must continue pursuing beauty further!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> ...Then I shall happily undertake this trial!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> If you would, please move a bit more to the right. Yes, right there. The lighting is just perfect.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Now here we go. Say \u201Ccheese.\u201D</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Wait, how come I&#39;m in this picture, too?</p><hr><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Hm, what do you think? I believe this is one of our best yet.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Yes. There&#39;s nothing wrong with the photo. But...</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> You&#39;re still not satisfied?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> No... You know what, we should try thinking about this differently.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> If we&#39;re not getting the result we want even after all these attempts, it means we&#39;re not lacking something... But maybe there&#39;s something...conflicting...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> The issue is...pinpointing what exactly it is.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;m in it...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Maybe it&#39;s better if it&#39;s just Cleopatra...</p><hr><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Nonsense. If that were true, there would be no point in this endeavor in the first place.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> The key...is...the point...of this...endeavor...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> ...!?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Yes. You&#39;re right. Great Medjed, you read me like a book.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> We should have never tried to match the background to me.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> The most beautiful subject in this photo is undoubtedly me, but I should not be the photo&#39;s focus.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Then I will focus on matching the background with the main subject. Let me ask you, Master.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> What backdrop do you think would be the most fitting for you?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Well, I didn&#39;t think it was going quite this way...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But I believe you just have to think of the most fitting place for a photo shoot, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Where would that be? I will go wherever you like.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Hmmmm, let&#39;s see...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Eh? This is Chaldea&#39;s Command Room... Here?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Of course. Let&#39;s take it with everyone else too.</p><hr><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> If you insist, then I don&#39;t mind letting the other staff members join in. But why here?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m here thanks to everyone&#39;s efforts.</p><hr><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> So that&#39;s why you think this is the most fitting backdrop for you. ...Well, that&#39;s fine.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Then let&#39;s see how this one goes. I want everyone to get closer to the middle, closer to Master.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Yes. That&#39;s it. Here we go...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Let me see how it turned out.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> ...I see. So this is how it was supposed to be.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> This is fine. I believe it turned out splendidly.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I inadvertently got into the picture next to Senpai, too...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But it looks like this photograph has finally satisfied Cleopatra.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Yes. I&#39;m satisfied. Now take a look at this picture, Master. Now do you understand?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> About, what?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;m sorry I still don&#39;t understand...</p><hr><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> ...Do I have to spell everything out for you? Don&#39;t you get it?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> This is a picture that encapsulates my eternal beauty, alongside you...who are also beautiful.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Weren&#39;t you always saying that it was ill-matched the whole time?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> I was never talking about the matchup between Master and me.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> My captivating beauty, and while [\u2642 his /\u2640\uFE0F hers} could never be a match for mine, my beautiful Master...and a background that embraces the two subjects.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> That was what was badly matched.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Eh? But I don&#39;t think I&#39;m beautiful...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...No, Senpai. If you look at that photograph, Cleopatra and I are both in agreement.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This photograph taken in the Command Room with you, Cleopatra, and all the staff...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Everyone&#39;s smiling...and in the center of all that, you&#39;re smiling, too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m not able to properly put it into words, but the photo has a very warm feel, and it&#39;s dazzling.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> You&#39;ve always been like that, Master. From the moment you summoned me, to be exact.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> But...it seemed like you yourself didn&#39;t realize it.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> And so I thought, if you had just one photograph of yourself standing beside me, you would realize just how beautiful you are...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> And yes, you would understand. That&#39;s what I thought.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Hm... So you went through all this trouble just so you could make Master realize that.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Not exactly. That was just the process. What I truly want to tell Master is beyond that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ???</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> You said it right from the beginning, Mash. I rarely visit My Room. And that&#39;s the problem.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> What I mean is...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> WHY DON&#39;T YOU INVITE ME OVER MORE OFTEN?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Yes, it seems Master is afraid of me, or is keeping [\u2642 his /\u2640\uFE0F her} distance from me out of reverence.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> It&#39;s true that I am a beautiful pharaoh. There is obviously a great disparity between our ranks, so being somewhat intimidated is understandable.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> But that should not matter. Take a look at the photograph once again.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> You can see the beautiful Cleopatra and...and the less beautiful, but still very beautiful Master.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> So, you should have more confidence! At the very least, know that I have absolute confidence in myself.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Which means...no matter how plain they look or how boring they act, a human who is able to summon someone as beautiful as me must surely be beautiful!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s...true. Self-centered and maybe unfounded, but true, Cleopatra...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But I think the thought behind it is meant to be complimentary to Master...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Or rather, now that I think back, perhaps it&#39;s always been that way...?</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Hm. A truly noble beauty like her may only be able to compliment people...</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> ...in roundabout ways that are bound to sometimes lead to misunderstandings.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Listen, Fujimaru. I know very well that you&#39;re the plainest of all plain people.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> But the mere fact that you are my Master gives you a leg up over all the other boring people out there.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> That&#39;s why you don&#39;t have to be so afraid of me, and should interact with me more. I may even listen to some of your requests, too.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Of course, this all assumes that you show the utmost reverence and respect for my beauty!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Now, is there something you&#39;d like to ask of me? Why don&#39;t you grovel at my feet and beg a favor like the powerless human you are?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> Ultimately, I believe she wanted to let you know that she wants you to rely on her more.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> Teehee. I guess that&#39;s the only way she could convey such a sentiment.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yeah, got it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I feel like we&#39;re closer now.</p><hr><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> Yes. Hearing that from you...</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> While I&#39;m not even close to being as capable as she is, and though saying this may be overstepping my boundaries, I&#39;m relieved.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> She can be difficult and may be misunderstood quite often...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Oh? I thought I heard a familiar voice...</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> Getting...along...beautiful... My job...here...done...</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> Farewell... May the pharaoh...be blessed...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Oh! Great Medjed! Please wait! Even I acknowledge your form as the embodiment of beauty!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Actually, I love you, so I want a photo! Can I take a picture with you!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Teehee... Until now, perhaps I was keeping my distance from Cleopatra.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> After all, she&#39;s a queen, the world&#39;s most beautiful woman, and a pharaoh.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But after this ordeal, I feel like I understand her a little more.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> She may have odd ways of saying things, but she still lets those she approves of know it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> In some ways, she&#39;s quite fair.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> She believes her standards are absolute, and never compromises. She&#39;s a pure, strong-willed person.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That may be what makes her the ultimate beauty.</p><h2 id="where-the-heart-is" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#where-the-heart-is" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Where the Heart Is</h2><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> ...The ideal body! That is what I seek!!!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Indeed, has there ever been anyone in history who has not endeavored to sculpt their body into a monument to absolute physical perfection?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Of course not! And that&#39;s why we&#39;re here! Is that clear, Master!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> C-crystal?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> No! I can tell your heart isn&#39;t in this! I don&#39;t need hollow reassurances!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> The ideal body...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> That&#39;s right. The ideal body. Do you know what I mean?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> ...No, I can see you don&#39;t.</p><hr><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> (Sigh)...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> So I have to explain this whole thing again, do I? Well, I won&#39;t! Besides, as my secretary, you should already know what I mean!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> You only get to be a pharaoh&#39;s secretary because you truly understand them!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Now, begin the preparations!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Preparations?</p><hr><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> To help me get in shape, obviously!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> You have my permission to activate the simulator!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> After all, there is no better way to get in shape than exercising, and there is no exercise more effective or beautiful than my Pharaoh Fighting Style!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> I already practice for an hour every morning to maintain my looks and my health, of course, but that&#39;s not the same as using it in live combat.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Which is why now is the time for live combat!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> ...Or at least, it would be, if something would attack us. (Sigh) Where&#39;s a pack of marauders when you need them?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Anyway, since I can&#39;t count on actual enemies to invade in accordance with my workout schedule, I decided to compromise and use the simulator with some help from other Heroic Spirits here.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> I trust you understand all that now?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> More or less!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Good! That was a beautiful answer! Now, let us be on our merry way!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What if someone&#39;s already using the simulator?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Oh, right. I hadn&#39;t thought of that... Well, if that turns out to be the case, that will just mean fate has chosen to aid me by providing me with an opponent!</p><hr><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> ...Yes?</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> I was just using the simulator to check up on my battle summons...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> Is there a reason you came all this way? I don&#39;t want to be rude...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> ...but couldn&#39;t you just set the simulator the way you want for your own training? Cleopatra, what are you\u2013</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> No. No, Pharaoh Nitocris. No more words.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> What I need right now is not talk, but exercise. Hard, strenuous, fat-burning exercise! I can&#39;t possibly get that from mere NPCs.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Now go on, don&#39;t hold back. Hit me with your best shot! On my honor as pharaoh, I can take whatever you throw at me!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> (Sigh)... All right, if you insist...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> ...Are you sure about this, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s okay. Please spar with her.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;m her secretary right now, so whatever she says, goes.</p><hr><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> V-very well then. I&#39;ll admit, fighting another Servant should help with my own training too!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> All right, here goes!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> ...Come forth, my armies of the dead! Come forth from my mirror, and show my enemies the power of a pharaoh!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Phew! Not bad!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> But, it still seems like something&#39;s missing... You weren&#39;t holding back, were you, Pharaoh Nitocris?</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> No, I was taking it fairly seriously. But I see that wasn&#39;t enough for you.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Hmm, I&#39;m afraid not! Between this place and the minions you summoned, this just wasn&#39;t what I needed!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> This is not what I had in mind for my ideal exercise routine. Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I know. You want to try a different place?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You want to try the next area in the simulator?</p><hr><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Right!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> Well now. I certainly didn&#39;t expect to see you here.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> What&#39;s that? You&#39;re looking for combat training partners? I see.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> In that case, perhaps my homunculi and golems would do the trick? I was just trying my hand at some automata as well.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Very well. It will be interesting to see how much of a sweat these creatures can help me work up.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> All right, come at me! I&#39;ll take you all on and look beautiful doing it!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> ...Well, they were certainly worthy opponents, but I&#39;m afraid they just aren&#39;t beautiful enough for my tastes.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Hmm... Finding the ideal exercise routine is a lot more difficult than I expected...</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> Cleopatra, last of the pharaohs, I apologize that my creations failed to meet your expectations.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> No, it&#39;s all right. I am the one who should apologize.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Forgive me for simply moving on without properly rewarding you for your efforts.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> I&#39;ll make it up to you by throwing you the finest banquet you will ever see. Oh, I&#39;ll have to invite Pharaoh Nitocris too.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Now then... Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yup, I know.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Time for the next area?</p><hr><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Come, let us be on our way!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> That was most satisfying. Just what I would expect from an area modeled after my own Egypt.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> But, I&#39;m afraid it all feels a bit too familiar.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> They were certainly strong enough opponents, but it just wasn&#39;t quite exciting enough to really make my skin glow!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> ...This really is difficult, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> I guess the ideal workout, and the ideal body aren&#39;t things that can be obtained overnight...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> But I&#39;m not going to give up! Not after I&#39;ve already come so far! Right, Master!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;re definitely not one to give up, that&#39;s for sure.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> On to the next area then?</p><hr><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Yes! This time, I&#39;m going to find what I&#39;m looking for!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> This is...the ocean.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> ...Why am I doing all this?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Why am I putting myself through so much strenuous exercise? Why couldn&#39;t I be satisfied with Pharaoh Nitocris&#39;s workout, or the desert&#39;s?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> I&#39;m sure those questions have crossed your mind at least once or twice, my secretary.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Why am I working so hard to improve a body that is already perfect?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> I don&#39;t blame you for wondering. You must find it more intriguing than any of the Seven Wonders of the World. I doubt even that famous detective could understand.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> The truth is\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;re looking for the ideal body, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...Is this about Caesar?</p><hr><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Hehe, you really don&#39;t understand. I don&#39;t blame you.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> But my search for the ideal body is not for me. I seek it for another.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Namely\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Caesar?</p><hr><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Uh, y-yes, that&#39;s right. ...Wait...</p><hr><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Ho-how did you know!? Are you some kind of genius!?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> I knew you were a hard worker, Master, but I didn&#39;t think you were actually one of the greatest sages of all time... You might even be wiser than Diogenes.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> A-ahem. I suppose it is obvious by now, but yes, you&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> This is all for my darling Caesar.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> The ideal workout routine is not to help me achieve an ideal body, but to help Lord Caesar slim down!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> What sort of arduous battle will best ensure he gets into shape?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> That&#39;s why I&#39;ve been going to such great lengths...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> ...And now (sigh) I&#39;ve ended up at the ocean. A virtual ocean that can&#39;t possibly lead back to Alexandria.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You really want him to lose weight that badly?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Don&#39;t you love him just the way he is?</p><hr><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> ...This isn&#39;t just about looks.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Though that&#39;s not to say looks aren&#39;t part of it! They&#39;re super important, you know! But I never chose my dear Caesar for his looks alone!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> ...It&#39;s my son, Caesarion.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> My child who faced down Rome all on his own, and died just a few days after me.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> The true last pharaoh ever to walk the earth.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> I...I want my dear Caesar to accept him as his rightful son and heir...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> ...and to do so in the same beautiful body he possessed on that fateful day.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> I know it&#39;s too late to change history. I know the past will stay the past, no matter what he says now.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> But, even so...I still want him to say it. Both for my beloved son&#39;s sake, and for my own pride.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> It&#39;s the only way my son and I will ever be able to rest in peace...</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Are you sure that&#39;s what you want?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Wouldn&#39;t being at peace mean that you would no longer have the need to materialize in the present world?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Lord Caesar!?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> You&#39;ve finally found a Master you trust enough to accompany you wherever you choose to go.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Do you really want to throw that beautiful bond away just because of something I said?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> I...!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Oh, Caesar! Please don&#39;t say things like that. I just had this idea when I was washing my face this morning!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Please don&#39;t make me second-guess my amazingly beautiful decision to see it through now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Uh, yeah, we can&#39;t have that...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> No, we can&#39;t! I&#39;m reminded yet again of just how very good Caesar is with words!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I get ideas when washing my face all the time too.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Exactly! They just...come to you, as though they were a revelation from the heavens or something!</p><hr><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> (Hmm, you really are second-guessing yourself now. Ahh, what a good woman you are.)</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> (Being around you makes me want to be a better person, and that is no mean feat. But right now, love of my life, I must bite the bullet and tell you what you need to hear.)</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Cleopatra, Master there is the only person you have ever known that you are willing to accept as your secretary.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Unlike us, you two had no existing bond to speak of. It was destiny that brought you two together.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> I promise, I&#39;m not going anywhere. So I urge you to cast your mind back and remember once again.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Surely you don&#39;t need to hurry to your death so quickly, do you? Yes, when you were alive, your beautiful light was snuffed out all too soon...</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> ...but does that mean you must do the same now? No, it absolutely does not!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Lord Caesar...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> I didn&#39;t know you cared so deeply for me...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Or for Master...!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> That is why, my beloved Cleopatra...</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> ...I will never lose weight!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> !!!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> !!!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> That is all. Master, I will allow you to continue to shine bright by my Cleopatra&#39;s side.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> I understand the bond you share is special, and not at all akin to cheating. So I will allow it!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> In turn, my dear Cleopatra...I trust you will allow me a little freedom of my own.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> My eye may wander juuust a bit from time to time, but that&#39;s not cheating either. Really. I&#39;m talking just a teeensy little bit of ogling.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Hell no!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Curses!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> That request would be enough to ruin a romance that lasted a hundred years, but fortunately, my determination stretches back over two thousand years!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> It may have taken approximately two thousand and one hundred years, but at last, your time has come! Prepare to die, Lord Caesar! And to finally lose some weight as well!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong></p><p>Never!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> That&#39;s the one thing you refuse to back down on, is it! Well, there are some things I won&#39;t compromise on, either!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Master! My secretary! I&#39;m fairly tired after all that exercising, so it&#39;s time for the FP Fighting Style!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Don&#39;t look at me like you have no clue what FP stands for! It stands for \u201CFinal Pharaoh,\u201D of course!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Fortunately, my makeup is already perfect for a beachside backdrop! Are you ready to shine bright with me, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Ready!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;ll shine as bright as I possibly can!</p><hr><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Very well then... Let us begin!!!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> I-impossible...!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> I can&#39;t believe you saw through my golden sword!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Hmm, maybe you do have a point. As impressive as my swordsmanship is, my body does limit how I can employ it.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Well done, Cleopatra. And, Master? If I may make one last request?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Please...take care of Cleopatra in my absence!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Ahh... Wait for me, Caesarion! I&#39;m coming to join you, my son!</p><p><strong>Caesarion&#39;s Voice:</strong> (Uh, that&#39;s okay. I&#39;m fine on my own. Really.)</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Wha\u2013</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong></p><p>N-no! No, no, no, no! Caesar is...g-gone...? This can&#39;t be happening...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Ahh...! Ahh, ahhh...! I... I...!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> What have I done!?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong></p><p>Caesaaaaaaaaar!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> So, um, it turns out I&#39;ve been here all along, but never mind that. I don&#39;t think you have any reason to worry. He didn&#39;t disappear; he just changed into his spirit form.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> Besides, this is the simulator. Nobody disappears in here unless there&#39;s a really, really serious accident.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> What!? B-but, but he was shimmering and everything!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> I thought the only time Heroic Spirits shimmer like that is when their Spirit Core has been destroyed and they&#39;re about to completely disappear...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> Well, um, I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s because he also has the kind of sparkling charm that you do?</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> Maybe just spending so much time with you was enough for it to rub off on him...? Or something like that.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> !</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> I don&#39;t believe it... Then, this means...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> He ran off on you again.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Sorry, Cleopatra! It sucks, I know.</p><hr><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong></p><p>Grrrrrrrrr, I can&#39;t believe it! He was shimmering so much I just assumed he was truly disappearing!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> ...Well, there&#39;s no point crying about it now. Besides, pharaohs don&#39;t get discouraged. Devastatingly depressed at times, maybe, but not discouraged. Besides, that was a long time ago.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Anyway, Caesar was right about at least one thing.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Master... My very first secretary.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Now that I&#39;ve promoted you to such an esteemed position, I would be a failure as a pharaoh if I didn&#39;t ensure you enjoyed each and every day you spent serving me.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Wouldn&#39;t you agree? Yes, of course you would. No need to answer that!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> I want you to feel overwhelming joy and pride in being my secretary, and in having summoned me...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> ...So it&#39;s all right if you hold off on completely fulfilling my wish until you do.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Does that mean you&#39;re okay with Caesar not losing weight then?</p><hr><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Absolutely not!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> That is an entirely separate issue!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Now then, let us go for a walk on this beach until the sun has set! In fact, we should call Mash and have her join us as well. Oh, and Pharaoh Nitocris!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> Yes?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> I would like to demonstrate the glory of the Double Pharaoh sparkle to my secretary. I trust you don&#39;t mind!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> Ah... Must I?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> I. Trust. You. Don&#39;t. Mind?</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> (Sigh) Fine, fine. If you insist.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Wonderful! I knew you would understand, queen of the heavens!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Very well then...first, I&#39;ll need to change into a swimsuit. The finest swimsuit ever made that is sure to suit me per\u2013</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> Oh, in that case, I have an idea. Why don&#39;t you try this Medjed outfit made with a new kind of\u2013</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> No, thank you! I don&#39;t have the courage to wear something imitating Lord Medjed!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> At this moment...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong></p><p>(Shock)</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> ...I&#39;m looking for something on the cutting edge of fashion, such as an outfit from Paris Fashion Week!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> I always shine bright in all my endeavors, and that&#39;s not about to change anytime soon!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Now, let us all be on our way!</p>',613),n=[a];function p(i,h){return o(),e("div",null,n)}var l=t(s,[["render",p],["__file","Cleopatra.html.vue"]]);export{l as default};
