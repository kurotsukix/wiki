Speaking of which, I haven&#39;t introduced myself. I am Lord El-Melloi II.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> I am a mere human, who became the Spirit Origin of a famous strategist from the Three Kingdom Period in China.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Lord?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> What, don&#39;t you know? What kind of manuals did Animusphere make...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> The Second?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Right. I was originally a third-rate noble from the countryside. For certain reasons, I took after my mentor and inherited his name.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Excuse me, Lord El-Melloi II. When you say Lord, do you mean the &quot;Lord&quot; of the Mage&#39;s Association?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Yes. I represent one of the twelve noble families that operate the Clock Tower, the center of the Mage&#39;s Association. The lowest-ranked, though.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Did you know Director Olga Marie? What time period are you from, anyway?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Same as Fujimaru, I&#39;m from the 21st century. Before I knew it, I became a Pseudo-Servant.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A Pseudo-Servant...like me. Are you someone that was empowered by Heroic Spirits?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> ...The result was the same but the idea&#39;s different. There&#39;s nobody identical to you in this time.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Originally, it&#39;s impossible to form a Demi-Servant. Just the same as it&#39;s impossible for Dhampir to be born among vampires.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> As I&#39;d expect of a Clock Tower mage, you probably understand the logic behind the impossible.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> That&#39;s right. Mash is an extremely unique example of success. It&#39;d be hard to recreate an accident.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> I&#39;m glad to hear that. I would&#39;ve suggested an immediate dismantling of Chaldea if it was such a screwed-up organization.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, Fooou!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> ...Sorry, that was insensitive of me. You aren&#39;t guilty of anything, ma&#39;am. I would like to correct myself.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> W-Well, you cannot deny that creating Demi-Servants was an inhumane experiment.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Your feeling of disgust is justified, Lord El-Melloi. Even more so if it comes from justice and morals.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That aside, please continue your explanation. What are Pseudo-Servants?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Ah, yes. I shall answer that question.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> A Pseudo-Servant is someone possessed by a Heroic Spirit. Those Heroic Spirits who can&#39;t become a Servant...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Perhaps they are higher beings like Divine Spirits, or their Spirit Origins can&#39;t be created by Chaldea.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> In order to summon them as Servants, human vessels are sometimes used.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> That is what a Pseudo-Servant is. Using a human body as catalyst to forcefully summon a Heroic Spirit.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ??</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ?????</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Oh-uh, Fujimaru looks confused. Obviously since it&#39;s a particularly unique case, right?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> In short, it&#39;s someone being possessed by a ghost.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Then the psyche of the possessed is overwritten by the Heroic Spirit...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> I&#39;m the opposite. I took only the role of Zhuge Liang, because western logic doesn&#39;t match eastern logic.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> But with the greater good of protecting humanity in mind, we share a common goal.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> That&#39;s why after a discussion with the Strategist on who should control the body, I ended up staying because of my knowledge of modern eras.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I see. That&#39;s very much Zhuge Liang. Just like what he did at the end of his life.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The important thing was for someone to execute his strategies, without participating on it...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> In other words, he found the one capable of his strategies, so he decided not to appear.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> That&#39;s right. We&#39;ve only talked for a bit, but it&#39;s obvious he&#39;s more of a monster than history described. I didn&#39;t feel like I was talking to a human.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Can you fight?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...You&#39;re just a human?</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, Fooou.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> I would&#39;ve been incinerated if I was just a human.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> By becoming one with the Heroic Spirits, I temporarily became a Servant.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Follow me. I will show you proof.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Around here is fine. Enemy approaching. Prepare for battle.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> You will immediately see if I can fight as a Servant.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> In turn, I will assess your potential as a Master. Kill two birds with one stone, right?</p><p><strong>Monster:</strong> Gaooooooooooooo\u2014!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> They&#39;re already pumped up! What did you do, Lord El-Melloi?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Well, this will be interesting. I used some pheromones to excite them.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Be careful when you fight, ma&#39;am. The enemy is on a rampage. Don&#39;t let your guard down.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master! I think he&#39;s gone too far with his logic!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The enemy response is still spreading! It&#39;s massive. Just how excited are they!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This is no time to be in awe, Doctor! Do something!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Sorry, there&#39;s nothing I can do beside scanning the area... You just have handle it by yourselves.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Got it! It means I can only rely on Senpai, right!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Sorry Doc. Let&#39;s do this, Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Same as usual. Let&#39;s do this, Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> I see. Aren&#39;t you a courageous one? No plans, but you sure got guts.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Humph\u2014Not bad at all.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> You remind me of myself in the past. If that&#39;s the case, &quot;I&quot; shall show my true strength.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Of course, this is merely on the path of me reaching him. But it seems this will be a fruitful contract.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The battle is over... You know...I&#39;m three times more...tired than usual...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Good job, Mash.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...It was a disaster, huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Foou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m relieved that you and Fou...both made it...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Those wild beasts had their eyes on the two of you, I was doing everything I can...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> You&#39;re done? So how did I do, Fujimaru? Did I pass?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;ve convinced me.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> That&#39;s good. I&#39;m finished assessing you too.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That&#39;s not fair, you can fight as a human.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Not fair? Oh I see, you mean comparing to you? So you&#39;re jealous that I can fight on the front line despite being a human.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Cherish what you&#39;re feeling now. Because it requires strength to withstand that feeling of powerlessness.</p><hr><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> As you can see, I can fight as a Servant. You might be unsatisfied with my firepower, but I will make up with my intellect.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Oh. He&#39;s definitely a first-rate Servant. I mean all Pseudo-Servants are exceptional cases to begin with.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Fujimaru, eventually you&#39;ll be able to meet a Pseudo-Servant who fused with a god, I think.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Probably...Well, I am a special case.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Most vessels chosen to become Pseudo-Servants... in other words, mages, already possess powers.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> And when Heroic Spirits possess humans, they will choose those who closely resemble themselves. So of course they are powerful.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Those integrated will then transmigrate into a third personality, a new personality if you will.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Those kinds of Servants are troublesome. After all, they tend to think like Divine Spirits.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> They will probably be completely selfish and ask for all kinds of impossible things.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Then you&#39;ll know that I&#39;m one of the better ones.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Hahaha...Well, let&#39;s save that for the future. Good job, Mash, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Come home with Mr. El-Melloi II.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I couldn&#39;t fight with you, but I can welcome you home with a warm cup of tea.</p><h2 id="endless-sea" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#endless-sea" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Endless Sea</h2><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (Senpai, Mr. El-Melloi seems off. I know he looks irritable all the time, but now...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Is he looking at the sea?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> He&#39;s looking at the sunset?</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fou.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> ...So.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Ma&#39;am. If you&#39;re going to hide, at least put down your shield. Anyone will notice a black steel wall on the beach.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> You too Fujimaru. As her Master you should&#39;ve pointed that out.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> S-Sorry. It seemed like you wanted to be left alone...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Nnnng...kyau, kyaaaau!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Nothing, I was just looking at the sea. I heard it was named Okeanos due to the Grail.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> But it&#39;s just a name. It&#39;s a horizon as far as you can see, but the edges simply adhere to each other.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Just like a scroll. A sea enclosed in all directions that perpetually revolves around the same area.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> You can sail it endlessly, but in truth, it&#39;s just a clipped miniature garden. How absurd.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> This is not the place I set out to reach. Not even close to the real Okeanos.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You wanted to reach Okeanos? Are those the words of Zhuge Liang?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> ...Hmph, those are my words. Watch your mouth. It appears I got too sentimental.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> It was a dream. One that I had when I was younger. All the experience I&#39;ve gained was to further that goal.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> I didn&#39;t become what I am now naturally. I was an average mage.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Taking on that troublesome teaching position, inheriting the name of El-Melloi, refining my third-rate magical circuit, it&#39;s all because\u2014</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> I wanted to become the ideal I yearned for when I was young. Now, I&#39;m just a crooked old mage.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A crooked mage...you? Even though you are a first-class mage?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Only my position is first-class. My ability as a mage isn&#39;t much different from Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> I somehow managed to keep up with those first-class monsters with my knowledge and preparations.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Dr. Roman can see through that too. Whatever you say about that guy, he&#39;s a natural at talent assessment.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...You didn&#39;t reach your ideal?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Stop with your nonsense. I did reach it. That&#39;s why I&#39;m like this, right?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> I reached my ideal, just not the natural way. It&#39;s a bit harder every day, and it&#39;s killing my stomach.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> You need to remember, Fujimaru. With strong convictions and desires, you can reach your ideal.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> It&#39;s a rough path for an ordinary person. You&#39;ll reach your ideal but lose your way of life in the process.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...You couldn&#39;t reach Okeanos?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Well, I haven&#39;t started the journey yet. I&#39;m just not ready to reach the endless sea.</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, Foou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What&#39;s in the forest, Fou? Master, Lord, enemy sighted!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Geez. No time for fond memories huh?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> \u2014It&#39;s about to begin, Master. Let&#39;s see how much you&#39;ve grown.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Didn&#39;t even break a sweat. You don&#39;t consider them enemies anymore, huh?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> ...Hmm, growth as a mage is unlikely, but it looks like you&#39;re gaining experience as a Master.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> It&#39;s good to be diligent. All right, I will give you this as a reward for your efforts.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Is this...a jewel? It appears to be an expensive Mystic Code...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> It&#39;s not. It&#39;s just a common protective ore. On top of that, it&#39;s a used one from me.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> I pocketed it as a precaution when I was young, but I don&#39;t need it anymore.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> No one will acknowledge your effort anyway, right? That&#39;s why I&#39;m giving it to you as a reward.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, Foou!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Hey, calm down there! My student showed progress, it&#39;s natural!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Look what you did! Now my expensive suit is ruined! Not to mention that my hair is sticky from the sea breeze.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> I shouldn&#39;t have come to the beach. Who&#39;s dumb enough to want to come here?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Mr. El-Melloi just left...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> He must see his younger self when he looks at you, Senpai.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> In that case, I&#39;m honored...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...I&#39;m not that eccentric...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, here you go Senpai. A gift from your teacher.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> He said that it was used, but I&#39;m positive that he prepared it just for you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Let&#39;s fight and not give up! Let&#39;s meet our teacher&#39;s expectations!</p><h2 id="truth-of-the-ascension" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#truth-of-the-ascension" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Truth of the Ascension</h2><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Foou, Foou\u266A</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You look happy, Fou. You really liked that lunch.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It certainly was delicious.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Everyone had different dishes.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Today&#39;s cook was a Servant apparently. Which Heroic Spirit was it I wonder... Let&#39;s check the kitchen.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Whoaaaaaaaa!? Whaaa, What happened here?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Hmm? Seems like something happened. Whose voice was that? It doesn&#39;t sound familiar.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Is it an intruder? A mysterious object is approaching... Contact in 3, 2, 1\u2014</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Ouch!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Ow...hey, why don&#39;t you look where you&#39;re going! Don&#39;t stand in the middle of the road, idiot!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;re not allowed to run in the halls.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Forgive me, it&#39;s an emergency! Anybody would run at mach speed in my position!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It&#39;s ok. You&#39;re so small it tickled.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Well aren&#39;t you condescending? Jerk!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Excuse me. Who are you and why are you running like this? You don&#39;t look like a Chaldea staff.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Oh...Well, you know I&#39;m a... Hey, isn&#39;t this Mash and Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Good timing! Help me, you guys! We have to do something before anybody else sees me like this.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ??</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ???</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...Who are you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> You can&#39;t tell!? It&#39;s me, Wav...I mean, El-Melloi II!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II(Young):</strong> I know it&#39;s strange, but I suddenly turned into my younger self!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> !!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> No way!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You look totally different!</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Exactly! I mean, your frame is completely different!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II(Young):</strong> I&#39;m telling the truth! You and the Master should be able to tell, right?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II(Young):</strong> Mash is a Servant! She should know! I am El-Melloi II!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Y-Yes... It comes as a surprise but he&#39;s telling the truth. I mean, he&#39;s the same height as me.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II(Young):</strong> Don&#39;t call me short! Oh, this is not the time to get hung up on words.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> How did this happen?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Do you know the cause?</p><hr><p><strong>El-Melloi II(Young):</strong> Of course, I have an idea. It must be those ill-mannered goddesses, I&#39;m sure!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II(Young):</strong> Right, that&#39;s got to be it. I knew something was up when she brought me a present...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II(Young):</strong> A show of gratitude my ass! I don&#39;t remember meeting her at a cafe at all...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II(Young):</strong> Anyway, we need to Rayshift now, Fujimaru! Let&#39;s hurry and raid their base!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...And so, we&#39;re back to this familiar scenery. Is this...the &quot;Shaped Isle?&quot;</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II(Young):</strong> Actually, it&#39;s supposed to be the &quot;Shapeless Isle&quot; you know. Hey, wicked goddess! Come out!</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> Oh. Why, it&#39;s Fujimaru and Mash, along with...Well, well, well.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> You&#39;re so small I didn&#39;t realize you were there. I see the Professor is with you too.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> I welcome your unexpected visit here. What gift did you bring me this time?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...Her basic condition is receiving a gift. This goddess never ceases to amaze me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Sorry, I&#39;ve come empty-handed.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> That&#39;s too bad...but don&#39;t worry. Even though you brought me no gifts, I see you did bring me a fine toy\u2014Ahem, ahem.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> Such a fine and intelligent gentleman with you.

Leaving her alive won&#39;t benefit this world, its people, and all men!</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> Oh my, how barbaric!</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> In every era, men have their selfish reasons to go after frail women, but...</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> Women these days are strong.

Why don&#39;t you just give up and lift my curse.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> ...Now I&#39;m pissed. &quot;I&quot; wanted to do this so I was just going to stand by and watch.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> But you&#39;re mistaken if you think we&#39;ll allow some nameless brats like you to talk down to us like that.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> I&#39;ll show you the technique that has made brave men cry. Is that ok, &quot;me?&quot;</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> Yeah. I guess we&#39;re left with no choice (grin). Let&#39;s do this...</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> Cooooome, Meduuuuusaaaaaa!</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> My big sisters... Please stop summoning me like that. I&#39;m not some giant robot, you know...</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> Silence! Don&#39;t talk back to your sisters! Anyway, that thing over there! That one!</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> That cheeky guy over there! He dared to raise his hand against us!</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> That&#39;s right.

Technically she&#39;s not lying.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> ...Hmm. Is that true, sir?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II(Young):</strong> Whoa. Isn&#39;t that Servant a bit too scary? No, you&#39;re getting it wrong!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II(Young):</strong> We came to talk! We only resorted to force because we weren&#39;t making progress!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Unfortunately, he&#39;s not lying either.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> \u2014All right, get ready. As punishment, I&#39;m turning you to stone for one hundred years.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> You&#39;ll be small for a statue... At least I can use you as a paperweight.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II(Young):</strong> Hahaha, I see that Riders sure are professional at pressing all my buttons!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II(Young):</strong> Now Fujimaru, I mean my Master! Punish that giant for me!</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Enemy Rider defeated. ...But, is this really a good reason to fight?</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> Damn...</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> Hey, that was sloppy Medusa.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> You didn&#39;t go easy on him because he looks like a good kid, did you?</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> That&#39;s not it, &quot;me.&quot;</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> Medusa isn&#39;t getting heavier and slower, Fujimaru is getting stronger.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> (...Not heavy...I&#39;m not heavy, big sister...(tears))</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II(Young):</strong> Your secret weapon Medusa is no match for us by herself. This time, why don&#39;t you just\u2014</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> What&#39;re you talking about? The real battle begins now. Both Golems and Medusa couldn&#39;t finish the job...</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> In that case, we&#39;ll have to get serious. I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll be forgiven for revealing that forbidden name.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> Huh? No way, big sister. You wouldn&#39;t!</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> I seeeee. You&#39;re right! If it&#39;s come to this we have no choice but to use that!</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> Hmmmm. Get ready, you Monchhichi! Demon God of the Shapeless Isle, distinguished in Greek mythology\u2014</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> The Demon God who flattened 100 brave men, the True Body of the Trinity Goddesses Gorgon. We release you here and now!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> \u2014Actually, there&#39;s no such thing as the True Body of Gorgon. Even if there was it wouldn&#39;t be introduced here.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> (...Twice...Twice was I defeated for unknown reasons... Just how unfortunate can I be...)</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II(Young):</strong> Haha... You scared me for a moment. Turns out it was just you three attacking together.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II(Young):</strong> You&#39;re really out of ammunition now, right? Just give up already and release me from this curse!</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> A curse... What is that? Surely, my sisters didn&#39;t cause you any trouble...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II(Young):</strong> Don&#39;t worry about it, I know you&#39;re always the victim. Sorry about the rough treatment. Why don&#39;t you rest?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II(Young):</strong> You two, Stheno and Euryale! Get rid of this rejuvenation curse on me!</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> Rejuvenation? What&#39;s that? That little runt there is\u2014</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> Hehe. So &quot;I&quot; didn&#39;t realize after all. That&#39;s Lord El-Melloi II himself.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> For some reason, he&#39;s returned to his younger self.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> No way! That handsome man used to look like that? How much pain do you have to endure to grow into that?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II(Young):</strong> That&#39;s my business. Leave me alone! Wait, hold on. You didn&#39;t know?</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> Nope, I didn&#39;t know. If I did, I would&#39;ve teased you much more.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II(Young):</strong> That means... No way...</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> Yes, as you might expect, My Lord\u2661 We have nothing to do with it.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II(Young):</strong> What\u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What\u2014</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What did you say?!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Well, that&#39;s what I thought!</p><hr><p><strong>El-Melloi II(Young):</strong> So, so, so, so what&#39;s the cause, then? I can&#39;t think of any other external factors!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Well, then the answer is clear, isn&#39;t it? If there are no external factors, it just means your growth led to that body.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It is a logical conclusion. Your body got younger because of your Ascension.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II(Young):</strong> That&#39;s... That&#39;s ridiculous... Then it&#39;s pointless, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II(Young):</strong> Ascension is a reform to make one stronger! Why would I revert to a form when I was immature?</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> For you, there are things you can only do in that form...</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> Rather, you can say that form is the &quot;origin of all your concepts.&quot;</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> See, your ability as a Servant hasn&#39;t degraded one bit, right?</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> When you fight as a &quot;main character,&quot; that form is the most powerful... Or most fitting.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> You didn&#39;t even realize it... How adorable can you get?</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> I ended up playing with you for a bit. I received the best present to relieve my boredom\u2661</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II(Young):</strong> Ugh...Ughhh...Ughhhhhhhhh... Again...Again, played by you!</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> But, it doesn&#39;t feel right to just keep taking from you...</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> If you play some more, I may be able to give you information about an elixir to turn you back, Lord El-Melloi.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh... Let&#39;s go, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Lord El-Melloi is going into a battle that he&#39;ll never win.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...Those who challenge Stheno will only end up being played by her and then disposed of...I shall be careful.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Let&#39;s go back to Chaldea.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Good luck, Lord El-Melloi.</p><hr><p><strong>El-Melloi II(Young):</strong> Oh. Let&#39;s go home then, damn it! Just you watch. I&#39;ll be back to my original form in no time!</p>',349),a=[r];function i(g,l){return t(),e("div",null,a)}var p=o(n,[["render",i],["__file","Lord El Melloi II - Zhuge Liang.html.vue"]]);export{p as default};
