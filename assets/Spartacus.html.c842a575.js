Ye who&#39;s not an oppressor, but destined to become an oppressor one day.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> Yes. I see that you&#39;re confused. I understand, we&#39;re inside the camp of a Roman army.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> And at this moment, we&#39;re going to show them our strengths. So it seems that I cannot avoid my destiny for battle.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What&#39;s going on?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Where is this place?</p><hr><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> Not to worry. We both share the same destiny.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> Although if you do end up being an oppressor, I&#39;ll have no choice but to cut down your head\u2013</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> Perhaps, I should&#39;ve cut you down the day you became my &quot;Master.&quot; But for now... I shall accompany you.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> Or, maybe... No, as long as you&#39;re a &quot;Master&quot; there&#39;s no use. It&#39;s sad, but that&#39;s destiny.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What happened?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Please listen to me.</p><hr><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> It is time now for battle and bloodshed. The road forward from here will be a living hell. Yes, my blood will seethe.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> And my muscles, organs, skin, and all that I am will tremble with delight!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um... Master, Master. I don&#39;t want to bother you when you look so confused.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> \u2013And I know this is sudden. But it looks like we&#39;re captured.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Why?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> How come?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> All I know is that we were already like this when I woke up. See? Even Fou has cute little shackles on.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It seems that we will be forced to fight as combatants\u2013as Gladiators.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> You there, puppets of the oppressor. Come out. I&#39;ll take you on as much as you like.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> And what&#39;s making this even worse, Spartacus is really in the mood for a fight...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Rather than think our way out of this, it might be better for us to fight.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> All right, so we&#39;ll start with a warm-up, eh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master, orders, please. All right, let&#39;s begin!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> It is over, sad and fragile. And no one would sing of their praises.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> They stood before us, without a shred of fear in their body, they charged at us.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> Now that&#39;s courage. A great and might conviction, something an oppressor will never have.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> Hail them! Hail these warriors! Not me, but them!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Master. Wait a little while longer before giving orders.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> Ah-ha! You&#39;re next? Come at me!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A-A lion? Master, your orders! This could be a real fight\u2013!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> \u2013Or maybe not.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Now that I think about it, Spartacus was always renown for being a great gladiator.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> On this kind of battlefield, he can handle this all alone without a problem.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> \u2013This stench! It reeks! This is the stench of impatience. Mixed with the stench of rage.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> It&#39;s the stench of animosity, that they will not let us return alive. In that case, I am already prepared!</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> Monsters! Bring out the monsters that you people sealed away with your oppression!</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> That is their way to becoming free! For as long as our interests conflict, I will crush them!</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> Yet, when all has ended, I shall weep! I will take their hands, and shed tears of blood for their destiny.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...This time, it is my turn...right?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou...</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> Hmm. A warrior with the head of a beast, eh? I am ready. Let each of us now fight for our freedom!</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> Wahahahahahahahahahahaha\u2013!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We&#39;ve defeated the werebeasts\u2013but. From what I can see, it looks like more are on the way!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Now it&#39;s\u2013!</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> Now it&#39;s the merging of a woman and a serpent. But, whoever appears before me shall be a warrior.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> Will that torso of yours curl around me and crush me first? Or will my blade pierce your torso first.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> The bone crushing battle shall wait no longer! I&#39;ll gladly vanquish my foe!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Whew... When Spartacus got Lamia in that suplex, I wasn&#39;t sure how it would turn out.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> All right, what&#39;s next?</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> Oh, another lion? ...No, it&#39;s not. This is...a lion, yet a lot more ferocious!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Could it be\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A Chimera?</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> What an abomination! Well, never in my lifetime have I encountered a creature like this!</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> The trembling that I feel is by no means my imagination. Let&#39;s do this, great lion!</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> I shall risk my life\u2013to obtain my freedom! Gaaaaaaarrrrrrrrgh\u2013!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> I am...victorious...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m exhausted...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Well done!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You fought well!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Thank you.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> All right, what&#39;s next?...Hmm? What is the meaning of this?</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> The Roman soldiers have disappeared. The campsite is gone, too.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> Hm. ...What&#39;s this? Now I&#39;m troubled. What am I going to do now that the oppressor is gone.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> I was to regain my freedom after I defeat the oppressor. Now that he&#39;s gone, how am I going to...</p><p>Wait! Could this be what true freedom\u2013tastes like? Master, what do you think?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Well, let me see...</p><hr><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> Wait, there&#39;re more oppressors out there in the world. My fight won&#39;t end until I&#39;ve defeated them all.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> Yes, without a doubt\u2013 Until that day arrives, you&#39;re coming with me to the depths of hell.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> Oh, my Master!</p>',91),n=[e];function h(p,i){return r(),s("div",null,n)}var u=t(a,[["render",h],["__file","Spartacus.html.vue"]]);export{u as default};
