I trust you can hear me, you, whose fate is yet unknown.</p><p><strong>A Magician:</strong> Or are you that starry-eyed one I met on that day? Well, it doesn&#39;t matter.</p><p><strong>A Magician:</strong> I&#39;m stricken with boredom. Would you mind listening to me for a bit?</p><p><strong>A Magician:</strong> These aren&#39;t my own words, though. It&#39;s a song I heard, carried on the wind.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> “From now, I will tell you of a future. The future of the mystical island which became the land of fairies. ”</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> “The innocent shall return. To the Queen&#39;s castle, bottomless as it is. ”</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> “Accumulating, accumulating; like rain, like ashes. Fading away, fading away; like snow, like the unbelievable. ”</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> “Our hopes are at the ledge; still held within the palm of the queen&#39;s hand. ”</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> “Yet we must only endure a short time more. The morning when two thousand years have passed, the child of salvation will appear. ”</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> “They who unites fairies and humans, us and them. The child of salvation who will save the world. ”</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> “Like a moth to the flame. Even if it begins as but an ember, even if it cannot be seen. ”</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> “A city of iron, a sea of soot. When the calamity has been repelled, the pilgrimage will be hailed. ”</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> “Guided by the Staff of Selection, watched over by a foreign traveller, the child of salvation will reach the throne. ”</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> “The true king takes their place on the throne. A bloodstained crown presented. ”</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> “Ring out, ring out; like thunderous fury, like fiery lamentation. Let the six bells toll in demonstration. Make way for the true king. ”</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> “Before the red calamity reaches us. Before the black calamity bites. ”</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> “Although our work may be neglectful, we are descended of free fairies. ”</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> “Ever absent is our hope. A shining tomorrow is desired. ”</p><p><strong>A Magician:</strong> What do you think? Isn&#39;t it just like one of those songs where it doesn&#39;t quite get the point across, yet you can still understand it somehow?</p><p><strong>A Magician:</strong> I mean, that&#39;s just how prophecies are. The meaning may be ambiguous when you&#39;re first hearing it.</p><p><strong>A Magician:</strong> “You&#39;ll know it when it happens,” you know. Like a curse secretly stuck on your back.</p><p><strong>A Magician:</strong> Uh-oh, I&#39;ve been spotted by a scary lady. This is all I can do for you right now.</p><p><strong>A Magician:</strong> Will the next time we meet be after everything is over?</p><p><strong>A Magician:</strong> It&#39;s a pity I can&#39;t join in the battle, but it&#39;s a relief knowing I don&#39;t have to worry.</p><p><strong>A Magician:</strong> Well then, until we meet again. I&#39;ll be waiting in the land of imprisonment, looking forward to that time.</p><p>Note! Scene Change</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Was that...a dream?</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong> ......</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Ahem–testing, testing. Good morning, Sion speaking.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> The time is just before 7 AM. I&#39;m really sorry to be spoiling the solemn atmosphere,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> but this is a notification for all staff of Novum Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Movement has been detected in the sixth Lostbelt. The predicted emergency has now occurred.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Please do not panic, and gather in the control room quickly.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Oh, no! Let&#39;s go, Fou!</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Fou...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> He turned around and scurried off...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Mash Kyrielight, reporting for duty!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This is—what is going on, Master?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Hmph. There&#39;s no point in asking Fujimaru, Kyrielight.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Myself and Holmes just arrived and we don&#39;t even know anything! There&#39;s no sign of the technical advisor or Captain either!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> And then there&#39;s that smug alchemist over there...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I&#39;m glad you all slept well last night.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> The Director, Fujimaru, and Miss Kyrielight appear well rested.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Let&#39;s first go through the prerequisites, shall we, Miss Sion?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> That&#39;s right. Everyone, I&#39;m glad you&#39;re all in good health.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Fujimaru, the field researcher; Mash, demi-servant.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Meunière, the helmsman; Tomlin, first operator.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Kawata, second operato; Octavia, da Vinci&#39;s assistant.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Chin, vehicle maintenance; Cayenne, weapons design and maintenance; Elron, records clerk; Marcus, Spiritron Engineering maintenance.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> And Goredolf, taster of honey-filled pancakes in the dining room this morning.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Everyone seem to have remained calm and collected despite the situation. As expected of Chaldea&#39;s staff, who have weathered many battles!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> In that case, I can inform you of the current situation without hesitation. Oh, it&#39;s nothing to worry about at all!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> See, I have a rather bad feeling about this whole state of affairs, but I&#39;ll ask anyway! What&#39;s going on, Sion!?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> What does this ever-so-alarming red beacon signify?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> I don&#39;t know, perhaps there&#39;s a fire in the kitchen?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> No no, it&#39;s just that the Earth&#39;s in a bit of a pinch. At this rate, in 24 hours, we&#39;ll all be dead.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Oh, total extinction. That&#39;s a bit bigger of a problem than I expe—</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Wait, what are you saying, you kneesock-wearing Egyptian!?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Hmph, I take issue with you boiling me down to appearance, clothes, and nationality...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I agree, but for now, I think we should discuss the topic at hand.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> New Director Gordolf, Fujimaru, and the rest of the staff are all a bit shaken.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You mentioned the Earth is in trouble, but what exactly is happening?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Excuse me, you&#39;re right. We don&#39;t have a lot of time, so I&#39;ll get straight to the point.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> It&#39;s been three weeks since the shock of the operation to destroy Alter Ego Limbo.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Novum Chaldea has recently completed maintenance on the Storm Border, and has been devising a strategy to attack the remaining sixth and seventh Lostbelts.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> As I&#39;ve explained before, the sixth Lostbelt—Great Britain—doesn&#39;t need to be attacked.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Our priority was the seventh Lostbelt, where the “Alien God” is believed to be hiding.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Uh, umm, I&#39;m aware of that. We can leave the sixth Lostbelt alone. That&#39;s because—</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Come on, Fujimaru, let&#39;s hear it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Britain doesn&#39;t have a Fantasy Tree anymore.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Yes, the Fantasy Tree which had established the British Lostbelt was used to burn down the Fantasy Tree in Olympus.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> In fact, no magical energy reactions specific to the Fantasy Trees have been observed from Britain.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> The British Lostbelt will slowly vanish, just like the Chinese Lostbelt did.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Britain&#39;s in a bit of a dire state.</p><p><strong>Meunière:</strong> Hey, are you still half asleep, Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Meunière:</strong> Since Britain&#39;s in such a bad state, we were going to leave it until we finished our other business.</p><p><strong>Meunière:</strong> Beryl Gut said as much, right?</p><p><strong>Meunière:</strong> In order to burn the Fantasy Tree of Olympus, he burned the Fantasy Tree of Britain.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. Although the Lostbelt remains surrounded by a wall of light,</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> it&#39;s no longer a threat to pan-human history. That&#39;s been the consensus...right?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Yes. It&#39;s been a subject of our investigations, but we did not consider it a threat.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Until today, this very moment.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> This is a map of the planet&#39;s surface taken with observation by the Paper Moon, and predictive outcomes from the observational lens SHEBA.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> The British Lostbelt will vanish in 24 hours. With it, a wave of destruction will spread across the Earth like a tsunami.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> The planet will reach the end of its lifespan, and become unable to withstand its own gravitational pull. It will collapse into nothingness.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> This isn&#39;t like the pseudo-black hole used by the Alien God. This is a proper death of a planet.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> It&#39;s a “dead end for humanity”, one that will supersede the “bad end for humanity” that wiped Earth clean.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> H-how the hell did that happen!?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> The cause is unknown. However, now that we know the outcome, we can&#39;t afford to stand idle.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Both da Vinci and Captain Nemo are already beginning preparations to launch the Storm Border.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Up to now we&#39;ve been using the Shadow Border to transfer into the Lostbelts by means of Imaginary Numbers space.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> We aren&#39;t prepared for that this time. But, we do have the Storm Border.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> The Storm Border is able to break through the barrier surrounding the Lostbelt.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> As a large ship, it will be our frontline base, so to speak.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Even though the Shadow Border will be doing the on-site investigation, having a base that can supply us at any time is reassuring.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Also, TRISMEGISTUS II has defined this phenomenon as a “collapse. ”</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Or perhaps you could call it a “pitfall. ”</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Pitfall...you mean Britain is going to sink or submerge?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> We won&#39;t know for sure until we arrive there.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I dare say that this is a development that even the “Alien God” did not forsee.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> The disappearance of the British Lostbelt is, by all means, a good thing. It&#39;s the natural consequence of the Fantasy Tree losing its power.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> And yet, why should this “disappearance” continue to spread over the entire planet? If we don&#39;t solve this mystery, there&#39;s no future for us.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> There is nothing we can do to fix the blank state of the Earth if the foundation itself disappears.</p><p><strong>Meunière:</strong> You said there&#39;s nothing we can do about it. We only have 24 hours left! There&#39;s nothing that can be accomplished in that time!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Don&#39;t worry about that. The disappearance of Britain takes place in 24 hours in our time.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> But, according to SHEBA, the flow of time seems to be different inside those walls.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Once you enter the Lostbelt, you don&#39;t need to take that countdown into consideration.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> After that, you just have to resolve this phenomenon inside Britain&#39;s Lostbelt!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Nevertheless, it&#39;s true we don&#39;t have much time.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> From hereon out, all of Chaldea&#39;s staff will embark on the Storm Border.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> After the final safety checks, we will set sail for the British Isles.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> As soon as you arrive at the Wall of Light, break through with the Storm Border&#39;s dimensional boring equipment.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Infiltrate the sixth Lostbelt, Britain.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> That concludes the explanation. The Shadow Border has just entered the dock.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> It&#39;s a sudden operation, but you can get any further details from da Vinci once on the Storm.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Everyone, please be careful. I expect another fun story when you come back this time too.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> —Eh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What about you, Sion?</p><hr><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Haha, sorry, sorry. I did say “all staff,” didn&#39;t I?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> That was a slip of the tongue. Cut, cut, that&#39;s a wrap!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> I thought it would be impudent to call a newcomer like me part of Chaldea&#39;s staff.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Don&#39;t worry about me. I&#39;ll be continuing to observe the seventh Lostbelt from here.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> I&#39;ll do what I do best. You do what you do best, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> However, if you fail, this entire base will be up in smoke in 24 hours!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> So please, try your hardest, and do the best you possibly can this time!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Not that I&#39;m worried, of course!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Thanks! You too, Sion, stay strong!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Yes, I got it!</p><hr><p>Note! Scene Change</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> All crew members are hereby notified. Repeat. All hands on deck.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> Two hours after we set sail from the Wandering Sea, the ship has arrived in the waters surrounding the British Lostbelt, as scheduled.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> We are now 200 kilometers north of the British Isles. The Wall of Light that you can see now is a dimensional faultline.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> It is similar to the “End of the World” recorded in the sixth singularity.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> Analysis by both da Vinci and Nemo Professor has revealed that the dimensional boundary to the south of Britain is relatively thin.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> Therefore, this ship will take a large detour around the Wall of Light. Once we arrive at the southern part of Great Britain, dimensional drilling will commence.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> The mission is scheduled to begin in 45 minutes. All crew members are to remain at their stations.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> —Well then. As you heard, the operation will start without pause.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> The Storm Border is a large ship.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> It can&#39;t dive into Imaginary Number Space as easily as the Shadow Border could.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> Instead, it can overcome the dimensional friction that separates worlds from each other, using its immense propulsion and strong magical barriers.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> It&#39;s a giant drill. We&#39;ll use the Storm Border itself as a bullet to pierce through the Wall of Light.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> Once we enter, the turbulence will be similar to use of the Zero Sail. Everyone should remain calm.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> If you fall into a state of confusion, agitation, or panic, your soul will become unable to accompany your body.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> R-right, I got it. It&#39;s that thing that makes your head and chest feel awful.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> We&#39;re used to the Zero Sail by now. There&#39;s no point worrying, Captain.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> More importantly...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Uh, do we have a plan?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> I don&#39;t even want to think about entering the Lostbelt without any countermeasures or milestones!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Of course. I know exactly what we have to do, so you can relax.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> After all, I was brimming with energy to assault the British Lostbelt from the very beginning!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Is that so?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We were told the British Lostbelt was no longer a threat...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Indeed, but we still advanced with our plans to explore it.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> We have only fragmentary information, but we know about Beryl Gut, one of the two remaining Crypters, who is in charge of the British Lostbelt, and...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> About the Lostbelt King who attacked Olympus&#39; Fantasy Tree.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> What&#39;s more, this Lostbelt King also burned down the Fantasy Tree necessary for the survival of their own Lostbelt.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> It&#39;s unknown if they were deceived by Beryl Gut, or if this was by mutual consent.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> The important thing is they possess “substantial power, enough to burn down a Fantasy Tree. ” Which means—</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Rhongomyniad...right?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yes. Strong magic akin to divine judgement, able to reach a place as far removed as Olympus.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> A mystery that exceeds Kirschtaria&#39;s ideal magic. That was without a doubt Rhongomyniad.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Something not made by the hands of men, but magecraft woven in the inner sea of the planet.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The trump card against the Alien God that we desperately need.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The Inner Sea of the Planet? What is that...?</p><p><strong>Meunière:</strong> It&#39;s a legend of paradise...</p><p><strong>Meunière:</strong> Every legend talks about a “sanctuary that promises immortality. ”</p><p><strong>Meunière:</strong> Utopia. The Garden of Eden. Tír na nÓg. In Britain, they call it Avalon.</p><p><strong>Meunière:</strong> A paradise not of this world that can&#39;t be reached by ordinary means.</p><p><strong>Meunière:</strong> It&#39;s said that it&#39;s inside the planet, the place where the planet&#39;s soul slumbers.</p><p><strong>Meunière:</strong> It&#39;s a story that mages of the Clock Tower know as trivia.</p><p><strong>Meunière:</strong> I called it a legend, but it&#39;s not a legend to those who can see it.</p><p><strong>Meunière:</strong> If one person was able to reach the Inner Sea of the Planet, then you might be able to as well. In fact, there is a group that researches that sort of thing in the Clock Tower.</p><p><strong>Meunière:</strong> Well...it&#39;s a place that exists completely outside human knowledge.</p><p><strong>Meunière:</strong> When someone is involved in a thing like that, it&#39;s like they wander into a different world.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Hahaha, what are you talking about, Meunière? Could you be referring to the underground workshop?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> That stuff is just an exaggeration. They&#39;re merely an archaeological excavation team.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Underneath the Clock Tower—underneath London, is the Navel of the World. Don&#39;t take it so lightly.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Even if I were a supreme mage, I&#39;d be too ashamed to run my mouth about it like that.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Ahem, can we return to the point at hand? Apart from the inner workings of the Mage Association and the Clock Tower,</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> if the King of the British Lostbelt is operating Rhongomyniad, I want to investigate and uncover this power.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> We advanced with our plans to investigate Britain&#39;s Lostbelt for that very purpose.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> The current situation is unexpected, but we had planned to invade it sooner or later.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So, Master&#39;s mission this time is more than just on-site investigation...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Of course, there&#39;s also the matter of investigating and resolving the “collapse” that TRISMEGISTUS II warned of...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> The most important thing is to secure Rhongomyniad. Our objective this time is to negotiate with the Lostbelt King.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Negotiating with the Lostbelt King...you mean cutting a deal!? With the guy who shot ICBMs at us!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yeah. Even I think this is reckless. I&#39;d really love to have Rhongomyniad, though...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> We have the Storm Border, the Heroic Spirit system, and the Black Barrel.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> When it comes to the immediate situation of the planet, and seeking the means to neutralize the Earth Presid—sorry, the Alien God,</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Sion refuses to give up, saying that “the Divine Construct is necessary. ”</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Miss Sion is an alchemist of Atlas. She must have some distinct basis for that.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> As she had calculated, we received the Nautilus, and now the Storm Border.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Let&#39;s follow her prediction this time as well.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> We&#39;ll get our hands on Rhongomyniad, or whatever has replaced it.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Aww, isn&#39;t this a little too optimistic for you, Holmes?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The burden on Fujimaru might be unprecedented, don&#39;t you think?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...(I have a lot of work to do...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...(Yeah, it&#39;s a bit different this time...)</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> —That&#39;s enough chit-chat. Everyone, return to your stations.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> We will reach the drilling point soon. Please prepare for the impact of space-time crossing.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Y-yes! I&#39;m very sorry, Captain!</p><p><strong>Meunière:</strong> Oh shoot, the wall is right in front of us! I&#39;m ashamed of my carelessness, Captain!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> R-right, I got it! I still don&#39;t really understand, but I get the objective!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Don&#39;t think of this as the same old Lostbelt, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Use your head if you negotiate! Cut your usual recklessness down to a third!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> My, my. Director Gordolf beat me to it.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> The essentials were said, but it would be good to get as many weapons as possible.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> We have the wisdom and time, no matter who our opponent is.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> So long as you take it one step at a time, you&#39;ll always arrive at the truth.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Fujimaru, taking my seat!</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> Good. Professor, begin the final checks. Storm Border, commence Zero Coating.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> Triton Engines 1, 2, and 3, parallel operations all green. Calculating the time differential of the drilling target, complete.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> I&#39;m entrusting the protection of the armor to Da Vinci in the computer room. We of the Nemo Series will be focusing our attention on maintaining our course.</p><p><strong>Meunière:</strong> We&#39;ve got acknowledgement from the computer room, Captain! Chances of success, 99. 99%!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> Dimensional boundary piercing warship Storm Border, launch! From hereon, we storm the sixth Lostbelt!</p><h2 id="section-1-the-beginning" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-the-beginning" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 1: The Beginning</h2><p><strong>&quot;Fairies who adorned freedom.

Ah, damn it, I&#39;m still feeling lightheaded...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Hmm...“We&#39;ve broken through the light barrier! ” I remember Captain&#39;s gallant words, but after that...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> I can&#39;t remember what happened...but more importantly, who turned off the lights!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Captain...?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> Thank you, I&#39;m here. But...I&#39;m sorry, it&#39;s difficult for me to talk right now...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Captain Nemo as well, then...apparently, I&#39;m not the only one in a bit of a state...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Holmes?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Rest assured, I&#39;m still in my seat. However...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> If you ask me how I&#39;m feeling, I would have to say: not great. My consciousness and body are as heavy as lead.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I wonder if this is what they call a “hangover”?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> Holmes, it&#39;s the same here. I say, it&#39;s like the symptoms of a severe cold.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> The Marines have all collapsed and the Nurses are now carrying them to the infirmary.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> Neither Nemo Engine nor Nemo Bakery can remain conscious.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, no...why is this happening?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I&#39;ll explain it!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> Da Vinci...? You&#39;re okay?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Why, of course! As you can see, da Vinci is always in good spirits!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I was lucky to remain in sync with the Border in the computer room.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> While you were all unconscious, I did a full analysis of the situation inside the ship and the atmospheric conditions outside.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> How much do you want me to explain? After all, Nemo and Holmes aren&#39;t exactly in tip-top shape right now.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> No, it&#39;s fine. As long as you and Miss Kyrielight are in good health, we have our answer.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> The same as the Chinese Lostbelt, right? As soon as we entered Britain, Nemo and myself fell into a slump.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> “Heroic Spirits” cannot function in this Lostbelt.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Or, to be more precise, “Heroic Spirits originating from human history”...in other words, “human history” itself doesn&#39;t exist here, correct?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You&#39;re sharp. Nothing less from you, Holmes.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I&#39;ve just checked, and all of the Saint Graphs we had moved to the Border are in a dormant state.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> There is no foundation for the existence of “Heroic Spirits from pan-human history” in this Lostbelt.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The Chinese Lostbelt was a place where “heroes” weren&#39;t necessary, but...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> This version of Britain is probably a “history where heroes never existed”. That&#39;s why the Heroic Spirits of pan-human history can&#39;t set foot on the British Isles.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> They&#39;re “nonexistent” to begin with. Like being rejected by the world itself.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Uh-huh. So, in short, there is no sufficient foundation for the Heroic Spirits to be active?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> For instance...say, Robin Hood. That Heroic Spirit should be able to exist in any Lostbelt.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> He&#39;s a faceless man that exists as long as there&#39;s something that corresponds to a “human who is skilled with a bow, regardless of identity or background. ”</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> But are you saying that even such easy conditions can&#39;t be met in this Lostbelt?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yes, that&#39;s right. Thank you for the good analogy, Gordolf!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> No no, I remain a solitary director who has enjoyed reading your reports.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> You might even say that with just my knowledge, I surpass Fujimaru as a Lostbelt Master.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> But I see, this is a history that doesn&#39;t even include the concept of “people being good at archery”...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> What&#39;s the meaning of this?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Even in a Lostbelt that continues to exist beyond the year 2017? Can such a human history exist?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> It&#39;s not possible...Even if it is a Lostbelt, as long as it&#39;s still human history, it will follow a certain pattern.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> As long as you build a civilization in the human format, there will always be technical breakthroughs to be made.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> The way we breed animals, and thrive from it...if our culture and living standards don&#39;t reach a certain level,</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> we cannot survive for more than 10,000 years. Naturally, the many responsibilities of an occupation will eventually be divided, and thus, optimized.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Even if the titles are different, swordsmen, archers, spearmen, craftsmen, soldiers, kings, and detectives are born.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> The lack of such means—</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> There are no &quot;humans&quot; here...?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Good insight, Fujimaru. That is indeed the simplest conclusion.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> However, there are other possibilities. I&#39;ll leave this discussion for later.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> But the technical advisor and Mash weren&#39;t even affected in the slightest!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s...because I&#39;m a demi-servant, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> My Saint Graph is that of the Heroic Spirit Galahad, but I&#39;m not actually him...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yes, exactly. And I&#39;m not Leonardo da Vinci himself, either. Technically speaking, I&#39;m a homunculus.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Well, I&#39;m even more of a genius than he is! We should consider ourselves lucky!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> Then, in other words, you and Mash are the only Servants who can operate in this Lostbelt.</p><p><strong>Meunière:</strong> Seriously!? You mean we can&#39;t even summon a new servant here!?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> Since the Lostbelt rejects the concept of “heroes of human history”, we can&#39;t expect to increase our forces here.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> If we want to increase our strength, we&#39;ll have to ask for help from the locals of this Lostbelt.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> Most importantly...Da Vinci. Can you tell me, what has been going on for the last half hour?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Oh. Immediately after the Storm Border went through the Wall of Light, the systems went down.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> All electronic equipment stopped functioning for unknown reasons, and the Storm Border crashed.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Nemo Engine underwent a last ditch effort to get a single Triton engine running again.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The Storm Border managed to break free from the island&#39;s airspace, and crash landed somewhere off the southwest coast.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> So that&#39;s where we&#39;re at. The generator&#39;s down, too, so we&#39;re running on backup power for now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s why it was dark...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It&#39;s a tough situation...</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yup. The situation isn&#39;t great, to say the least. But hey, we&#39;re used to it by now, right?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> We&#39;re just lucky there hasn&#39;t been any attack from the outside. At least we can relax a bit and take the time to discuss our plans.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Ah, no outside attack.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> So, the Lostbelt King is unaware of our intrusion?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I can&#39;t say for sure, but it&#39;s possible. We haven&#39;t even landed on the island itself yet.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The Storm Border was stuttering more and more as we approached the island.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But this time...it just “stopped”. Nothing has been damaged or destroyed.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It&#39;s speculation, but the engines should be back to functioning properly as soon as we head away from the island.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> Even though it&#39;s based on the Nautilus, it still can&#39;t get close to the “Island of Mystery”.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> Anyway, I&#39;m ashamed to admit it, but making sure that the Storm Border was safe was the first thing on my mind.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> If we can restart the engines after heading away from the island, we have an escape route out of this Lostbelt.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> The rest is something to worry about later—Da Vinci, will the Shadow Border work?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That&#39;s no good either. We can use it as a boat to get to the shore, but it&#39;ll stop functioning once it lands.</p><p><strong>Meunière:</strong> Seriously...we can&#39;t even use the Shadow Border...</p><p><strong>Meunière:</strong> Oh, and what about our communications? Is there any chance of wireless communication on the island?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It&#39;s hard to say until we try. But at this rate, we shouldn&#39;t get our hopes up.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> In the worst case scenario, we&#39;ll have to revert back to primitive means of communication. Holmes, have you ever used a carrier pigeon?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I&#39;ve only ever solved a few cases involving them. Of course, it could be useful.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yes. Then I&#39;ll be your teacher this time, Holmes. Leave the correspondence to me.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> And let&#39;s be clear about how much time we have left.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The Storm Border can stay in this state for approximately 30 days.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> 50 days if we cut back by reducing what we&#39;re powering on the ship. That would involve cutting off the backup power supply.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That&#39;s the time limit for this operation.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> As soon as we&#39;re done, we&#39;ll move the Storm Border away from the British Isles and restart the engines.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Once the Triton Engine&#39;s magical energy stabilizes, we&#39;ll break through the Wall of Light again and leave the British Lostbelt.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I&#39;ve prepared the briefing regarding our current plan. New Director Gordolf, if you would.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Umm, as long as the Storm Border keeps away from the island, there&#39;s only one policy.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Fujimaru makes landfall secretly on the Island of Britain with Mash Kyrielight as [♂ his /♀ her] escort.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> While investigating the area, they will look for the cause of the Collapse observed in Novum Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> At the same time, if possible, contact the Lostbelt King and obtain Rhongomyniad.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Contact with the Storm Border may be too difficult during the operation.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Each of you will make your own decisions on the ground and return alive, with results, within 40...no, make it 45 days.</p><p><strong>Meunière:</strong> Just Fujimaru and Mash? You can&#39;t do that!</p><p><strong>Meunière:</strong> At least let me or Chin go with them! I mean, I&#39;m scared too, but come on!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Idiot, how is Mash going to defend you both?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Mash Kyrielight is not the panacea! If there&#39;s only one servant present,</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> I&#39;m going to need that servant to support Fujimaru!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> New Director Gordolf...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Papa Gordolf...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> I&#39;m not your papa! I&#39;m only in my twenties, you know!</p><hr><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> All right, you two! If you are ready, recite the mission statement!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Roger! Mash Kyrielight, I will assist Master in surveying the area!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Mash and I will do our best!</p><hr><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Hmm. Well then, let&#39;s get to work. After all, there&#39;s a 45-day limit.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Great Britain is large. If it were up to me, I would head to Oxford first...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> What are you doing, Technical Advisor!?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> It looks like she&#39;s packing things into her own backpack...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hm? What, because I&#39;m going with them on this little field trip?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I told you, leave the back-and-forth to me, right?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I&#39;ll write you all letters and send them to the Storm Border via familiar, thank you very much~☆</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Wh—</p><hr><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> What the hell—!?</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Hmm, mm, mmm...! That...that makes sense...!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Ngh, rrrrgh...there&#39;s no way around it...I will allow the technical advisor to accompany them!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> Fine...I&#39;ll take you as far as the coast. Take care of them for me, da Vinci.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> And with that, we&#39;ve finally landed in Britain~~!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It&#39;s really, really foggy! And yet, it&#39;s sooo warm!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> Please, there is no need to get so excited.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> We&#39;ve conquered five Lostbelts so far. Mysterious lands are to be expected at this point.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hey, it&#39;s like my first adventure. It&#39;s only natural that I&#39;m getting fired up!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> So, Captain&#39;s heading back to the Storm Border. You think you&#39;re pushing yourself too hard?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> From hereon out, it&#39;s up to us, the field research team! We&#39;ve been waiting with bated breath for this moment!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> Good grief...well, if she&#39;s that energetic, I suppose there is no need to worry.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> Fujimaru, Mash. While on your mission, please take good care of da Vinci.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> Earlier, before I fell unconscious in the control room, I caught a short glimpse of the state of affairs in Britain.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> The location due east of this beach was shrouded in fog, but there was what looked like a city beyond it.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> It&#39;s about two hundred kilometers away. If everything goes smoothly, you will be able to reach it in a few days.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> That is where you should be headed. I&#39;m worried about this fog, but there&#39;s not much you can do to avoid it...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll be careful.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> We&#39;re always cautious.</p><hr><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> Indeed. Then good luck, Fujimaru, Mash, da Vinci.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> I&#39;m looking forward to hearing good news.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Equipment check complete, Master. Survival kit, and 90 days of portable rations, all in one piece.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yeah, yeah. As long as I have magical energy I won&#39;t go hungry, so you only need enough food for the two of you.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Huh? Now that I think of it, where&#39;s Fou?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> He&#39;s not following either of you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You see...this time, Fou wasn&#39;t with us on the Storm Border.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s like he ran away and hid.</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Really? Feels a bit lonely, doesn&#39;t it? Wasn&#39;t Fou with you on your journey to restore humanity?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I was hoping for a similar experience that my adult self once had...Fou, do you not like Britain?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Well, it can&#39;t be helped. I&#39;m sure there will be future opportunities for us to travel together.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Of course. At such a time, Holmes, New Director Gordolf,</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Sion, Meunière, and Fou, we&#39;ll all go on an adventure!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> All right. Let&#39;s go!</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yeah! To the city 200 kilometers east of here! Or something like that!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It&#39;s a long path, so let&#39;s go, Ch-al-de-a!</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Yes, it is good to keep motivated. After all, we have a long path ahead of us...or so I feel.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci &amp; Mash:</strong> —Whaaaaat?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> —Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I can&#39;t believe it...what on earth...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It&#39;s only the start of my first adventure, and I&#39;m already hallucinating...!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What a surprise...both Master and da Vinci can see him too...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> If it was just me...I could have passed it off as an optical illusion caused by how nervous I am, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Tristan, to say the least...</p><hr><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> My, what is with this hostile atmosphere? It saddens me...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Certainly, I may seem unremarkable, like a weather vane spinning in the wind...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> It&#39;s true, it was a very automated, informal summoning, but...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh! My apologies, the report! The Round Table shield has a trace of heat from a summon!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (Speaking of, that familiar light near Mash just now...)</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Wait, really? It&#39;s not an illusion? It&#39;s—it&#39;s really a Saint Graph materializing!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It&#39;s the real Sir Tristan! But how!? A Heroic Spirit from pan-human history shouldn&#39;t be able to exist here!</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Hmm...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Apparently I am not being criticized, but it appears my summoning was unexpected.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> It was not by my own wish that I responded to the summons. When I came to my senses...I found myself in front of you.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Of course, as a Heroic Spirit on the side of humanity, I am aware of Chaldea, however...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> I too am clueless as to the present situation. Please, could you explain it to me?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> —And that&#39;s why.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Heroic Spirits can&#39;t be summoned. One was anyway. Clear?</p><hr><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> I see. So this is the Lostbelt...the impossible Isle of Britain.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> As for why the knight Tristan was able to be summoned here, well...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> It is probably because this is the coast of Cornwall.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> You could call it a bond with the land.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Even if history itself differs, the island itself should be the same.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh—that&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Sir Tristan is said to have been born in Cornwall, which is the southwest point of Britain.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So, the summon was possible because...or, could the land itself have sought relief, do you think?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Or maybe, Fujimaru, anxious about stepping into an unknown land...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> [♂ He /♀ She] subconsciously wished for someone to be summoned, or something.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Either way, it&#39;s reassuring that we have Sir Tristan with us. At the same time, it gives me hope!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Even if there are no “heroes of humanity” in this Lostbelt, if some connection can be made, it should be possible to summon the Heroic Spirits of pan-human history.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Sir Gawain of Orkney, for example. Or for that matter, King Arthur of Camelot himself!</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Straight to King Arthur...? That&#39;s—</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> No, it would be a pleasure. As King, I am sure he would be able to help you.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Of course, I offer you my services, though I am of little help. Yet it is my duty as a Knight of the Round Table.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Master Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Although it was not a direct summon, I offer to you my Failnaught. Please use me to the fullest.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Tristan the Lamenting, I will be your servant.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Then, I&#39;ll lead the way.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> If there is something you aspire to attain in southwest Britain, I shall be your guide.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> From this area, you can cross those mountains, and soon you will be in the hills.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> We can be on the road in about two hours. Let&#39;s go, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yeah. Good to meet you, Tristan!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> The ever-reliable Sir Tristan!</p><hr><p>~One hour from the start of travel~</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Sir...Sir Tristan...I hate to say it, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Hey, maybe we&#39;re lo—</p><hr><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> I&#39;m not lost.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Certainly...those of you that are dependent on your eyes may feel that way.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> But, we are definitely making progress. We&#39;ve already walked four kilometers. Progress is being made.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> It&#39;s just a case of “no matter how far you go, you cannot escape the coast. ”</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> If Sir Bedivere were here, I am sure he would say something like:</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> “Don&#39;t worry about it, Tristan! I&#39;ll lead the way from here, so you get some rest. ”</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> And that is how we&#39;d find an alternative route...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> So you ARE lost! And Bedivere would be astonished, don&#39;t you think?</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Yes...it&#39;s as I thought...Sir Bedivere would be dismayed...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> It saddens me...if only you had put it so bluntly before, I would have played an encouraging song for you on my harp...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (Even Bedi would hate that) It&#39;s a bad time.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> But, it is strange...</p><hr><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> That is for sure...maybe it is all this fog...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> I have been placing bewitched string along our path to ensure we are not walking in circles...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Yet somehow, the strings...they have been broken...but, they were not cut...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> I was letting go of the strings with my own hands...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> It&#39;s as if...I&#39;ve forgotten what I was thinking...just a minute ago...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> —!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...! Master, there&#39;s a high density of magical energy ahead!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a hostile species because I haven&#39;t received anything from the Border, but this is—</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Guh!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> We&#39;re under attack! Prepare to intercept, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> This will be your first battle in the British Lostbelt, fight with the utmost caution!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> —It vanished?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It was defeated?</p><hr><p><strong>Infant of a Rut:</strong> Eek, it&#39;s too strong~~! What on earth, a British ghost?</p><p><strong>Infant of a Rut:</strong> I managed to fight them off, but there was no response or reaction, so it doesn&#39;t feel like I&#39;ve defeated them at all!</p><p><strong>Knight of Sorrows:</strong> I feel the same...What marvelous vitality.</p><p><strong>Knight of Sorrows:</strong> One cannot simply classify it as a ghost or similar...that strangeness...that deep secrecy...it&#39;s just...</p><p><strong>Knight of Sorrows:</strong> No...we should be appreciative of the toil we went through. Well done, Master.</p><p><strong>Knight of Sorrows:</strong> We can&#39;t summon any Heroic Spirits here in Britain...so I was worried.</p><p><strong>Knight of Sorrows:</strong> But a simple, temporary summoning...it seems both possible, and reliable...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yeah, I managed...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It was more tiring than usual, though!</p><hr><p><strong>Infant of a Rut:</strong> Yeah. I was watching from the sidelines, but you seemed to be using more magical energy than usual.</p><p><strong>Infant of a Rut:</strong> In your case, you&#39;re converting your own life force into magical energy, so you should avoid fighting as much as possible—</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight:</strong> Oh, no—</p><p><strong>Infant of a Rut:</strong> Mash? What&#39;s the matter?</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight:</strong> Black Barrel—no, the whole of Ortenaus—</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight:</strong> It—it&#39;s jammed—</p><p><strong>Infant of a Rut:</strong> Mash!? What&#39;s happening, Mash!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Mash...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Da Vinci-chan...?</p><hr><p><strong>Knight of Sorrows:</strong> What&#39;s with you two...? There&#39;s a presence nearby, but...</p><p><strong>Knight of Sorrows:</strong> No...it&#39;s moving away. We can&#39;t. We&#39;ll get separated in this fog.</p><p><strong>Knight of Sorrows:</strong> I&#39;ll call them back here. Your names, your names were...</p><p><strong>Knight of Sorrows:</strong> Your names are...</p><p><strong>Knight of Sorrows:</strong> No...to begin with, my name is—?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Wait for me, redhead...!</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Redhead...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Who are you...? No, more importantly...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I...I am...who am I?</p><hr><p><strong>B：???:</strong> Oh no, no, no. Even though I was in a hurry, I&#39;ve seemed to have arrived a little late.</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong> Huh? Because I&#39;ve been taking it a little too easy? Come on, cut me some slack here.</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong> After all, this is the first time we&#39;ve met. It&#39;s important to have good manners and make a good first impression.</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong> But, I wonder if [♂ he /♀ she] was also at fault here?</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong> After all, entering the Nameless Forest without a talisman is tantamount to suicide.</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong> [♂ He /♀ She]&#39;s a Master of Chaldea. [♂ He /♀ She]&#39;s awfully brave, don&#39;t you think, Blanca?</p><p><strong>Moth on ???&#39;s Arm:</strong> —</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong> Do I trust strangers? Yes, I do. I would trust this one with all my heart.</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong> Well, I was a little bit skeptical until I saw them in person, but...</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong> I understand [♂ him /♀ her]. [♂ He /♀ She]&#39;s genuine. Serious about saving the world, with such unrivaled passion.</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong> —Ahh, it was worth having faith and waiting for so long.</p><p><strong>Moth on ???&#39;s Arm:</strong> —</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong> You&#39;re right, Blanca. It&#39;s time for me to get serious, too.</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong> Oops, are those fairies lurking in the shadows? One, two, three, four of them...oh dear, that&#39;s quite a bad omen.</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong> Thank goodness, they seem to be good-natured fairies. I&#39;m sure they can help.</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong> Well then, I guess we&#39;ll save the emotional greetings for another time.</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong> Godspeed, child of Chaldea. Try to get acclimated to the air of Britain first.</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong> Oh, but one thing—</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong> Whatever you do, don&#39;t make the mistake of saying you&#39;re human, okay?</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Mash—</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Maaaaash—!</p><hr><p><strong>A：???:</strong> Thank goodness. You&#39;ve regained consciousness.</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong> You don&#39;t appear injured, so I don&#39;t think your life is in danger...</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong> Please, let me know if you have any pain anywhere.</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong> I&#39;m still a novice, but I can do some basic treatment.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;re—</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> —Mash?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh. Ah–yes, that&#39;s right. That was my name, wasn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No, I&#39;m glad. I almost forgot my own name, so...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I see. Mash, huh. It&#39;s an original, but short and sweet name.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But, if you know my name, then you and I must have been friends, after all!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Good morning, [♂ Lysander /♀ Hermia]. Do you know where we are?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Where are we...? [♂ Lysander /♀ Hermia]...?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Uh...you&#39;re [♂ Lysander /♀ Hermia], right? It says so on your name tag.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I heard that we collapsed in the “Nameless Forest”. Do you know anything about it?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Once you enter, you get lost in the fog, and can&#39;t find your way out.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You&#39;re lost, your memory gets more and more hazy, you start forgetting who you are. In the end, you lose your name, and your past...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s like a forest of no return. It&#39;s the worst Fairy Territory in Britain, but...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> How could we have ended up in such a place...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I wonder if something bad happened...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s like if everyone ordered ginger ale, but I was the only one to get salt water, or something like that...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> [♂ Lysander...Lysander? /♀ Hermia...Hermia? ]</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (No...I can&#39;t remember anything...! )</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> [♂ Lysander /♀ Hermia? ] What&#39;s the matter, is something on your mind?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ah! Did you hit your head in the woods, by any chance? Is there serious damage to your skull!?</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong> No, that&#39;s not it. Perhaps, [♂ he /♀ she] doesn&#39;t know who [♂ he /♀ she] is...</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong> I very much doubt [♂ he /♀ she] can remember a single thing about you, about [♂ him /♀ her]self, about this place...</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong> After all, I am the same...</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong> All I remember, is that I was [♂ his /♀ her] follower...</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong> “I will defend my Lord even if it costs me my life”...that is the only thought that still keeps me standing.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;re...no, I can&#39;t remember!</p><hr><p><strong>B：???:</strong> Take it easy, milord. As for me, I&#39;m Isolde&#39;s lover...no, that&#39;s not it...</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong> Right, Tristram...my name, it must be Tristram...</p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> See, I have a name tag made of leaves on my chest. It is written in Old English. (smug)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s true. I can&#39;t read it properly!</p><hr><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> Yes. So, you are [♂ Lysander /♀ Hermia]. I&#39;m Tristram. She&#39;s Mash.</p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> Aha. Naturally, we are three travelling companions in distress together!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Of course, that&#39;s it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Alright, high five!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...? (What&#39;s Old English? )</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> In other words, all of us have no idea who we are, or where we came from.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But having something we had to accomplish,</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> we entered the Nameless Forest knowing the danger...and that about sums it up.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (I thought this was the coast, but guess we&#39;re in the woods. )</p><hr><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> Yes...the only other thing I can tell you, is that I am an outstanding genius among my people...</p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> A poet and a superb archer with transcendent technique.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I see. (In other words, you don&#39;t know anything. )</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What about you, Mash?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> W-well, it seems like I&#39;m the same as you two. I get the sense I&#39;ve forgotten many things.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Anyway.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We were found by the fairies of this village after we collapsed in the Nameless Forest.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The next question is, why did they rescue us? Are they slavers now? Or something like that? I&#39;ve heard of them...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ugh...I don&#39;t want to think about it, but if this is one of those villages...!</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong> Hello. Unconscious people, have you woken up?</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong> Aa—ah. Um, I heard your voices...I&#39;m sorry if I startled you.</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong> Um...everybody wants me to come get all of you.</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong> Look, it&#39;s going to get dark soon so...before then, okay?</p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> (...[♂ Lysander /♀ Hermia]. Have you met her before? )</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (No, never. )</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (I think this is the first time...)</p><hr><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> (Is that so...I don&#39;t feel any hostility from her. A good person...no, no matter how you look at it...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (A fairy straight out of a fairytale, right? )</p><hr><p><strong>C：???:</strong> Ah, er, um...</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong> Can you not move...? If so, we can always talk later...</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong> But if I do that, everyone will call me useless again...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> By &#39;everyone&#39;, you mean the fairies of this village?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s alright. We&#39;re just going to talk a little bit first, so please go on ahead.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I will explain to the others that you called us.</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong> —!</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong> I-I was useful! Oh, thank you so much!</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong> We&#39;ll all gather in the square to wait for you!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> She left...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Anyway, should we get going...?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Hah...Let&#39;s go outside, shall we?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m a little anxious, but it seems like things will only get worse if we stay cooped up in here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Well, no matter what they ask, we don&#39;t remember a thing,</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> so we can&#39;t fall under any weird prejudices like what city we&#39;re from, or if we side with the Queen or not!</p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> ???</p><p>Note! Scene Change</p><p><strong>Fairy-like Animal:</strong> Is that them!? The ones who were left for dead in the forest!</p><p><strong>Fairy-like Animal:</strong> Eww, they look like people, but they have no wings! The Wind Clan sure has fallen far, heeheehee!</p><p><strong>Fairy with a Friendly Face:</strong> Please don&#39;t lump them together with us. They&#39;re different from the ground up.</p><p><strong>Fairy with a Friendly Face:</strong> They&#39;re obviously convicts who were sentenced to having their wings torn off. Did they escape from Darlington?</p><p><strong>Petite Fairy:</strong> They&#39;re pale. Their limbs are like dead branches. What should we do?</p><p><strong>Fairy-like Animal:</strong> Well then, let&#39;s tear them apart! If we use their limbs for firewood, it&#39;ll brighten up the night!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> —(Lost for words)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (This is too much like a fairy tale...! )</p><hr><p><strong>Fairy with a Friendly Face:</strong> Before that, let&#39;s hear their story. That&#39;s our “Rule”.</p><p><strong>Fairy with a Friendly Face:</strong> Which clan do you come from, and what are your names? Which city are you from?</p><p><strong>Fairy with a Friendly Face:</strong> For what reason did you decide to flee to Cornwall?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No, it&#39;s just...we only know our own names.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I don&#39;t know where I came from, why I&#39;m here, what my purpose was, nothing...</p><p><strong>Fairy with a Friendly Face:</strong> —Huh!? You don&#39;t even know what city you&#39;re from?</p><p><strong>Petite Fairy:</strong> Tch. You don&#39;t even have a purpose, do you?</p><p><strong>Fairy-like Animal:</strong> Hah. Terrible. Awful. What is with that nonsense?</p><p><strong>Fairy-like Animal:</strong> I was hoping we could have ransomed her off. They&#39;d have made a real fuss over someone like her.</p><p><strong>Fairy-like Animal:</strong> Everyone, these guys—</p><p><strong>Fairy with a Friendly Face:</strong> Yeah, this calls for—</p><p><strong>Petite Fairy:</strong> Ah, you mean—</p><p><strong>Fairy-like Animal:</strong> We&#39;ll have to take care of them ourselves! We found some new friends—!</p><p><strong>Fairies:</strong> Yippee—! Yahooo—!</p><p><strong>Fairies:</strong> A festival, a festival! We found ourselves more friends!</p><p><strong>Fairies:</strong> Having no place to live, no purpose, nothing but a name!</p><p><strong>Fairies:</strong> They chase you, they stone you! You find yourselves at the end of the road!</p><p><strong>Fairies:</strong> In the “Nameless Forest”, you&#39;ll disappear by morning! Even queens run for their lives in there!</p><p><strong>Fairies:</strong> Welcome to Cornwall, the village at the end, my fellow countrymen!</p><p><strong>Fairies:</strong> It&#39;s been a rough journey so far, hasn&#39;t it? Haven&#39;t you suffered enough already?</p><p><strong>Fairies:</strong> Here, in the burning dregs of society, you can live out your lives carefree!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> S—</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> S-sure?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m full, I&#39;ve eaten way too much...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The fairies of this village were so considerate to entertain us like this tonight!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Also, you&#39;re a very good conversationalist. It&#39;s surprising.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You were a bit confused at first, but eventually spoke to the Wind Clan and Earth Clan without distinction.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Despite the fact that in the Fairy Kingdom, it&#39;s common practice to support one or the other.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Clans of Wind and Earth?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Fairy Kingdom?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh? You forgot that too? Really?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Hmm...that&#39;s a nuisance. The only thing you forget in the Nameless Forest should be “yourself. ”</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;ve heard that you don&#39;t go as far as to forget your daily habits, but...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What about you, Tristram? Do you know anything about the Fairy Kingdom?</p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The same as [♂ Lysander /♀ Hermia], I see. Then let me teach you two.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I don&#39;t know anything major, but I&#39;ve been taught the basics—</p><p><strong>Halobaromia:</strong> Alright, everyone pipe down! The banquet is over!</p><p><strong>Halobaromia:</strong> I know how you feel, I know. But unfortunately, it&#39;s getting dark. Let&#39;s pick the welcome party back up tomorrow.</p><p><strong>Onfam:</strong> The fun times are short, huh? I guess that&#39;s it. Everyone, let&#39;s get back to our roofs.</p><p><strong>Doga:</strong> See you later, [♂ Lysander /♀ Hermia], Mash! You too, tight-lipped Tristram!</p><p><strong>Doga:</strong> That roof is all yours! Keep yourselves hidden until morning!</p><p><strong>Halobaromia:</strong> You there, show our guests to their dwelling.</p><p><strong>Onfam:</strong> Be quick, the more you dawdle, the more wounds you&#39;ll get again.</p><p><strong>Doga:</strong> That&#39;s right. Don&#39;t get distracted and wander off, okay? No one&#39;s going to find you at night!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Y-yes. I-I&#39;ll be fine. Thank you for trusting me with this.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Everyone, I&#39;m going to take you back to the roof from earlier. That will be your territory from now on.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...?</p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Th-then, good night.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> This place is separated from the village square, but you&#39;re still within the village&#39;s boundaries.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> The animals of the forest can&#39;t come in. You can rest easily.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (She just bowed her head and left...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (We forgot to ask that girl&#39;s name...)</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Alright. I think you may be tired from talking to so many fairies,</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> but before we sleep, let&#39;s return to our conversation from earlier.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You know that this Fairy Kingdom, Britain, is literally a land of fairies, correct?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Uh—sort of, yeah.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (I had no idea, but I&#39;ll keep my mouth shut. )</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Good. Next is the types of fairies.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Fairies are different creatures with their own characteristics, so we&#39;d end up spending days going through them all.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So for now, just remember the big clans.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> In the Fairy Kingdom, a “clan” is like an ethnic group.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> “Wind Clan,” “Earth Clan,” “Fang Clan,” “Wing Clan,” “Mirror Clan,” “King&#39;s Clan. ”</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s all of them.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The “Wind Clan” is a race that looks exactly like humans, like Halobaromir. A clan made of “people”, if you would.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> They&#39;re all peaceful and rational, and have excellent Fairy Patterns.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The “Earth Clan” is a hardy and tight-knit race, like Onfam.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Among the clans, they are the hardest-working. Their help is needed when constructing buildings and roads.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The “Fang Clan” are like Doga, and live as one with the earth. No matter how you look at them, they&#39;re like a pack of wolves.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> They&#39;re belligerent, but actually very strong.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It could be said that the fairies of this land have been able to survive up till now because the Fang Clan fought for them.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> There&#39;s also the “Wing Clan” and the “Mirror Clan,” but...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I don&#39;t know much about the Wing Clan, since they&#39;re not talked about much...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The Mirror Clan used to be the most numerous in the fairy lands, but a few years back their entire village vanished...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Then what about the &quot;King&#39;s Clan? &quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> —Mrgh. Do you really want to hear about them, [♂ Lyse /♀ Herm]?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The King&#39;s Clan are a bunch of good-for-nothings! The cause of all discord, division, and conflict in Britain!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> There&#39;s only one in charge, yet she acts like a big shot and looks down on all the others!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Talking about city life to a naive country girl just. Isn&#39;t. Done!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That fancy dress! So many suck-ups! Grand plans for the future! Just die already!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> — (Speechless)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (Sounds like a sore spot...)</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Sorry, I&#39;m a little biased. Please forget all of that just now.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The King&#39;s Clan&#39;s...head, is a bit of a special case. She has no peers.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> She&#39;ll welcome and protect the fairies who obey her as part of her Clan, but otherwise...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Well, if we ever get the chance to meet her, you will understand too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Anyone who sees her would say,</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> “W-what a horrible person. Just by looking at her, my future is ruined! ”</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You can tell at a glance by her appearance and behavior.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> By the way...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You&#39;ve been acting strange for a while, Tristram. You seem rather nervous.</p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> It&#39;s...yes, it is nerves. Actually, you could say I am frightened.</p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> Ever since we went to the village square, there has been no time to relax.</p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> To the two of you, they seem to be such frail creatures, but...</p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> Simply because they are fairies, they are terrifying. I may have lost my memories, but I recall that much.</p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> Even that fairy girl who led us here possesses some degree of Mystery...</p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> They may seem harmless, but their power far surpasses our own.</p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> If they so desired, the fairies of this village could easily kill us...</p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> So, please don&#39;t forget that...it is rather terrifying...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Apparently Tristram was in the military.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I can&#39;t wrap my head around the idea of fairies fighting each other.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Enforcing the queen&#39;s demands...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Aside from the fairies employed in the castle, I heard that fairies solve all their disputes through discussion.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Well, maybe there are some rule breakers among them that just lack common sense.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But there didn&#39;t seem to be any fairies who disliked us in the square earlier.</p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> I certainly didn&#39;t sense any hostility from them, but...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, there&#39;s no danger. They&#39;re all outstandingly ordinary fairies—oh?</p><p><strong>Voice from Outside:</strong> Be at ease, be at ease. The prayer is over, close your eyes.</p><p>The time for fun is over. Put down your books and dim your lights.</p><p>Goodbye today, the today which has come to an end. Once and forever, today has ended.</p><p>Forgive us, forgive us. Forgive us our sins, for we will forgive you your sins.</p><p>It&#39;s all in the past anyway. Just be sure to clean up!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Looks like it&#39;s time for lights out. Let&#39;s continue this discussion later, shall we?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We&#39;ve been so generously welcomed. Let&#39;s not do anything that would displease them.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;re right. I&#39;m so full.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Is that alright with you, Tristram?</p><hr><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> ...(nods silently)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Let&#39;s see, is this the light? Oh wow, it&#39;s a glass lamp!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Could it be that someone from the Earth Clan in Norwich washed up here? I&#39;ll try and talk to them tomorrow!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Well, good night, [♂ Lysander /♀ Hermia], Tristram.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I was concerned what would happen when you woke up, but thankfully you&#39;re both so honest and friendly!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Me too.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Good night, Ma</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ma? Why did you cut off the name?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...? You just couldn&#39;t bring yourself to say it, could you?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s—I see. I&#39;m sure it was a very important name to you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It happens, [♂ Lysander /♀ Hermia]. Well, good night.</p><hr><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>???:</strong> G-good morning, everyone. Today, I-I&#39;ve been assigned to show you around the village.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> That said, it doesn&#39;t cover much area. So this will not take long.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> It seems that Cornwall was built over an older village.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Two hundred years ago, after the Fairy Knights overthrew the fairy lord of Cornwall,</p><p><strong>???:</strong> the lord&#39;s curse brought about the mist that causes those who enter the forest to lose their memories.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> It shrouded the area, and the village was abandoned.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> After that, even Her Majesty couldn&#39;t touch it, and it became the most dangerous area in Britain.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Nobody comes after us here. It&#39;s like a penal colony.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What&#39;s a Fairy Knight?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Ahaha, are you serious? A Fairy Knight is a Fairy Knight, you know? Hehe, you&#39;re a funny one.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> By penal colony...is everyone here a criminal...?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> No, it&#39;s not quite like that, but...</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong> This is the Territory of fairies who have become “hated. ”</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Those whose role has ended. Those who are less valuable. Those with no friends. Those who lost their purpose.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> It&#39;s a small gathering of fairies who trickle here after finishing their destinies...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Everyone here has a kind heart. Fairies who would rather cooperate than compete with one another.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> But...that&#39;s no way to live in Her Majesty&#39;s Britain, so...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Because it&#39;s easier to die than to be laughed at, shunned, or robbed by your friends...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I think everyone came to this forest because they just wanted everything to end...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Doga:</strong> Oh hey, [♂ Lysander /♀ Hermia]! Last night was great!</p><p><strong>Doga:</strong> I like you, you seem like you enjoy good food! I&#39;ll get you some more today, alright?</p><p><strong>Halobaromia:</strong> Good day to you, [♂ Lysander /♀ Hermia]. There is life in your voice. It is like a spring breeze.</p><p><strong>Halobaromia:</strong> How about a verse today as well? I too will pick up the lyre for the first time in some time.</p><p><strong>Onfam:</strong> [♂ Lysander /♀ Hermia]. If your clothes get torn, come see me.</p><p><strong>Onfam:</strong> I&#39;ve still got some Norwich-made cloth left over. It&#39;ll look great if you wear it!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (※Facial expression saying, “What&#39;s with this difference in treatment? ”)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Y-you&#39;re popular, [♂ Lysander /♀ Hermia]. I&#39;m almost in the same boat as you, but...haha...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I guess it&#39;s that...dignity you exude? I wonder...I&#39;m indifferent to stuff like that...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Is that so? I think you&#39;re wonderful too, Mash.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> [♂ Lysander /♀ Hermia] has an air of freshness about [♂ him /♀ her], and brings a positive atmosphere just by being here.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Mash&#39;s aura feels warm and bright.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> It reminds me of peaceful times and makes me feel nostalgic.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Hehe. That&#39;s true. I&#39;ll be honest, my only thing I have going for me is my cheerfulness!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> My creed is to smile no matter the circumstances! Thank you very much!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Hehe. That&#39;s true, a smile is the best, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Well now, let&#39;s tour the village.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> If you know the boundaries of our Territory, you won&#39;t disappear by the end of the day.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> This is how far the village goes. Is there anything else you would like to ask?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I assume the mists of the Nameless Forest don&#39;t enter the village. Is the surrounding fog deep?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Also, if this used to be a village, are there any roads left that get to the middle of the country?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Let me see...the fog doesn&#39;t get that bad as long as you stay away from the depths of the forest.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> But, as you might expect, you&#39;ll still get lost...and the road to the heartlands is even now overgrown with plants...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I see...it seems some quick thinking is necessary to get out of the forest...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Huh? Mash, do you and the others want to leave the forest?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No? Not at all? For some reason I just considered it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Isn&#39;t that right, [♂ Lysander /♀ Hermia]? After all, we came into the Nameless Forest willingly.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It seems that way, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I still don&#39;t understand anything...</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong> I see...but I was almost convinced.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I had a feeling that you all were different from the fairies who usually come here.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Perhaps you wandered in here by some mistake.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Please, tell me if you require anything. All I can do is act as a guide, but...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> As long as nobody scolds me, I will stand by you all.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Well...at any rate, I have a grasp of the topography of this village.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Now that there are no more fairies accompanying us, let&#39;s get to it, [♂ Lysander /♀ Hermia].</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Get to what?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, don&#39;t play dumb! There&#39;s only one thing to do in this situation!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Test our skills! We&#39;ve forgotten everything but our names.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What our limits are, what our best strategies are...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Let&#39;s go out in the woods for a bit and try it out! Magecraft is power, so all we have to do is practice! Chop chop!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m sorry I was so useless...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No no no, it&#39;s my fault...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It wasn&#39;t necessary for you to learn combat skills...meaning, you never had to fight yourself...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> [♂ Lysander /♀ Hermia], could you be the [♂ son /♀ daughter] of a clan head...!? H-how could I have been so careless...!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m sorry, how rude of me...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;ll do better tomorrow, so please pretend this never happened...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m the one who should apologize...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Sorry I couldn&#39;t fight before...</p><hr><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> I hope you do not mind, [♂ Lysander /♀ Hermia]. On the contrary, I am quite convinced.</p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> I cannot think of the reason, but I am convinced you are capable.</p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> Last night, I was daunted by the sheer potential of the fairies. But that is not the case anymore.</p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> I would say that you are a good leader. Like a coach in football.</p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> If you are here, we will make it in the end. I am sure of that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Thank you, Isolde&#39;s lover...</p><hr><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> Heh—it&#39;s Tristram, [♂ Lysander /♀ Hermia].</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> —.</p><p><strong>Doga:</strong> Yeah, they hate us!</p><p><strong>Doga:</strong> Unable to pay the annual “existence tax”, I fell out of favor with the Queen!</p><p><strong>Doga:</strong> Someday, I might join you in the forest, and choose to forget everything!</p><p><strong>Halobaromia:</strong> But, I&#39;m not afraid.</p><p><strong>Halobaromia:</strong> Even if you&#39;re chased away from the cities, nothing changes in the end.</p><p><strong>Halobaromia:</strong> There&#39;s a Calamity on the horizon. The bell tolls for us all equally, no matter our status.</p><p><strong>Halobaromia:</strong> Only a few will survive. Those that do can choose where to live as they please.</p><p><strong>Onfam:</strong> We&#39;re fairies, part of the six clans, and we live for the festivals!</p><p><strong>Onfam:</strong> We&#39;re scared of the Queen, we&#39;re scared of the Mors, and most of all, we&#39;re scared of ourselves!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> The chorus has begun...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It&#39;s so...filling...</p><hr><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> It is pleasant, is it not? The tempo is simple, but it is oddly energizing.</p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> Is that all improvised? You seem very accustomed to it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Indeed. Joining together in a circle to celebrate is a reason to live for fairies.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This is the only time the Wind and Earth Clans stop squabbling.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That is, if they don&#39;t drink too much...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> There are fairies among them who get really drunk. I wonder if it&#39;s the atmosphere that does it?</p><p><strong>Onfam:</strong> What, you&#39;re not going to eat any more, [♂ Lysander /♀ Hermia]? You just got here, no need to hold back.</p><p><strong>Onfam:</strong> Or was it such a painful journey? Hm? Your right hand...</p><p><strong>Onfam:</strong> They look odd, but are those Command Spells? To have three drawn on you...damn.</p><p><strong>Onfam:</strong> Just forget it. There&#39;s nobody here who will force you to do anything.</p><p><strong>Onfam:</strong> You&#39;ve done your best up till now. You&#39;re a great [♂ fella /♀ gal] despite being so scrawny.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Huh...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (Huh...why am I...crying? )</p><hr><p><strong>Onfam:</strong> Hey, what are you crying for, moron?</p><p><strong>Onfam:</strong> Come on, first get some rest until you&#39;re satisfied. When you get bored you can help me with the village chores.</p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> You seem like a considerate fairy. But, Command Spells...Command Spells...</p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> I am so close to recalling something but...aah, how vexing...</p><p><strong>Halobaromia:</strong> Alright, everyone pipe down~! The party is ending here~!</p><p><strong>Halobaromia:</strong> I&#39;m not drunk, drunk I am definitely not. Therefore, I know exactly what time it is.</p><p><strong>Halobaromia:</strong> Let&#39;s get back to our homes before the beasts wake up.</p><p><strong>Halobaromia:</strong> We wouldn&#39;t know if you were eaten alive! Marm! Sania! Dunbarton!</p><p><strong>Halobaromia:</strong> The Wind Clan must get back before anyone else! As the most beautiful of the clans, we must maintain discipline!</p><p><strong>Doga:</strong> What!? You sure get cranky when you&#39;re drunk, Halobaromia!</p><p><strong>Doga:</strong> We&#39;ll be prepared at tomorrow&#39;s feast! See you, [♂ Lysander /♀ Hermia]!</p><p><strong>Doga:</strong> Tomorrow, I&#39;ll show you to our playground! It&#39;s fun to play ball!</p><p>Note! Scene Change</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Today&#39;s welcoming party has ended as well. At this rate though, it seems like it will pick up again tomorrow.</p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> Yes. It is quite enjoyable when you know you are being wholeheartedly welcomed.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So you say, while holding a bow? Do you never put that down?</p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> Yes...it seems to be a habit of mine.</p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> It seems I used to lay my fingers on these bowstrings even as I slept...</p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> Goodness...listening to the sounds and reading the winds at all hours...how much did I love practicing, I wonder...</p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> Well, I may fall out of the habit eventually. It seems there is no need for us to fight here.</p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> Come, [♂ Lysander /♀ Hermia], Mash. We shall return to our tent as well.</p><p><strong>Voices from the Square:</strong> Hey, you over there! There&#39;s a tomorrow as well, make sure you clean up!</p><p><strong>Voices from the Square:</strong> Y-yes, I understand. I should clean up after everyone, right...?</p><p><strong>Voices from the Square:</strong> What else is there to do, you idiot!? You can&#39;t accomplish anything unless you&#39;re constantly reminded!</p><p><strong>Voices from the Square:</strong> I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m sorry...! I&#39;ll try harder, I&#39;ll try harder...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> —</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Wait. That voice just now...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No, let&#39;s go back to the tent, [♂ Lysander /♀ Hermia]. We&#39;re all still outsiders.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I think we should wait and see a bit if we want to interfere in their affairs.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You don&#39;t like it when someone who doesn&#39;t know much about you voices a complaint about you, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Even if the fairies of this village are peaceful, the village is situated in a bad location.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> If some kind of trouble were to occur, we can&#39;t escape.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So be cautious here. Understood?</p><hr><p>Note: Investigate</p><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;m going back to the square.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Right, well if you understand—Hey, weren&#39;t you listening!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Hah, hah...to have to start running all of a sudden, geez...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But there&#39;s no use complaining. If it&#39;s come to this, I&#39;ll be a busybody too!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m really bad at this kind of thing, but it&#39;s too late to turn back now!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Wait...huh? There&#39;s nobody here in the square?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It sounded like someone was forced to stay behind and clean up the mess...but it&#39;s still all messy?</p><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Did we really just hear all that...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It appears so. I think something might be amiss, but as long as there&#39;s no trouble...</p><hr><p>Note: Listen to Castoria</p><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yeah...I guess you&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. Let&#39;s keep our ears open tomorrow.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> If there&#39;s something we have a problem with, I&#39;m sure we can come up with a solution if we discuss it.</p><hr><p>Note: Branches End</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Let&#39;s get back to the tent this time. It seems like this village is dangerous at night.</p><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;re right. Let&#39;s go.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> Good morning, [♂ Lysander /♀ Hermia]. I slept well last night...wait...</p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> Something doesn&#39;t feel right...what I said didn&#39;t feel sincere...</p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> [♂ Lysander /♀ Hermia]...[♂ Lysander /♀ Hermia]...don&#39;t you think that doesn&#39;t sound quite right?</p><p><strong>Voices from the Square:</strong> You still haven&#39;t cleaned up! You&#39;re slacking off again, you useless wretch!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Someone is yelling in the square. Shall we go and see what&#39;s going on, [♂ Lysander /♀ Hermia]?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Of course!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Let&#39;s go!</p><hr><p>Note! Scene Change</p><p><strong>Doga:</strong> Of all the cheek! I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be able to have a feast tonight.</p><p><strong>Doga:</strong> Hey. Why haven&#39;t you been doing anything? Do you hate [♂ Lysander /♀ Hermia]?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Oh no...no, not at all...it&#39;s just...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> You see...I forgot what I was supposed to be doing...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Before I knew it, it was already morning...everyone was scolding me...</p><p><strong>I：Fang Fairy:</strong> Hey Doga. It&#39;s her, you know, I think she&#39;s lost it.</p><p><strong>Doga:</strong> Hah...it was foolish of me to trust you.</p><p><strong>Doga:</strong> You can be on your way now. Get out of here. You&#39;re an eyesore, so stay away from the village.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Oh—thank you for your understanding! Please call on me again!</p><p><strong>Doga:</strong> Oh. Yo, [♂ Lysander /♀ Hermia]! Yesterday was a lot of fun!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Who was that fairy girl...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You left that girl alone to clean up all the mess?</p><hr><p><strong>Doga:</strong> Hmm? You mean that kid?</p><p><strong>Doga:</strong> Hey, what was that kid&#39;s name again?</p><p><strong>I：Fang Fairy A:</strong> No idea. Hey, what was their name? You said something about it when you came over, didn&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>J：Fang Fairy B:</strong> I think it started with something like “Ho” or “Hu”! Pretty sure it was a stupid name!</p><p><strong>Doga:</strong> Oh, that&#39;s right. She was here from the beginning, wasn&#39;t she?</p><p><strong>Doga:</strong> Well, regardless of the fog, you&#39;re done for if you can&#39;t even remember your own name.</p><p><strong>Doga:</strong> [♂ Lysander /♀ Hermia], if I were you, I&#39;d be minding my own business. You don&#39;t want to catch the “nameless” disease, do you?</p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> Nameless...you think she has no name? Is that why you treated her the way you did?</p><p><strong>Doga:</strong> Hm? What good is a nameless fairy? She has no place here anymore.</p><p><strong>I：Fang Fairy A:</strong> That&#39;s right. There&#39;s no place for them in this village. Come to think of it, her roof is outside the village, right?</p><p><strong>J：Fang Fairy B:</strong> Yeah. Can&#39;t afford to put it inside the Territory. Lucky she&#39;s still breathing, huh?</p><p><strong>J：Fang Fairy B:</strong> The scars multiply by the day, but she still has her limbs. I wonder if she was actually a great fairy lord in the past?</p><p><strong>J：Fang Fairy B:</strong> Not that it matters any more!</p><p><strong>J：Fang Fairy B:</strong> Even the beasts of the forest aren&#39;t interested in nameless meat!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> —</p><p><strong>Doga:</strong> That&#39;s enough boring chit-chat. Let&#39;s go, [♂ Lysander /♀ Hermia]!</p><p><strong>Doga:</strong> I told ya, we&#39;re playing football at noon. The playground awaits!</p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> What do we do now, [♂ Lysander /♀ Hermia]? They headed for the playground, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Mash. Do you know what a nameless fairy is?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Well, as the name suggests, it&#39;s a fairy who has lost their name.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We lost our memories in the Nameless Forest, but fairies can lose even their names.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Fairies are essentially immortal. They do not have the same lifespan as humans or animals.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But, when we&#39;re born, we have a purpose deep in our hearts...something we can be passionate about.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> When a fairy loses that, they lose their name, and then they gradually waste away until they die.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> She&#39;s one of those...it&#39;s been a long time since she lost her name...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Is it true that she has no house in the village?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It must be. Fairies who have lost their names are hated by other fairies.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The fairies here were generous enough to let us into their village...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I know what you&#39;re thinking, [♂ Lysander /♀ Hermia]. But we can&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> If we invite her to our tent, the other fairies will cause a ruckus.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What we can do is, well—</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We can find where she lives and get rid of anything dangerous nearby.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We can&#39;t invite her to the safety of the village, but we can make her home as safe as the village itself.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I want to do as much as I can to help.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Nothing less from our reliable Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Yeah, that&#39;s a great idea!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh? You want to hold hands?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Hah...joining hands, a show of trust and gratitude...a custom I&#39;ve never heard of before...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What a wonderful thing! I think I like this, [♂ Lysander /♀ Hermia]!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Already an attack by a beast from the forest!</p><hr><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> I&#39;ve distanced the girl from the beast.</p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> My bewitched strings will not allow it to get any closer to her.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Thank you, leave the rest to me! Foul beast, don&#39;t you dare touch her!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> How cruel it is...I dared to aim for a spot which would cause continuous pain.</p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> We can only hope that the beasts will now consider this place dangerous...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, it was the right thing to do.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Tristram, are you a former soldier? Or maybe a hunter?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Whatever you were, you were very good at it! I&#39;m sure the king that you served was very proud of you!</p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> That&#39;s...indeed. I hope so.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (That strumming...I don&#39;t understand how there&#39;s no magical energy involved when he conjures wind...)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (Is he a member of the Wind Clan? But his magical energy output is low...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m just glad we got rid of them.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Are you okay?</p><hr><p><strong>Nameless Fairy:</strong> Huh? Oh my, could it be...</p><p><strong>Nameless Fairy:</strong> Did you do that for me?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. [♂ Lysander /♀ Hermia] wasn&#39;t against it, so I came to check on you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You were attacked by those beasts. Are you injured?</p><p><strong>Nameless Fairy:</strong> Y-yes, but it&#39;s the same as always. I&#39;m fine, really.</p><p><strong>Nameless Fairy:</strong> So, what can I do for you? I&#39;ve already given you a tour of the village, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Oh, no, that&#39;s not why...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (So stupid...can&#39;t think of anything else. )</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We are here to thank you for yesterday.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Since you were so kind, I wanted to repay the favor by ensuring your home was protected from the beasts of this forest.</p><p><strong>Nameless Fairy:</strong> —</p><p><strong>Nameless Fairy:</strong> Huh!? Ehehehe...I&#39;m so happy. I&#39;m so happy...</p><p><strong>Nameless Fairy:</strong> I was of some use to you, wasn&#39;t I? It&#39;s been such a long time. I&#39;m so happy.</p><p><strong>Nameless Fairy:</strong> Oh right, here, take a blessing of good luck—a good luck—</p><p><strong>Nameless Fairy:</strong> I&#39;m sorry.... the blessing, I&#39;ve forgotten how to use it...</p><p><strong>Nameless Fairy:</strong> There&#39;s no roof over my head...nothing to give back, I don&#39;t have anything...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> No, it&#39;s okay. I&#39;ve already received a thank you.</p><hr><p><strong>Nameless Fairy:</strong> Really!?</p><p><strong>Nameless Fairy:</strong> I wonder...what if I gave you the flowers I picked this morning...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> [♂ Lysander /♀ Hermia], Tristram.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;ll put up a barrier to keep the beasts out. It will take some time, so you two should return to the village.</p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> Hmm? In that case, we should stay behind. We can&#39;t be sure that the beasts won&#39;t return.</p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> If you&#39;re putting up a barrier, [♂ Lysander /♀ Hermia] and I can protect you until you are finished.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s okay, I&#39;m strong enough to fight another one of those beasts.</p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> I see...what do you think, [♂ Lysander /♀ Hermia]?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I guess...if Mash says so.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> See you later! Have fun with the fairies in the village!</p><p><strong>Nameless Fairy:</strong> —.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s finished. Now, no beasts will be able to enter this area.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Well, it&#39;s no Sacrament, just magecraft, so it won&#39;t last forever...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It should still last for a few weeks. You&#39;ll be able to sleep peacefully without worrying.</p><p><strong>Nameless Fairy:</strong> “Magecraft”...the mysterious power that Her Majesty the Queen holds...</p><p><strong>Nameless Fairy:</strong> I see that you&#39;re able to use it too, Mash.</p><p><strong>Nameless Fairy:</strong> Maybe it&#39;s the fashionable thing at the moment?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ah—I wonder, maybe it will catch on...mine is half self-taught, though...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Maybe I ran away because I didn&#39;t want to learn it in the first place...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s a bit absurd to ask me to save Britain with something like “magecraft”, but...</p><p><strong>Nameless Fairy:</strong> Mash...?</p><p><strong>Nameless Fairy:</strong> I&#39;m sorry...did I say something weird?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> —N-no, not at all, it&#39;s a bad habit of mine.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s not your fault that I&#39;m in low spirits. So don&#39;t worry about it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s more like...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I think it&#39;s time for you to move on from that village.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s not that the fairies there are bad, but the village isn&#39;t a good fit for you.</p><p><strong>Nameless Fairy:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Salisbury wouldn&#39;t be bad, but...the Wind Clan might not be so friendly to you if your wings are damaged.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Perhaps Norwich then? I heard that fairies and humans live there together peacefully.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Maybe you can find a new “purpose” there. If you find the right person.</p><p><strong>Nameless Fairy:</strong> Thank you, Mash. But I&#39;m fine here.</p><p><strong>Nameless Fairy:</strong> Because...even if I found a new “purpose”, I don&#39;t have a name any more.</p><p><strong>Nameless Fairy:</strong> It&#39;s certainly been tiring...no matter what I do, no matter how much I try, I can never accomplish anything.</p><p><strong>Nameless Fairy:</strong> To forget my own name, the most important thing...I must have been truly desperate.</p><p><strong>Nameless Fairy:</strong> That&#39;s why...this is where I belong. I can&#39;t get blamed for my past ways here.</p><p><strong>Nameless Fairy:</strong> A failure who never managed to achieve her “purpose”. A terrible fairy who wasted away her life.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Nameless Fairy:</strong> But...that&#39;s right. It&#39;s all so depressing.</p><p><strong>Nameless Fairy:</strong> It&#39;s not the fact I&#39;m an ostracized by everyone in the village. My “purpose”, that was so important...</p><p><strong>Nameless Fairy:</strong> To forget even my own name...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I understand. Not having a name must be miserable.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Then, how about something like this? Really, it&#39;s just an idea I had just now...</p><p><strong>C：Fairy Girl:</strong> Thank you, Mash...it feels like the first time I&#39;ve ever been this happy...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh? I&#39;m a little embarrassed, you know...going that far—</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> —I see. If you&#39;re happy, I am happy too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But, this is our secret, okay? If anyone in the village heard about this, they&#39;d probably get angry...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> “Even in this abandoned village we have standards, don&#39;t bring your ridiculous habits to Cornwall! ”</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Or something like that.</p><p><strong>C：Fairy Girl:</strong> Right!? You can tell that Halobaromia used to be Lady Aurora&#39;s attendant.</p><p><strong>C：Fairy Girl:</strong> He still longs for “the elegant way of being a fairy. ”</p><p><strong>C：Fairy Girl:</strong> I really like that about Halobaromia.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, definitely! He acts all high and mighty, but I could tell at a glance that he still cares for the village.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> My...I&#39;ve talked a lot. I&#39;ve gotta get back to the village.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;ll come back and see you tomorrow. Sleep well.</p><p><strong>C：Fairy Girl:</strong> Yeah, bye-bye Mash. I&#39;ll see you tomorrow!</p><p><strong>C：Fairy Girl:</strong> See you...tomorrow...—huh, wh—</p><p><strong>C：Fairy Girl:</strong> What in the world...my right eye, it&#39;s really hurting...</p><p><strong>C：Fairy Girl:</strong> Puddles of tears...my eyes, what is happen—</p><p><strong>C：Fairy Girl:</strong> Oh.</p><p><strong>C：Fairy Girl:</strong> I see...the darkness is overtaking me, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>C：Fairy Girl:</strong> I wonder if it&#39;s over...just when I finally had something good happen...</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (Yawn) Good morning...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I had a great night&#39;s sleep...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Good morning. We were able to get to sleep early last night since there weren&#39;t any festivities.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What do you want to do today?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> If there&#39;s nothing we need to attend to, I&#39;ll head outside the village again...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> First, we&#39;ll get some breakfast outside...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> With no feast last night, I&#39;m very hungry...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Hm? Something wrong with your stomach?</p><p><strong>Halobaromia:</strong> Oh, good morning, [♂ Lysander /♀ Hermia]. I&#39;m sorry to have made you feel lonely last night.</p><p><strong>Halobaromia:</strong> I&#39;ll be able to prepare the festival properly today, so please look forward to it.</p><p><strong>Halobaromia:</strong> Huh? What&#39;s wrong? You don&#39;t look well. Is something the matter?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m sorry, I had nothing to eat yesterday...I&#39;m starving...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Do you have any food?</p><hr><p><strong>Halobaromia:</strong> —Huh? You haven&#39;t eaten any food, so you&#39;re hungry?</p><p><strong>Halobaromia:</strong> Haha, stop joking around. We&#39;re not humans. Eating is just for fun, you know?</p><p><strong>Halobaromia:</strong> Wait...no way. You&#39;re not really...? Now that I think about it, could it be—</p><p><strong>Halobaromia:</strong> Oh. My. God. I can&#39;t believe it! This is really happening...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Um, Halobaromia?</p><hr><p><strong>Halobaromia:</strong> Everybody! A human being! [♂ Lysander /♀ Hermia] is human! An unregistered human!!</p><p><strong>I：Fairies:</strong> Huh!? What rubbish are you spouting this early in the morning? There&#39;s no way in hell a human would be in this neck of the woods—</p><p><strong>Halobaromia:</strong> I&#39;m sure of it! [♂ His /♀ Her] wings aren&#39;t torn off. They&#39;re simply not there to begin with!</p><p><strong>Halobaromia:</strong> Everyone, gather round, quickly! If they get out into the woods, we&#39;re in deep trouble!</p><p><strong>Halobaromia:</strong> Oh, my God! If only I&#39;d realized sooner...!</p><p><strong>Halobaromia:</strong> I apologize, [♂ Lysander /♀ Hermia]! We&#39;ve shown you such poor hospitality!</p><p><strong>Halobaromia:</strong> We need to throw the most exquisite, fun welcome party we&#39;ve ever had! Oh, what a great day this is!</p><p><strong>J：Fairies:</strong> Let&#39;s see, let&#39;s see! Wow, it&#39;s true! [♂ Lysander /♀ Hermia] is actually human!?</p><p><strong>I：Fairies:</strong> You&#39;re human, a human! No wonder we feel so much better when we&#39;re with you!</p><p><strong>K：Fairies:</strong> Now we&#39;re all saved! We won&#39;t have to become Mors!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Huh...huh!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (Are we...in trouble...? )</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Damn it! That&#39;s right, [♂ Lysander /♀ Hermia], if you say that you&#39;re hungry...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh no! The secret is out!</p><p><strong>K：Fairies:</strong> Are you human too? You&#39;re human too, aren&#39;t you!? No wings, and no command spells!</p><p><strong>J：Fairies:</strong> Then what about that harpist dude? Is he a human? No, he&#39;s a fairy!</p><p><strong>I：Fairies:</strong> He hasn&#39;t eaten anything! Well whatever, it&#39;s a pain, so we&#39;ll put them together!</p><p><strong>Halobaromia:</strong> [♂ Lysander /♀ Hermia], Mash, Tristram! Please, you must move to the best place in the village!</p><p><strong>Halobaromia:</strong> In the center of the village, in the square, in the tent! Oh, this is exciting!</p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> So...</p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> Half a day has passed since we were forced into this tent, without knowing why...</p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> Every hour, what can be called nothing less than a feast is brought to us...[♂ Lysander /♀ Hermia], is it good?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s good, but I&#39;ve lost my appetite...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It feels welcoming, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> We&#39;re not allowed to go outside, and the fairies take turns guarding the tent...</p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> This is less of a welcome and more of what you would call “house arrest”. No, it&#39;s simply imprisonment.</p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> Mash. Do you know why this is happening to us?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s because...[♂ Lysander /♀ Hermia] is really a human.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I saw the way you were indulging yourself in those delicious fruits, but...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I should have noticed, too. But then again, I&#39;ve never really seen a human before, so...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Mash, are you also human?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Mash, are you a fairy?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Well...I&#39;m really not sure.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I think I&#39;m a fairy...but I&#39;ve also been told I&#39;m a bit like a human...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> More importantly, this is the situation we&#39;re in.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> [♂ Lysander /♀ Hermia] is being overindulged at the moment, and this is only going to get worse.</p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> Much worse.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. Humans are an indispensable source of nourishment for fairies.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The mere presence of a human greatly increases morale. It&#39;s a kind of spiritual fulfillment.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But in Britain, the number of humans is tightly controlled by the Queen, so...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Humans are not assigned to lower class fairies.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The fairies that have drifted into this village are, after all, those that have fallen out due to the lack of humans.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So, you know...they&#39;ll take care of [♂ Lysander /♀ Hermia] either way.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But...</p><p><strong>Fairies:</strong> Humans! Humans! Humans in this village!</p><p><strong>Fairies:</strong> Not a rebel good-for-nothing, not a spy for the Queen, but a decent, honest, human being!</p><p><strong>Fairies:</strong> What joy, what joy! We must protect him, he can&#39;t get hurt!</p><p><strong>Fairies:</strong> You gotta spice the food up, just nuts and fruits won&#39;t work.</p><p><strong>Fairies:</strong> Let&#39;s hunt, hunt, get some meat from the forest! It&#39;s a favorite of humans, I was taught!</p><p><strong>Fairies:</strong> Oh, how I envy those guards. I can&#39;t wait for it to be my turn.</p><p><strong>Fairies:</strong> I wish I could be closer. I&#39;d make them laugh, be embarrassed, make them cry,</p><p><strong>Fairies:</strong> comb their hair, rub their fingers, peel their skin...</p><p><strong>Fairies:</strong> But there are only two of them, right? How come Halobaromia gets to call the shots?</p><p><strong>Fairies:</strong> We&#39;re not all gonna have a chance. I&#39;ll never get my turn.</p><p><strong>Fairies:</strong> That&#39;s right. Then we&#39;ll tear [♂ him /♀ her] apart and share [♂ him /♀ her] with everyone!</p><p><strong>Fairies:</strong> Dibs on the left eye! You can have the right!</p><p><strong>Fairies:</strong> Yeah, yeah! I get a ring finger! You get a middle finger!</p><p><strong>Fairies:</strong> We did it! Now it&#39;s all divided equally!</p><p><strong>Doga:</strong> Oy, what the hell are you guys doing? It&#39;s not your turn yet. Get back on the roof.</p><p><strong>Doga:</strong> Don&#39;t you dare do anything crazy to [♂ Lysander /♀ Hermia]. He&#39;s a great shot.</p><p><strong>Doga:</strong> He hits the ball with his head, man. With his head! I&#39;ve never seen anything like that!</p><p><strong>Doga:</strong> He&#39;s an interesting guy, you know. I&#39;m sure our lives would be a lot more fun with him around—</p><p><strong>Fairies:</strong> Doga is so annoying. We don&#39;t care for annoying people.</p><p><strong>Fairies:</strong> It can&#39;t be helped, there&#39;s only two of them. It can&#39;t be helped, there&#39;s only two of them.</p><p><strong>Fairies:</strong> We&#39;ll tear them apart and share them with everyone! Tear them apart and share them with everyone!</p><p><strong>Fairies:</strong> But we&#39;re the only ones who will get a share! Only those in the Fang Clan!</p><p><strong>Fairies:</strong> Earth and Wind are annoying. Let&#39;s beat them to the chase!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That sound...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> The sound of fighting...?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> I can&#39;t see what is going on, but there seems to be a squabble going on among the fairies.</p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> Perhaps the discussion about which clan will monopolize you has fallen apart.</p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> No matter, your life is in danger if we stay here. We must leave the village as soon as possible.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> But, the guards...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Out of the village, to where...?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Let&#39;s head to the plains east of here. Through the abandoned villages and into the plains of Britain.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Once we get there, there&#39;s a national highway. We can then figure out which city to head to next.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But in order to do that, we&#39;ll first have to deal with the guards outside...</p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> I very much doubt myself and Mash can neutralize them alone...</p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> Fairies, whatever they may be, are undoubtedly very powerful creatures. It&#39;s not something humans can hope to win again—oh?</p><p><strong>Fairy Girl:</strong> Thank goodness. You&#39;re all still safe, right?</p><p><strong>Fairy Girl:</strong> The villagers were acting strangely all morning, so I was watching from afar...</p><p><strong>Fairy Girl:</strong> It&#39;s a bit of a mess...everyone is shouting abuse at each other and starting to fight...</p><p><strong>Fairy Girl:</strong> Halobaromia has been trying to calm everyone down, but maybe it&#39;s time to—</p><p><strong>Onfam:</strong> Hey, keep your eyes open. Don&#39;t let anyone near the tent.</p><p><strong>Onfam:</strong> We&#39;ve killed all the wind guys, but the fanged ones are still here.</p><p><strong>Onfam:</strong> After all, we can&#39;t have those veggie bastards stealing our humans. Us Earth fairies have to share equally, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Onfam—</p><hr><p><strong>Fairy Girl:</strong> Stop, [♂ Lysander /♀ Hermia]. They&#39;re not what they used to be.</p><p><strong>Fairy Girl:</strong> They&#39;re drunk on blood and turning increasingly more and more violent.</p><p><strong>Fairy Girl:</strong> Now, head over to where I crept in. The cloth isn&#39;t taut, so you should be able to slip under it.</p><p><strong>Fairy Girl:</strong> You want to leave the forest, don&#39;t you...? Then leave it to me.</p><p><strong>Fairy Girl:</strong> I know the way to the plains. Come on, quickly!</p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> That&#39;s the Earth Clan? They&#39;ve completely transformed...</p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> It&#39;s saddening...I have to say, they&#39;re like the devil himself...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Tristram, don&#39;t use your harp! They&#39;ll hear you!</p><p><strong>The Voice of Onfam:</strong> Huh? Hey, did you hear something?</p><p><strong>The Voice of Onfam:</strong> It could be a Wind Clan survivor. Ketheli, Gum. You guys, go check it out.</p><p><strong>The Voice of Onfam:</strong> The rest of us will head for the tent. We&#39;ll crush their legs first. Then they won&#39;t be able to escape.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> This is bad! We&#39;ve gotta get out of here!</p><hr><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> I&#39;m sorry, for some reason, my fingers are moving on their own...</p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> Just get out of this village! I&#39;ll bring up the rear!</p><p><strong>Fairy Girl:</strong> Everyone, this way! Follow me!</p><p><strong>Fairy Girl:</strong> Hah...hah...hah...</p><p><strong>Fairy Girl:</strong> Yeah, this is the right way...three more hills, then we&#39;ll reach the middle plains...</p><p><strong>Fairy Girl:</strong> Everyone, how are you doing? We&#39;ve been running without a break so far, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Somehow, I&#39;m okay...!</p><hr><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> Yes. There were two fairies that followed us, but it seems they lost us around the first hill.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> They must have gotten lost in the fog.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> They lived in the village, and she lived outside of it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m sure that made all the difference. Thank you very much for guiding us.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But...was it really okay to do that?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Now that you&#39;ve saved us, you can&#39;t ever go back to the village...</p><p><strong>Fairy Girl:</strong> Yeah. I can&#39;t go near there any more.</p><p><strong>Fairy Girl:</strong> But don&#39;t worry about it, Mash.</p><p><strong>Fairy Girl:</strong> Thanks to you, my home will be safe for a while.</p><p><strong>Fairy Girl:</strong> But sooner than that, as soon as possible...we have to get out of the woods.</p><p><strong>Fairy Girl:</strong> Faster, faster...faster than everyone else in the village...</p><p><strong>Fairy Girl:</strong> A little, further...if I could just get you all...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;re out of breath, are you okay?</p><p><strong>Fairy Girl:</strong> I am, out of breath...? I see. But, we&#39;re almost there...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> There&#39;s something on your face...?</p><p><strong>Fairy Girl:</strong> Huh? What are you talking about, something on my face?</p><hr><p><strong>Fairy Girl:</strong> Oh, the smell of the wind...the nostalgic, earthy smell of Salisbury...</p><p><strong>Fairy Girl:</strong> We&#39;re almost out of the woods...almost...almost...</p><p><strong>Fairy Girl:</strong> Beautiful Britain, nostalgic Britain...my world, when I still had a name...</p><p><strong>Fairy Girl:</strong> Fufu...fufufu...almost there...almost there...</p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> Hm. There&#39;s a slope ahead. It must be the last hill.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> If we go over that hill, we should exit the forest...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Thank you, friendly fairy. Thanks to you, we&#39;re safe...wait, what&#39;s wrong!?</p><p><strong>Fairy Girl:</strong> Ugh, ouch, ouch, ouch...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Get a hold of yourself! Does your body hurt!? Let me help—</p><p><strong>Fairy Girl:</strong> Uaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Shut up! Just shut up!</p><p><strong>Fairy Girl:</strong> Get your hands off me! Don&#39;t touch meeeeee!</p><p><strong>Fairy Girl:</strong> I want to stay, I want to stay, I want to stay...!</p><p><strong>Fairy Girl:</strong> I&#39;ve been here for hundreds of years, alone for hundreds of years!</p><p><strong>Fairy Girl:</strong> I was forced to do all the things I couldn&#39;t do, they just built up and up!</p><p><strong>Fairy Girl:</strong> Nobody ever helped me before! Nobody even looked at me!</p><p><strong>Fairy Girl:</strong> Now, now, I didn&#39;t need those things after all!</p><p><strong>Fairy Girl:</strong> Are you all stupid!? Don&#39;t you understand!? You&#39;ve been tricked, you guys!</p><p><strong>Fairy Girl:</strong> Of course I brought you all the way out here!

She...is no longer a fairy.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s a Mors...life that can no longer speak or hear.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The black algae that pollutes this world with its existence—the curse of Britain, killer of fairies.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I think we got it, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ......</p><hr><p><strong>Mors:</strong> —, —.</p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> Be careful...looks like it has some power left.</p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> But, it&#39;s not doing anything...does it want to say something...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Excuse me.</p><p><strong>Mors:</strong> —...—, —...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Forgive my rudeness. Delivering the blow of mercy must have been too heavy a burden for you.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> So, as someone who knows the Mors, I delivered it myself.</p><p><strong>Tristram:</strong> (From behind, a swift blow from a rapier, as smooth as the wind...! And this intimate sensation—)</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I&#39;m sorry...may you rest in peace. May your next life be rewarding.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No way—you&#39;re—you&#39;re—</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Hi. Good to see you, Fujimaru. Sorry it took me so long to get here.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Although, I guess you&#39;re a bit confused why I&#39;ve come to meet you. Fufu, I can see it already in your face.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Alright. It&#39;s a bit strange for a king like me to do this, but since I don&#39;t have any subjects with me now, I&#39;ll introduce myself.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> My name is Oberon. I&#39;m a Heroic Spirit summoned by the Human Order.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I&#39;m the only servant destined to help you in this Lostbelt.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Call me Oberon, King of the Fairies.

Pretty cool, huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Right...my name is Fujimaru!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> And Tristram</p><hr><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Yes, let us recall our names—</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> You are Fujimaru, Master of Chaldea. I am Tristan the Lamenting, Knight of the Spectral Strings.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> I finally remember everything. And...Mash.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> You...you aren&#39;t named Mash.</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong> Oberon...? Not Merlin, then...?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Merlin?</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong> No no, sorry. I&#39;ve got the wrong person, or the wrong image in my head.</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong> You are similar to the person I had envisioned...</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong> Ahem. I remember too.</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong> My name is Caster. Artoria Caster.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> It&#39;s a long and embarrassing story.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Caster was my name back in the village, but please call me Artoria.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> It&#39;s such a relief that you have your names back. Ah, but if we aren&#39;t quick, we&#39;ll get swallowed up by the fog again.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Come on, make haste. Our goal is just beyond those trees.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> You should see the real Britain first. We&#39;ll catch up afterwards.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> The real Britain...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Sure, but we have to get out first...!</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Yes! Let&#39;s go, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> A utopia loved by wind, earth, life, poetry and rain—</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> To Britain, the twilit island of fairies!</p><h2 id="fragment-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#fragment-1" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Fragment / 1</h2><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Meanwhile...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> How many days had it been since she and Fujimaru were separated? Just moments earlier, she had escaped the Nameless Forest alone.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Was it a difference in power as a Servant? Or was it simply good luck?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> No, unfortunately, both of those are wrong. The Mors just swallowed her up, and spat her back out.</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong> Hah...hah...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> And the results are plain to see.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> With her strength exhausted and her armaments scattered, she had collapsed in front of the national highway.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> It was bad, it was bad! It was really, really bad! Because, if you stay in a place like that...</p><p><strong>C：Fairy Peddlers:</strong> Well, look at that! I figured there&#39;d be one or two here this time of the season.</p><p><strong>C：Fairy Peddlers:</strong> Look at this, one of the Wind Clan&#39;s finest! Now we can all get through the winter!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>As you can see, fairies who stray too far out of the woods make easy prey for slavers!</p><p><strong>D：Fairy Peddlers:</strong> Hey, get the collar on before she wakes up! I don&#39;t know who she is, but it&#39;s all the same if we can sell her!</p><p><strong>D：Fairy Peddlers:</strong> I&#39;ll sell her to a lord and get a fat paycheck, and she&#39;ll get a warm body next to her in bed...</p><p><strong>D：Fairy Peddlers:</strong> It&#39;s a win-win— Eek, a beast! It&#39;s a wolf!</p><p><strong>White Wolf:</strong> GuRuuuuuuuu...!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> But, it doesn&#39;t always work out like that. That&#39;s my favorite part.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> At her side were the white fangs of the wise Grimm. No insolent fairy could approach her.</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong> Mmm...</p><p><strong>D：Fairy Peddlers:</strong> Crap, she woke up...! Oh no, oh no! She&#39;s too strong!

We&#39;re here to help you, young lady.</p><p><strong>E：Fairy Peddlers:</strong> Come take a ride on our cart. It&#39;s the latest Norwich model, so it&#39;s really comfortable.</p><p><strong>C：Fairy Peddlers:</strong> One to pull, two to laugh. Two rest, one gets tired!</p><p><strong>C：Fairy Peddlers:</strong> What, no need to worry. You&#39;re valuable goo—I mean, an important customer, young lady.</p><p><strong>C：Fairy Peddlers:</strong> I&#39;m not gonna force you to pull the cart.

You&#39;re not going to use “Achin” like always? Well, occasionally you come up with something different...</p><p><strong>E：Fairy Peddlers:</strong> You alright with that, Annis? Here, let me help you up.</p><p><strong>E：Fairy Peddlers:</strong> If you keep lying on the ground like that, you&#39;ll be eaten by the Awd Goggie!</p><p><strong>A：Annis:</strong> Ah...thank you...very much...</p><p><strong>D：Fairy Peddlers:</strong> Hey, what&#39;s that?

What should we do, brother!?</p><p><strong>E：Fairy Peddlers:</strong> You mess with that white beast and you&#39;ll regret it.

This is the heartland of the British Lostbelt.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> If you look over there, you&#39;ll see what looks like an evil castle. That&#39;s Camelot.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> The current Britain is divided into north and south, with Camelot at its center.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Most of everyone lives in the south, or what we are in the middle of right now.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> The cathedral city of Salisbury, the port town of Norwich, the trendy city of Gloucester, and the great dining city of Oxford.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Those are the four main cities. Each of them is governed by what you could call a clan “head” fairy.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Sorry, but what about Mash and da Vinci!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> There were two others!</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Ah...I see. You came here with other friends from Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I&#39;m really sorry...you&#39;re the only one I could find.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> As you can see, I was the only one taking action. I had my hands full looking for one person.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> But this is perfect, maybe you can tell me about this Mash girl.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> As long as we know what she looks like, we can track her down. I&#39;ll have Blanca look for you.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Blanca...? You said you were by yourself, but you had other friends?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Whoops, you&#39;re right. I&#39;ll introduce you.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Isn&#39;t she cute and fluffy? She&#39;s my advisor...or should I say friend?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> She&#39;s tidy, smart, and above all, a hard worker.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll find this Mash of yours.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Now that that&#39;s settled, let&#39;s exchange what we know.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> You tell me about Chaldea, I&#39;ll tell you what I know.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...and that about sums it up.</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I see...you&#39;ve conquered five Lostbelts up to now.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Britain wasn&#39;t the target of an attack, merely to investigate the Collapse,</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Mash, Leonardo, Tristan, and Fujimaru,</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> the four of you made landfall in Britain, but lost track of each other in the Nameless Forest...</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> That&#39;s a problem. No, it&#39;s my fault. It&#39;s not just you that were lost...</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> If I had paid more attention then, I might have been able to go after Mash and Leonardo.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I was so excited I found you, that I forgot about everything else...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I knew it, the last thing I saw on the beach was you, Oberon?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> With that fog I don&#39;t think you had a choice...</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> —You&#39;re probably right. But, there&#39;s something I need to check first.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Mash is your contracted Servant, right? Then you&#39;re connected through a path of magical energy.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> So long as she&#39;s all right, you may not know where she is, but you should know she&#39;s still alive.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Well? As a Master, you should be able to do that much, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> My connection to Mash is still active!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;m so relieved...</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Good. Then all that&#39;s left is to find her.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Leonardo&#39;s a Servant as well, right? Then a little thing like that shouldn&#39;t be a problem.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Fortunately, the fairies here can&#39;t tell the difference between fairies and Servants.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> As long as you&#39;re not human, it&#39;s not that dangerous. Trust in your friends and don&#39;t lose your head.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Right, next. Artoria, anything you want to say to me?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> N-no, not right now. Chaldea, Pan-human History, Lostbelts...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I&#39;ve never heard any of this before, so it&#39;s all over my head...ahaha...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> But, um, Servants, was it? A Heroic Spirit...is it like a human who becomes a fairy after death?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> So for example, someone like Tristram...no, I mean Tristan here?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Mm. For an explanation of Heroic Spirits and Servants, Fujimaru can tell you more on the road.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> A citizen of the Lostbelt and a Master from pan-human history. You two can fill the gaps in each other&#39;s knowledge.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> On the road...do you have somewhere to go, Oberon?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Yeah, we do. If we&#39;re looking for someone, we have to go to a big city.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> You and Fujimaru need to get used to the rules of the Fairy Kingdom.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> We&#39;re headed to Salisbury, the biggest city in the south. We can get food, clothing and all the basics there.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> From here, it&#39;ll take a whole day. You look like you&#39;ve been up all night, can you walk?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Of course.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Good answer. Half enthusiastic, half composed. I like you, Fujimaru</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I can&#39;t just rest...!</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Whoa, hold on there. I know how you feel, but didn&#39;t I just say to calm down?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Britain&#39;s a big place. If you&#39;re not careful, you&#39;ll collapse before you find Mash.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Come on. Just as you can confirm she&#39;s safe as a Master,</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> my instincts tell me she&#39;s safe as well.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> After all, I&#39;m the Fairy King. My hunches are spot-on. First up is Salisbury.</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> S-Salisbury, you say?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> (Hmm, what should I do...going back now might be too dangerous...)</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> (But I can&#39;t leave Fujimaru alone...)</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> (I know I said it before, but this Oberon person is really Merlin-esque...)</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> U-um! Is it alright if I accompany you!?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I was the one who used Mash&#39;s name by accident...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I&#39;d at least like to hear all about Fujimaru&#39;s circumstances and about pan-human history!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Sorry, I assumed you would be coming along...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Ah, that&#39;s right, you weren&#39;t involved...!</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Ye-yes, I am!! Why am I acting so brazen...!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Yes. Nobody would like a bumpkin like me around...huh?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> You&#39;re holding out your hand...is this another handshaking?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Are you saying it&#39;s okay for me to come with you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Of course. We&#39;d be glad to have you, Artoria.</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> —Yeah. What a beautiful friendship.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I was on edge in Cornwall, but turns out I made the right choice by not helping.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> It&#39;s a theatrical way of saying “all the actors are assembled, now raise the curtain! ” don&#39;t you think?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Chaldea can&#39;t do it alone. And just the Child of Prophecy won&#39;t be enough.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Yes—after all, it will take both of them to defeat the all-powerful Morgan.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Fairies:</strong> Ah, the prophecy was true. That child is our shining hope.</p><p><strong>Fairies:</strong> With this, we are saved. With this, we are forgiven.</p><p><strong>Fairies:</strong> A Savior was washed ashore on board a boat bearing many treasures.</p><p><strong>Fairies:</strong> Recite the name of promise, hear and deliver the voice of paradise.</p><p><strong>Fairies:</strong> Oh, my beloved Artoria.</p><p><strong>Fairies:</strong> May you grow healthy and strong to the age of 16. May the Queen&#39;s soldiers never find you.</p><p><strong>Fairies:</strong> You must journey to ring the six bells and save Britain. You must journey to make way for the true king.</p><p><strong>Fairies:</strong> Gloucester, Salisbury, Oxford, Norwich, Orkney.</p><p><strong>Fairies:</strong> The sixth and final one is not in the prophecy, but you will surely find it.</p><p><strong>Fairies:</strong> Chosen by the Staff of Selection, you are the only hope of the Fairy Kingdom.</p><p><strong>Fairies:</strong> —Now, hurry. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry.</p><p><strong>Fairies:</strong> Hurry, and reach 16 years of age. We believe in your everything.</p><p><strong>Fairy:</strong> ...the village is done for. The executioners are already here.</p><p><strong>Fairy:</strong> Lift your head. Grasp your staff. It&#39;s time for you to set out, Artoria.</p><p><strong>Fairy:</strong> No matter what anybody says, or even if you doubt it yourself, you are definitely the Child of Prophecy.</p><p><strong>Fairy:</strong> You&#39;re just like her, kiddo.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m sorry...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m so weak...I&#39;m sorry I let you down...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I&#39;m trying...I&#39;m trying...I&#39;m trying as hard as I can...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Mmh...mmh...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Artoria, are you already asleep...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You&#39;re in front of a bonfire, so...you know...</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> —Uwa!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Did I just doze off!? Tristan was playing his lyre...and so...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> How saddening...my kin—ahem, excuse me.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> My lyre appears to not to be to Lady Artoria&#39;s taste...I merely attempted to ease her fatigue in my own way, but...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Ehehe...sorry, I&#39;m a little new to music.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> But, it&#39;s good to know I&#39;ll sleep well! Please let me listen later, when it&#39;s time for bed!</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Lady Artoria does not understand the heart of a poet...ah, how painful...</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Can&#39;t be helped. We walked all day to get this far.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I&#39;m tired as well. Let&#39;s rest here for tonight and get to Salisbury tomorrow morning.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Artoria, can you ward the area against beasts? I&#39;m sorry to ask you while you&#39;re drowsy, but...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Y-yes. I&#39;ll be off now.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Well then...</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> On the way here, we explained to Artoria that pan-human history was just the “world next door. ”</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> But, that&#39;s not really true. pan-human history is the correct way of things, and is mutually exclusive from this Fairy Kingdom of Britain.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> You Chaldeans have to destroy this Lostbelt.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> You&#39;re worried about how you&#39;re going to break the truth to Artoria, aren&#39;t you? You want to avoid hurting her as much as possible.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yeah...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Hiding it is in itself a betrayal, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I see. You&#39;re up to five now, aren&#39;t you? Each time, you&#39;ve betrayed the people of the Lostbelt.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Sheesh...I&#39;m proud to be a chatterbox, but...</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Finding the right thing to say about your traumas isn&#39;t easy.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Right. So, that&#39;s why I&#39;ll just reassure you here.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Don&#39;t worry, Fujimaru. This Lostbelt won&#39;t be destroyed by you.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> After all, it&#39;s trying to destroy itself. Actually, I think this time you&#39;ll be the one to save it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> To save...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> The Lostbelt?</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Yeah. This Britain isn&#39;t “just another prosperous human history. ”</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> It&#39;s a defective world that will die if left alone. In a word, it is a “mistaken history”.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> The problem is its destruction would have after-effects on pan-human history.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> As the ones on the side of that, we have to save Britain at all costs.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> To overthrow the one who has lorded over this land for two thousand years—Queen Morgan.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Ah! Hold up. By Morgan, you mean that Morgan?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Yeah, the very same.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> The great Achilles&#39; heel of King Arthur, who ruled over Britain in pan-human history.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> The peerless witch who, in order to get into Camelot, set many traps,</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> and who used her own child with Arthur—Mordred, the Knight of Treachery.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> The woman who brought Britain to ruin, Morgan. That&#39;s the name of the queen who will bring this Fairy Kingdom to ruin.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Well, I guess you all would call her the “Lostbelt King? ” Is that right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Queen Morgan—</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> King Arthur&#39;s archfoe, in this Lostbelt...</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Anyway, from what I&#39;ve heard, the problems in the outside world are probably being caused by her.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> As long as Morgan is defeated, pan-human history should be in the clear.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> What happens after that, you can leave up to this island&#39;s original fate.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Whether it destroys itself or manages to recover, that&#39;s not your cross to bear.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Look. A Lostbelt needs a Fantasy Tree to maintain its existence, right?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> It&#39;s probably that world tree you see beyond that ocean...the huge ash tree-looking thing, but. .</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> As you can see, it died a while back. That&#39;s why this Lostbelt doesn&#39;t have much longer to live.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It died a while ago...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Didn&#39;t it burn up?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Yeah, it was all ablaze a little while back! It went out pretty quick, but I wonder what that was all about?</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Well, let&#39;s wrap it up for tonight. It&#39;s not good to cram too much information in at once.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> To sum up tonight:</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> “The Fairy Kingdom&#39;s ruler is Queen Morgan! Kick her ass! ”</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> That&#39;s all you need to know.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> We&#39;ll continue this when we reach Salisbury.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> You&#39;ll really get the feeling of Britain when you see an actual fairy city—</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Sorry to drop the middle of a conversation, but we&#39;ve got monsters! Fujimaru, get ready for combat!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I&#39;m sooooorryyyyyyyy!! I screwed up the warding spells...!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Now I attracted a flock of wild birds...! Please help me!</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> —Heh. For my king to ask for assistance, what a—</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Excuse me...she is not King Arthur. How embarrassing, for me of all people...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (I see, Tristan is—)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Even if she&#39;s someone else, you can be happy!</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Yes...I feel sorry for the other Rounds. This is a great honor.</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Here they come! Britain&#39;s beasts are ferocious! Be careful, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Yay! An overwhelming victory! That felt great!</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> A refreshing victory for the first time since I was summoned...I am overjoyed...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> We&#39;ve had it rough so far...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Indeed. We may not be as good as fairies, but a demonic beast such as this is no match for a Knight of the Round Table.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Artoria, are you...(actually a sore loser? )</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Ah no, it&#39;s nothing, nothing at all. I&#39;m just glad to be able to play an active role, ahaha...</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I see. So that&#39;s what you guys are capable of now. Even a pack of nachtkrapp are no trouble for you.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> That&#39;s good. Better than expected, even.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Tristan&#39;s bow is less powerful, but has great range.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> His specialty is group combat. With you here, we don&#39;t have to worry about being outnumbered.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> And Artoria, who&#39;s not as tomboyish as she looks. Is that marvelous device of yours handmade?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Strange weapons are useful against new enemies. They can be a good distraction.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> And—</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Above it all, Fujimaru&#39;s summoning is hilarious!</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Temporarily summoning Heroic Spirits...your ability to respond and overcome is beyond expectations.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Human magecraft isn&#39;t very effective on fairies. But if you summon Heroic Spirits, it&#39;s a different story.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I guess the issue is Fujimaru&#39;s physical strength? Physical power, magical energy, and karmic power.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> The longer the battle continues, the more danger you&#39;ll be in as the summoner.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> So long as you mind that, you&#39;ll be able to manage against fairies, probably.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Wait a second. Human magecraft...magecraft is...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Fujimaru, you use magecraft!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yeah, thanks to my Mystic Code, I guess.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Is it that surprising?</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> —</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Oh no, I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m just a little astonished...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Magecraft isn&#39;t used all that much in Britain, so...well...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Since fairies perform Sacraments without the use of things like a Thaumaturgical Foundation, Magic Formula, or Mystic Codes...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Magecraft is viewed as “something you don&#39;t need” or “something only used by weirdos. ”</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> To put it bluntly, if you can only use magecraft, they say “Eww, you have to prepare each thing separately,”</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> and everyone looks down on you...ahaha...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> I see. Indeed, fairies have no need of magecraft.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Since this Britain is a fairyland, you could say the value of magecraft is almost nil...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Then, why does Artoria use it?</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Uwa, you asked...after all that, you asked, Fujimaru...</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Now now. It was just a simple question. There was no malice in it, okay Artoria?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> If it&#39;s a sore subject, you don&#39;t have to answer.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> And Fujimaru, let&#39;s talk about this some other time. Have a little tact, okay?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Now then, did you all forget what our original plan was? We went through all that, just to sleep out here.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> We&#39;ll get a good night&#39;s sleep tonight.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Artoria probably wants to know more about Fujimaru too, but save that for tomorrow morning.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> —</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Luckily, there aren&#39;t any of the Queen&#39;s soldiers, Mors, or rebels in the area.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> We&#39;ll wake up in the morning, walk an hour, and be in Salisbury.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> We&#39;ll have a more in-depth conversation then. Let&#39;s save the fun stuff for when we&#39;re more composed, in better surroundings, alright?</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So, that&#39;s a rough history of the world until 2015 AD.</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Wow...so another world really existed...England...Scotland...Ireland...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Not only that, but outside of the island, there&#39;s France? And Italy? And so on.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> So many countries, so many people, each and every one with their own culture...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I can&#39;t imagine what it must be like to come from such a wonderful place.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> But a “Britain without fairies”! That sounds refreshing and interesting!</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> From Fujimaru&#39;s point of view, I think this fairyland Britain is the more interesting one.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> But, there&#39;s something to be corrected here.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Pan-human history...it&#39;s wrong to say that there are no fairies in Fujimaru&#39;s world.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Despite the fact that Mystery faded with the transition into the common era, the fairies do remain.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> There are not many of them left, and they seldom show themselves in front of other people. I actually sort of fall into that category as a Heroic Spirit.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Speaking of which, Oberon...</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> “A Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream”, right?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Shakespeare, the greatest English playwright who ever lived. He wrote a story about fairies.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> The story...to put it simply, it&#39;s a love triangle between three humans.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> The fairy King is Oberon. His estranged Queen is called Titania.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Oberon, in an attempt to get Titania to give up her changeling, concocts a magical potion.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> When applied to the eyelids of a sleeping person, that person, upon waking, falls in love with the first living being that they set their eyes on.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> A human named Lysander, having been mistaken for another human and having the love potion accidently applied,</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> forgets his days with the love of his life, Hermia, to whom he had pledged his future, and believes someone else to be his eternal lover.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Well, a lot happens, and in the end, they get back together.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> It&#39;s a self-serving play about love, a light comedy...</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> The problem is, it became a popular play that was passed down from generation to generation.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Thanks to this, fairies like “Puck the Trickster”, and “Oberon the hard-hearted Fairy King” are now well established.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> So...I guess you could say, I&#39;m the most famous fairy in the entire world.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> If you&#39;re interested, you can always read it after you return to Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> He&#39;s a hopeless king who can&#39;t do anything right, but be lenient with him.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I swear there was no harm intended, okay?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> It was an overdramatic stage scene, so I could get my darling to pay attention to me.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Then is Oberon a fictional fairy? A character only found in the story?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> How can something so ambiguous become a Servant?</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Not so. Shakespeare&#39;s “A Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream” is one of the greatest plays ever written, but...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> “Oberon, King of the Fairies” is said to be a legend that has been handed down in Europe since time immemorial.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Even before Shakespeare&#39;s time, in the 15th century.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> He was heralded as “the king of fairies, whom can fulfill any desire using magic. ”</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Really? I didn&#39;t know that.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> For what it&#39;s worth, they both had an original inspiration. That “inspiration”...that&#39;s who was recorded as a Servant.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Perhaps, that&#39;s who I am. It&#39;s like trying to determine which came first, the chicken or the egg.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I see...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> And, what about Titania?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> That&#39;s a total Shakespearean creation. There is no such name in traditional fairy history.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Titania...a corruption of Titan, perhaps? A creation from Greek mythology?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> The Oberon in “A Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream” is an egoist.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Any woman who could forgive his selfishness would only exist in fiction.</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Anyway...sorry, I&#39;m wasting your time talking about this.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Salisbury is up ahead. I&#39;ll deal with the gatekeeper.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> You guys stay quiet and follow me. I mean, they&#39;ll recognise me.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Also, if they ask you for your name, don&#39;t answer them. If they press for it, make something up.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> If they find out you&#39;re a human, you&#39;re in trouble. You never know who&#39;ll be listening.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Wait...is is not risky to lie to fairies?</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> It is said that their eyes can see through lies. Isn&#39;t avoiding falsehoods of the utmost importance?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Ah, don&#39;t worry. The fairies here don&#39;t have Fairy Eyes.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Maybe their ability was lost to time, or abandoned for the greater good.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Regardless, they can&#39;t see your true feelings. Until the results come in, they can&#39;t tell good from bad.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> After all, if they had them, how could an evil like Morgan prosper?</p><p>Note! Scene Change</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> This is Salisbury...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> There&#39;s a big cathedral...!</p><hr><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> I&#39;m glad. The air here is different from Cornwall.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> There are fairies everywhere, but I do not sense any immediate danger from them...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Everyone is smiling, with an air of positivity. Perhaps there is a festival taking place.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> No, it&#39;s just the way things are in this city. It&#39;s Britain&#39;s only free city.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> The population is about 200,000 here in Salisbury. Not just from the Wind, Earth, and Fang clans—</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> It&#39;s home to both natural fairies and humans who have gained the right to independence.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> A human who has gained independence?</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> “Belonging to nobody, but Britain itself”, a free human, if you will.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I thought we&#39;d talk about that when we were a bit more settled...</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> It&#39;s not something that can be kept secret forever. There&#39;s also the matter of the cathedral. I&#39;ll explain now.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> You came to the conclusion that there were no humans here in this Fairy Kingdom, but strictly speaking, that&#39;s not entirely true.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Humans exist. But they&#39;re not the apex species of this world.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> They&#39;re tools for the enrichment of fairy society...almost like the slaves of pan-human history.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Doesn&#39;t this city seem a little bit off to you? There&#39;s something strange about it. Something that doesn&#39;t belong.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> If you ask me...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It feels like a human city.</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Yes. Originally, the fairies lived alongside nature.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Even if they did band together, they were just a gathering of forest children and stone children under the Great Mother.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Fairies were Bunrei—offshoot spirits— with no concept of a “civilization of their own”.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> However, here in the Fairy Kingdom, as you can see, they&#39;ve imitated human society.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> For about 14,000 years now.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> These British fairies have been breeding humans, and continued to thrive using their creativity as entertainment.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Fairies have long lives, strong vitality, and can live just fine in the spur of the moment.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Thanks to their strong versatility, human-like “growth and development” isn&#39;t needed. On the other hand, humans are riddled with weaknesses.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> They&#39;re short-lived, their injuries don&#39;t heal, they need to eat constantly, and they&#39;ll quickly end up dead if ambushed by a wild beast.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Inevitably, humans have had to accumulate knowledge and devise ways to survive and prosper.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> The human mindset must have been “charming and fascinating” to the fairies.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> They reared humans, and built entire cities that mimicked only the outward-facing aspects of human culture.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Agricultural knowledge, building engineering, and many academic disciplines...</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> They mimicked them in form, but completely ignored the actual underlying contents.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> They&#39;re just surface-level copies, look-alikes. Magical energy takes care of the rest.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> The best example is that cathedral. The fairies have no gods, and no concept of religion.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> They didn&#39;t have any reason to build that cathedral. But they built it because it was fun.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> That&#39;s the culture of this fairyland, and the way they treat humans.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Umm, in other words...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> They&#39;re ripping off human culture?</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Hm...well, I guess that&#39;s one way to put it.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Even if my situation is different, I&#39;m still a fairy as well.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> In a world with few humans, I can understand why they ended up this way.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Both in pan-human history and in this Lostbelt, humans are something that fairies toy with to kill time.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> The society that has achieved ultimate control over humans is this Fairy Kingdom,</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> and it was under the policy of your enemy, Queen Morgan.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Huh? Fujimaru and the others are going up against Morgan?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Yeah. That&#39;s the plan for now, right, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m still trying to figure out what is going on...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> We need to meet the King of this Lostbelt...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> But first, we need to find Mash and da Vinci...</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Oops, that&#39;s right. We&#39;re getting our priorities muddled.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Let&#39;s head to a tavern for now. Where people gather, there&#39;s always a chance of hearing some good information.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Artoria?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You&#39;ve frozen in place, what&#39;s the matter?</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> You see...Fujimaru saved my life, and while I&#39;m certainly indebted to you...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> (I don&#39;t know what to do...if they&#39;re going to be fighting Her Majesty Morgan, my presence would certainly be a nuisance...)</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> (I thought I would stick around until we found Mash, but maybe it&#39;s right to part ways here...)</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> O-ho.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> —Ahem. By the way, Artoria.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Do you know what happens when a human is found without their master in this city?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> They&#39;re treated as a fugitive who escaped from a farm, and sent to New Darlington.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> New Darlington...w-wait, the “National Slaughter Theatre” Darlington?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> National Slaughter...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Theatre...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Come again?</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> W-well, that doesn&#39;t sound very nice...this is the city of freedom, Salisbury, remember?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> In a city ruled by the head of the Wind Clan, such horrible treatment is simply impossible...</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Nope. Even though she&#39;s the head of the Wind Clan, she can&#39;t go against the Queen&#39;s decree.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> More importantly, as head, it&#39;s important to have as many reliable collaborators and sympathizers as possible.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Fujimaru is a lost child who doesn&#39;t know left from right, and more importantly, is also human.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Without a “master” being present, we&#39;ll end up with a repeat of what happened in the “Nameless Forest”.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I&#39;m a prince, as you can see, so...</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Having a [♂ boy /♀ girl] of unknown origin as my squire, something like that isn&#39;t going to convince many.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> You&#39;re a much better match for Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Oh, I&#39;m not saying you should be together forever. Just as long as we&#39;re in Salisbury.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> More than anything...it&#39;s more convenient for you too, right? It&#39;s better than being alone, you know?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I guess that&#39;s true...with Britain as it is now, you&#39;d be questioned if you&#39;re alone, wouldn&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> But, why not just have Tristan pretend to be Fujimaru&#39;s Master?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> It&#39;s not impossible, but Tristan doesn&#39;t know much about the Fairy Kingdom.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> If he were interrogated by the clan&#39;s guards, they&#39;d be able to call his bluff immediately. If I were you, I wouldn&#39;t risk it.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> B-but, but only high-class fairies can take humans as servants, and...if I&#39;m one of those...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> If I become Fujimaru&#39;s master—</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> It&#39;s just for appearances&#39; sake. Would you prefer [♂ him /♀ her] to be your pet?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> T-t-t-t-that&#39;s disrespectful! I-I-I-I-I&#39;m not ready for something like that!</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Great, then it&#39;s decided.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Fujimaru. Artoria will be your master for a little while.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> We&#39;re doing this so that we can travel through Britain safely. Can you play the part?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Nice to meet you, too.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It&#39;s not my first time acting.</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> ...(sigh). If it&#39;s alright with you, it&#39;s alright with me.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> We&#39;ve made it this far together, so let&#39;s work together a little longer, everyone.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Yes, this is something to be positive about. I guess, it&#39;s one of my old dreams come true!</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> ...? Excuse me, Caster. What would you say that dream was?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> It&#39;s a dream of every fairy who grew up in the countryside. To be one of the upper echelon fairies in a big city, you know?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> —</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Well, well, well, good day to you, the fine folk of Salisbury! Are we all having a good time?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Fairy King of the Autumn Forest, preacher of flowers, peace, and fairy tales, the boisterous Oberon, sorry to intrude!</p><p><strong>I：Fairy (Tavern Keeper):</strong> Yo, Oberon, glad to see you&#39;re doing well! You&#39;re in Salisbury again!</p><p><strong>I：Fairy (Tavern Keeper):</strong> Maybe today&#39;s the day you&#39;ve come to pick up your tab!</p><p><strong>N：Fairy holding a Wooden Cup:</strong> Oh, to see Oberon&#39;s face makes it all worthwhile to be drinking in the middle of the day!</p><p><strong>N：Fairy holding a Wooden Cup:</strong> Have you come to repay what I loaned you last time?</p><p><strong>D：Garden-loving Fairy:</strong> Oberon! Thanks to you, the trees in my backyard are much more docile!</p><p><strong>D：Garden-loving Fairy:</strong> But, you&#39;ve gotta give me my money back!</p><p><strong>E：Fairy in a Dress:</strong> The wonderful Oberon, do you have any time? I hope you&#39;ll come to our tea party today!</p><p><strong>E：Fairy in a Dress:</strong> And, you&#39;ve gotta give me my money back!</p><p><strong>F：A Fairy with a Mighty Physique:</strong> I&#39;ve been waiting for you, you poor penniless prince! Come here, I&#39;ll buy you a drink!</p><p><strong>F：A Fairy with a Mighty Physique:</strong> But first, you&#39;ve gotta give me my money back!</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Hahahahaha.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Stop it, gentlemen! Don&#39;t make me out to be the most popular man on the planet!</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I&#39;m with a very dear friend today, so keep quiet about the money!</p><p><strong>Fairies:</strong> Hahahahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Fairies:</strong> We know, we know. We&#39;re just having a laugh!</p><p><strong>Fairies:</strong> You&#39;ve given us so much more, who cares about the Queen&#39;s coin! Let us buy you a drink!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Money...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Penniless prince...?</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Are you broke, by any chance? Even though you call yourself a king?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Well, my financial situation is in a bit of a pickle. Being broke, you could say that, yes.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> But it can&#39;t be helped, you know? When I was summoned to this Fairy Kingdom, all I had was this cloak.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> When I woke up, I was literally naked in the middle of a forest, on top of a pile of dead leaves.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Normally, I&#39;d stay there, waiting for someone from pan-human history to come and help, but...</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> You&#39;ve gotta do what you gotta do when you&#39;re the one who was summoned first.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Fairies are creatures who flutter around “interesting” things. That&#39;s why I&#39;ve been visiting various cities.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I&#39;ve sang songs, made everyone merry, told fairy tales, made the evenings lively, and even entertained the ladies.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Through my diligent activities, I&#39;ve made a name for myself in Britain as “The Fairy King that rules somewhere nobody knows. ”</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Well, it&#39;s only a reputation that extends to the major cities.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Ah...so the reason I didn&#39;t know you, Oberon, was because my village was in the countryside...</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I&#39;m sorry about that. Henceforth, I&#39;ll ponder about an expedition to the countryside.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> But, after all, this was just one battle.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Do you have any idea how it felt, to act all “high and mighty” all the time, while being completely broke?</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Indeed...I often masqueraded as someone I was not, and sang of my love of beautiful ladies in bars...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> No, it must have been difficult...I understand the exhilaration, no, the tension you must have felt...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Oberon. As a fellow poet, I have the utmost respect for your efforts.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> If you could tell me, in detail, about your successful exploits in this Fairy Kingdom later on...</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> If you&#39;re up for it, it would be my pleasure. With your performance, we&#39;ll attract even more and more patrons.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I see, I see! Tristan and Oberon are kindred spirits. Both enemies of women!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> So, Oberon. Where is a good place for us to sit?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> At the back of the tavern, there&#39;s a raised area with a circular table that I prefer.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> It&#39;s hard for the other customers to see you, and you&#39;ll get a full view of the place.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Let&#39;s start with a toast. We&#39;ll order some fruit juice. Hey there cutie, are you the new waiter?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Tell the owner I&#39;ll take the back table. And four fruit juices, please.</p><p><strong>K：Waitress:</strong> Yes, thank you for your order~! We&#39;ll have it ready soon, so please take your time and enjoy yourself~!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> —Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>K：Waitress:</strong> —Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Da Vinci-chan!?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> No way, really!? Yay, it&#39;s Fujimaru—!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Jeez, just listen to me already!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> After we were separated by the fog, I followed a hunch, and walked back to the beach!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Luckily, after heading east along the coast, away from that fog-shrouded forest,</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I found Salisbury. I figured that since there were more people, I could gather information.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> And then...</p><p><strong>Fairy Tavernkeep:</strong> A heavenly angel descended into my store.</p><p><strong>Fairy Tavernkeep:</strong> She had an unsteady gait, yet with an unshakable will hiding in her blue eyes, she said:</p><p><strong>Fairy Tavernkeep:</strong> “What a wonderful shop. Please let me work here until the day I die. ”</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I didn&#39;t say that!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I told you, I was looking for a human, and simply asked for a glass of water first!</p><p><strong>Fairy Tavernkeep:</strong> Tch. Well, you&#39;re always welcome to become my housewife! If you change your mind anytime, just let me know!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yeah, yeah. Get back to the counter, Mike. I&#39;ll show you how to make a cocktail later.</p><p><strong>Fairy Tavernkeep:</strong> Hehe. Hehehe. Ah, Dabinchi...my angel...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Anyway, that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been up to.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I&#39;m glad you&#39;re safe, Fujimaru, Tristan.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> As for Mash...it doesn&#39;t seem like we&#39;ve been able to meet up with her yet.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I see, the other Servant that Fujimaru mentioned,</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> that&#39;s you, isn&#39;t it? I&#39;m honored to meet the renaissance genius Leonardo da Vinci.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> And you? You know my name, so are you a Servant from pan-human history?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I&#39;m Oberon. King of Fairies, Oberon. Well, over here, “King of Fairies” is just a job title.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Nice to meet you, da Vinci.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I&#39;m Artoria Caster. I met Fujimaru in the forest.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Now...well, there&#39;s a lot going on, and as Fujimaru&#39;s owner,</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> it&#39;s a relief to have finally met you...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Well, isn&#39;t this interesting!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That&#39;s a relief, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Thanks, Artoria. But you&#39;re a fairy from this Britain, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard our situation to some degree, but...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Furthermore, you&#39;re lending a hand to Fujimaru, right?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Y-yes, well...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> To tell the truth, I don&#39;t really understand half the things Oberon and Fujimaru say...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> But I can tell Fujimaru isn&#39;t lying.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I can&#39;t bring myself to ignore people in need, and to be honest, it&#39;s a little fun.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I see. Then it&#39;s alright to talk here.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> So, Fujimaru, can you tell us what you&#39;ve been up to so far?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I see...so that&#39;s what happened in the woods. In any case, I&#39;m glad you two are alright.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Thanks for guarding [♂ him /♀ her], Tristan. You too, Oberon and Artoria.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> “We still don&#39;t know much about Britain. ” “We don&#39;t know where Mash is. ”</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> “But we&#39;re sure Mash is okay. ” “Oberon is completely broke. ”</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Right. If all that is clear, we can take proper measures from now on.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Oberon&#39;s judgement was correct.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> What we should do now is not move around Britain aimlessly.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Gather information using Salisbury as a base, and solve our problems one by one.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Our first priority is “finding Mash. ” I&#39;ll gather information about “a girl wearing iron armor”...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> And in the process we&#39;ll be able to learn about the state of Britain and the situation of the fairies living in it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Based here?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Da Vinci, are you staying somewhere?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yeah, of course I am. This tavern doubles as an inn.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Well, to be precise, it&#39;s a building that closely resembles “an inn built by humans. ”</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Mike didn&#39;t know what an “inn” was. I had to show him how to make use of the spare rooms.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> In return, I was allowed to use the three rooms on the second floor☆</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Meaning, I&#39;ve set up Chaldea&#39;s forward base. I believe I&#39;ll be able to join you at some point.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Oho...I would expect nothing less of da Vinci...the girl Sir Lancelot would fall for with a single glance...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Hm? Your side&#39;s Lancelot, are they a young lady like da Vinci?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Pfffft! (spit take)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You could say something like that!</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Mm, that&#39;s great. Da Vinci seems to be a truly reliable Servant.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Well, I&#39;ll guess I&#39;ll leave this area to you. As a matter of fact, I have a huge amount of stuff I need to work on.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Oberon...? Are you saying you&#39;re leaving us?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Yeah. I&#39;ll try and get some information on this Mash girl too.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> You need some information on Britain in general, as well.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Britain is definitely going to undergo some changes, thanks to the arrival of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> You don&#39;t have many allies here. And you need to know what&#39;s going on in every region.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> We&#39;ll meet again soon, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Of course. If I come here, I can see you all.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I&#39;ll bring some good news with me next time. Until then, you all need to get used to Britain.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Oh, he&#39;s already gone.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> He&#39;s dependable, but he really marches to the beat of his own drum, doesn&#39;t he?</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Yes...such a glamorous outfit...I understand...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> I am overjoyed...we are kindred poets, without a doubt...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Um...so what are we going to do now? I can show you around Salisbury.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> No, everyone needs to rest today. You walked all the way here, didn&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Come on, upstairs, upstairs.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Fujimaru takes one room, while Tristan and I take the second.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> And Artoria can have the one I prepared for Mash.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Good thing I was greedy enough to get three. The rooms are also secured with magic barriers.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> They&#39;re completely soundproof. You&#39;re in safe hands.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (Da Vinci is winking at me...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (I see, we&#39;ll continue this in my room...)</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Ah! Um, is it alright if I have it to myself (and free of charge)?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Yay, I&#39;ve always wanted my own room! Gonna go rest, gonna go rest, gonna go rest!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Thank you, da Vinci!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Wooow, such generous fairies! Pan-human History is amazing!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> She&#39;s gone...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I didn&#39;t mention it out of consideration for her, but she&#39;s different from the “Artoria” we know.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Yes. Pan-human history&#39;s King of Britain...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> King Arthur...it seems like she should be considered a completely different person from Artoria Pendragon...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Mm. Let&#39;s bear that in mind and change our discussion. Can you two head upstairs?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Something might happen here. We have to keep our discussion of pan-human history between ourselves.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Right, I&#39;ll begin with what I know. First, concerning this Fairy Kingdom of Britain.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Now that you&#39;ve been to Salisbury, you&#39;ve seen the state of the island yourselves, but...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> This Lostbelt is different from the previous ones, to a great degree.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I really don&#39;t think it&#39;s “human history that diverged at a specific branch point. ”</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> As you can see, humankind doesn&#39;t reign as the dominant species. Fundamentally, it&#39;s a world of nothing but fairies.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Russia was a world where humanity was unable to survive due to a massive ice age, and was forced to evolve accordingly.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Scandinavia was a world where the Age of Gods concluded in Ragnarok, and humanity declined alongside the gods.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> China was ruled by the one true man and became a one-nation world in perpetuity.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> India was a world that attempted to converge with perfection by endlessly repeating the “saṃsāra of the world” rather than “saṃsāra of humans. ”</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Greece was a world where humanity was under the complete control of gods who never perished.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Each had ceased to develop any further, but they were still fundamentally worlds of mankind.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> No matter how far they deviated from us, they were building an anthroposphere that ran parallel to the global environment of 2017.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But this Britain is different. It&#39;s not a “world of mankind” to begin with.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Becuase, as you can see, there is nothing “outside of Britain. ”</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It&#39;s not like up to now, where the view of the outside world was blocked by a wall of storms.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> There&#39;s really nothing beyond the island here. The five continents and all other nations don&#39;t exist.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> So long as we&#39;re in this Lostbelt, the only things on Earth are Great Britain and the ocean.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Meaning—</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> An &quot;alternate world&quot; unrelated to human history?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yup. Right now, that&#39;s what I&#39;d have to say.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I&#39;ve spent the last few days asking around about the situations with other countries, but nobody knows what a “foreign country” even is.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The Fairy Kingdom of Britain has some kind of bizarre secret forming the basis of its creation.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Uncovering it is the key to conquering this Lostbelt...no, it&#39;ll probably tie everything together.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Hold on. If no other European countries exist, then...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Will the fairies in this land be ones solely unique to Britain?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Good question, Tristan.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> If there are no other regions, there&#39;s no reason for folklore from specific regions to be introduced to Britain...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But, that&#39;s the convergence of human history, right?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> If a fairy originally came from Earth, then it still came to be even if their form and particulars differ.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> In this Fairy Kingdom, fairies found in European folklore have arisen in different forms.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I guess you could call it a similar ecosystem.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> If the environment is Earth, the civilizations, events, and the life that appears can be similar.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> A similarity rises...you say?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yes. The Fairy Kingdom of Britain is completely different from the Britain we know.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But, even in such a different world, there are many overlaps.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Such as the names of cities or fairies.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Or the name of the Queen who rules this world.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Did you see that huge castle to the north on the way here? That&#39;s the castle of Queen Morgan, the ruler of these lands.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The castle&#39;s name is Camelot.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> In pan-human history, the castle became the setting for “King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table,” and Britain&#39;s symbol of peace.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> And it was Morgan who was credited with defeating King Arthur and indirectly bringing Britain to ruin.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> She is the most powerful, most evil witch in Britain.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;ve heard of her before we came here, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Morgan, the witch</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yeah. As far as my investigations can tell, Morgan has dominated this land for close to 2,000 years.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> A long time ago, there used to be six lords in Britain. Nowadays they&#39;re called “clans. ”</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Wind, Earth, Fang, Mirror, Wing, and one other. For thousands of years, they&#39;ve continuously rivaled each other.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Using black magic, Morgan defeated them, and unified Britain with half the clans by force.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Afterwards, Morgan granted the humans a certain degree of freedom,</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> and, apparently it took 2,000 years to create this copycat civilization.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Morgan...to do such things, even in a Lostbelt...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> No. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not the same Morgan we know, but...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> So, how is her rule? She went as far as to name her castle Camelot.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Does she rule as justly and unashamedly as King Arthur?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It&#39;s absolutely awful!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Morgan dominates the fairies and imposes strict control over the number of human births.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The fairies living in the cities are obligated to be inscribed with Morgan&#39;s curse—a Command Spell.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Once a year, the fairies tattooed with this Command Spell are forced to “offer” their life force.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It&#39;s called the “existence tax” in the Fairy Kingdom. It&#39;s basically their magical energy and vitality.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The fairies who fail to amass enough magical energy to satisfy Morgan over the course of a year, well, they just die on the spot.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It seems that when Morgan took the throne, she said to the fairies:</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> “I will not pardon you. I will not save you. ”</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> “Merely obey. Hang your heads. I will protect Britain through absolute subservience. ”</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Fairies who can&#39;t stand for this or who can&#39;t work are taken to Camelot for disposal.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Either that or they flee the cities, to escape to a place where nobody knows them, so it seems.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> An annual existence tax...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I see, so...</p><hr><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> An oppressive regime will give rise to forces of opposition...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> In spite of this, this Britain has remained under Morgan&#39;s control for 2,000 years?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I guess that shows just how powerful Morgan is.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You see, she collects half the life force of fairies living in Britain every year.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> None of the fairies can stand against her. Be that as it may, Morgan&#39;s rule isn&#39;t all bad.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Look, that weird black thing you fought on the beach? The fairies call it “Mors,” but...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> They say it&#39;s the first in a series of Calamities plaguing Great Britain since the island&#39;s creation.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> A fairy that has lost their purpose. A fairy that has lost their radiance.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Among fairies like these, there are a few that become Mors.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> From the fairies&#39; point of view, the Mors are their natural enemy.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> All it takes is a touch for the Mors to spread, then that fairy will become a Mors as well.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It&#39;s like a disease only fairies can contract.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Mors were the first, but many other Calamities spring up periodically in Britain.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Morgan...the Queen&#39;s military are constantly driving these calamities back.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Morgan is a cold-hearted tyrant, while at the same time being the sword that protects Britain.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The fairies fear and despise her, but at the same time they rely on her rule...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> And that sums up the current state of the Fairy Kingdom.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So, as expected, Morgan is the Lostbelt King?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yeah. There&#39;s no mistaking it. Our objective, Rhongomyniad...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That great magic that reached Olympus. Morgan is the only one who could have unleashed it.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Of course, that would mean that Beryl Gut is involved with Morgan,</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> and we&#39;re not going to get as much as the time of day to peacefully negotiate with her!</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> I understand. So we must overthrow Morgan for our own reasons.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Aah! But it&#39;s said to be impossible to enter Camelot without the Queen&#39;s permission!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Nevertheless, Morgan&#39;s rule is not absolute. Right now, a new hope has been born in Britain.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> We arrived at the turning point for the Fairy Kingdom of Britain...the best opportunity has turned up.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What new hope?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The “Child of Prophecy. ”</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Before they disappeared, the chief of the now-extinct Mirror Clan devised a prophecy.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> In a nutshell, it&#39;s this:</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> “Sixteen years from now, a savior will appear. Guided by the Staff of Selection, the true king will be crowned. ”</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> “When the six bells toll, the false queen will be overthrown. With fairies and humans together, the false history will end. ”</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Well? Have you heard this somewhere?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It&#39;s quite credible. After all, the Mirror Clan&#39;s predictions are never off the mark.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The Queen&#39;s been rounding up and imprisoning all the fairies that turn 16 this year, but...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The hunt for the Child of Prophecy continues. It&#39;s proof they haven&#39;t found them yet.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Between the Mors and the Child, the Queen&#39;s rule is looking pretty shaky right now.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> If we make good use of this, it might not be impossible to negotiate with Morgan.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Be that as it may, our first priority now is finding Mash. First you need to rest and recover your strength.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Starting tomorrow we&#39;ll gather some information. Naturally, let&#39;s try to be as inconspicuous as possible.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Been a long time since I&#39;ve had a soft bed...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> The British Lostbelt...Queen Morgan...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Artoria...Oberon...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Mash...please stay safe—</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Well, let&#39;s get some rest as well, shall we?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Sleep isn&#39;t necessary for Servants, but it&#39;s exhausting to constantly be on alert, right?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You never took your fingers off your bowstrings even once. As expected of a Knight of the Round Table, eh Tristan?</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Hm...I must need rest as well, to have been seen through like that...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> But there will be other opportunities.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> It is you who must rest, da Vinci. You may be a Servant as well, but,</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> you are a living organism right now, the same as Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Please rest, and do not overwork yourself. My duty is to watch over you both.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Is that so? As you wish, then. As expected of the most beautiful man of the Round Table, Tristan the Lamenting.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Thank you. I&#39;ll take you up on your offer. To be honest, I&#39;m exhausted.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Please do. However, before that...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> I have a favor to ask. It will take but a moment before you fall asleep...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> The records of the Sixth Singularity.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> The deeds done by the “me” who was summoned in the Holy City of Camelot—</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Could you please tell me what those were?</p><h2 id="section-3-aurora" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3-aurora" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 3: Aurora</h2><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Good morning, everybody! Ah, the bed was sooooooo comfortable!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Good, good, changing the bedding was worth the time. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re happy with it.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> These fairy beds just imitate the shape of one, so the cushions are usually hard as a ro~ck.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Tristan, at your service. If you so desire, I can play a waking tune, or something similar...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Morning, everyone.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Let&#39;s hit the streets and gather some intel!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Woah, someone&#39;s raring to go. However, you should dial it back a little bit.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> There may not be many of the Queen&#39;s soldiers in Salisbury, but there are quite a few of her sympathizers.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Just act natural, alright?</p><hr><p><strong>Fairy Tavernkeep:</strong> Dabinchi, are you going out?! You&#39;re not going to wait tables with your pretty skates!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Sorry, just a bit of sightseeing~! I&#39;ll help out this afternoon!</p><p><strong>Fairy Tavernkeep:</strong> O-oh...that&#39;s right, that was the promise.</p><p><strong>Fairy Tavernkeep:</strong> You guys! I don&#39;t know what clan you&#39;re from, but don&#39;t work Dabinchi too hard!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Oh?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hm? What is it, Fujimaru? Something on your mind?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> No, the sky...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It&#39;s the same as yesterday...</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Oh, that. I was surprised at first, too.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The weather here doesn&#39;t change. There&#39;s just this sky, and the night.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It seems to rain too. There&#39;s nothing in this world that clears the air and shows the blue sky.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Huh? Blue sky—does the sky really turn blue in your Britain!?</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Yes. A beautiful, clear sky, completely unblemished. Of course, the sky of this land is beautiful also.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Huh...blue, the color of bluebell flowers, right? I can&#39;t believe it turns that color...wow...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> It must be a very bright and colourful world.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I bet no matter how hard life is, everyone helps each other with a smile.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Anyway, shall we start gathering information?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I&#39;m Fujimaru&#39;s master, right?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Alright, let&#39;s get into gear. Where should we head first?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> They won&#39;t let you in a Woodwose-branded store without a squire, right?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Oh, it doesn&#39;t matter. As long as we look like a gathering of fairies.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Well then, let&#39;s observe the current state of affairs while pretending to be out for a walk.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> We&#39;ll listen in on gossip, and occasionally join in on some of it.</p><p><strong>Fang Fairy:</strong> Do I know any fairies in iron armor, you say? What, are you all interested in the Queen&#39;s army?</p><p><strong>Fang Fairy:</strong> Whoa, stop right there. There&#39;s no good to be had joining the Queen&#39;s army now!</p><p><strong>Fang Fairy:</strong> After all, this is the year that Ainsel predicted, the year of salvation, the year when the Child of Prophecy would appear!</p><p><strong>Fang Fairy:</strong> Maybe if they give the Queen a hard time, she&#39;ll lower her taxes a little!</p><p><strong>Fang Fairy:</strong> Eh, that&#39;s not it? You got separated? Ah, I see. I have no clue.</p><p><strong>Earth Fairy:</strong> Metal armor? You won&#39;t find that here. If it&#39;s iron you&#39;re after, you should head to Norwich.</p><p><strong>Earth Fairy:</strong> Unless Spriggan closed the mine, they should still be making those silly weapons.</p><p><strong>Earth Fairy:</strong> What kind of weapons? Well naturally, they&#39;re swords and spears, axes and bows.</p><p><strong>Earth Fairy:</strong> Jeez, what&#39;s it come to these days, fairies using iron weapons...</p><p><strong>Earth Fairy:</strong> What the heck is the Queen doing...?</p><p><strong>Earth Fairy:</strong> But it&#39;s only for a little bit longer, right? The Child of Prophecy will take care of it all somehow.</p><p><strong>Wind Fairy:</strong> Hey, have you guys heard? There&#39;s some kind of disaster brewing in Norwich.</p><p><strong>Wind Fairy:</strong> The sky above Norwich is pitch-black and gloomy, even during the day.</p><p><strong>Wind Fairy:</strong> With the big “Calamity Pool” rearing its ugly head, Norwich is done for.</p><p><strong>Wind Fairy:</strong> A noisy city of iron and soot. A hangout for dirty humans. Norwich deserves to just disappear...</p><p><strong>Wind Fairy:</strong> Ahh, how worrisome.</p><p><strong>Wind Fairy:</strong> Maybe the fairies escaping Norwich will come to our city.</p><p><strong>Wind Fairy:</strong> I don&#39;t want any more from the Earth Clan in historic Salisbury...</p><p><strong>Wind Fairy:</strong> But Lady Aurora is too kind...she&#39;ll probably just accept them...</p><p><strong>Fairy In the Form of a Bird:</strong> You&#39;re looking for someone? You mean in Salisbury? Or in all of Britain?</p><p><strong>Fairy In the Form of a Bird:</strong> Hahaha. If it&#39;s all of Britain, that&#39;s a lot to ask of the fairies here.</p><p><strong>Fairy In the Form of a Bird:</strong> Salisbury is too comfortable, so people don&#39;t want to go outside.</p><p><strong>Fairy In the Form of a Bird:</strong> If you want to know about other cities, you have to get out there. Oh, but you guys don&#39;t have wings.</p><p><strong>Fairy In the Form of a Bird:</strong> You won&#39;t get far that way, the Mors will get you!</p><p><strong>Fairy In the Form of a Bird:</strong> More importantly, I wonder what tonight&#39;s festival will be? Maybe they&#39;ll put on another production of “The Wicked Witch and the Child of Prophecy”!</p><p><strong>Fairy In the Form of a Bird:</strong> I love that one! It&#39;s great when the Queen and her damn knights get beaten up!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> ...(exhausted)</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...(sick of this)</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> ...(depressed)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> How disappointing...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> We barely got anything...</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Well, I never thought we&#39;d find any leads in a single day.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Everybody&#39;s talking about the Child of Prophecy and nothing else, so they&#39;re not listening to us seriously.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Yes...in the end, we were even asked to buy Child of Prophecy merchandise...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> It is a fever, everywhere we go. As if it were Christmas.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> The Child of Prophecy boom...it reeks of great profit...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I guess that&#39;s what everyone is hoping for.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> The Child of Prophecy...just who could they be...</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Uhm...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yeah. Everyone&#39;s obsessed with the Child of Prophecy, and the only other gossip is whatever&#39;s going on in Norwich to the east.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> All this talk has gotten me curious. What kind of fairy is the Child of Prophecy?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> If the prophecy is right, they want to fight Morgan. So if we play our cards right, we might be able to cooperate.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Well? Should we try looking for them while we search for Mash?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The fairies sure have high expectations. They must be someone really strong and gallant!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>C：Voices from the Entrance:</strong> Everyone, I&#39;m back to bother you one day later! Oh wow...there&#39;s not very many customers today.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Oberon!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Over here!</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Hey. I spent the morning walking the streets, is it really already lunchtime? Anyway—</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> That seems like it&#39;d be fun. If that&#39;s the plan, let me join in too.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Since I&#39;m bad at fighting, my specialty is buttering people up. I&#39;m a peacemaker.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> That&#39;s it! So much that, I&#39;ll show you how to get on Artoria&#39;s good side.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What do you mean?</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Oh, you haven&#39;t told them yet, Artoria?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> You see, she&#39;s your Child of Prophecy.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I thought that would be pretty obvious, since you know, she has the same name as King Arthur.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Well, I thought that might be the case given the name Artoria, but...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Is that for real, Artoria!? Because, well—</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> To put it mildly, your magical energy is below average for fairies, isn&#39;t it!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Your Magic Circuits, or would they be Divine Patterns since you&#39;re a fairy? Anyway, they&#39;re better than a human&#39;s but worse than a fairy&#39;s.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Even Mike&#39;s are stronger! And despite this, you&#39;re the Child supposed to defeat the Queen!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (That&#39;s right...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (I kinda know how that feels...)</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Y-y-yes, you&#39;re absolutely right!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m sorry! I have the Staff of Selection, so I&#39;m sorry!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> B-b-but it&#39;s not like that makes me the Child of Prophecy...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I don&#39;t have the determination, drive, or character to fight the Queen in the first place, and...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I&#39;m not a clan fairy...and because I don&#39;t have much magical energy, I have no choice but to somehow fake it with magecraft...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> They told me to ring the bell, but I can&#39;t even get near it...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> But I&#39;m doing my best, I feel...I feel...yes...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> But the reality is, it&#39;s really hard to do...haha...why did it have to be me?</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You don&#39;t think you can, Artoria?</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I don&#39;t know...it&#39;s just...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> If I really am the Child of Prophecy, I have a way to fight, or so I think.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I was born and raised to do this.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> —That&#39;s what I try and tell myself, but I&#39;m too useless for anything like that...!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> The last time I came to Salisbury, I tried to speak to the head of the Wind Clan,</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> but nobody listened to me, so I headed to Manchester next...!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I see...so that&#39;s why you didn&#39;t say anything...Fairies can tell the amount and strength of someone&#39;s magical energy with a single glance...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> If Artoria said she was the Child of Prophecy, they&#39;d just laugh in her face...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> They&#39;d yell at her to stop lying...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> They&#39;d scold her for screwing around...</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Yes. That&#39;s why I thought I would ask a clan head for approval first...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> But I was turned away at the door...</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Hmm. The head of the Wind Clan is Aurora, right?</p><p><strong>--SECTION BREAK--</strong></p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I much prefer the current Artoria. But if you&#39;d rather act like a big shot instead, then so be it.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> If that&#39;s the entire scope of the problem, let&#39;s resolve it with haste.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Hm? Are you implying that you have a solution, Oberon?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> That&#39;s what I said. I can get you an audience with Aurora.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> See, wasn&#39;t it easy to get in? This is the bell tower at the heart of Salisbury.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> The oldest building in the Fairy Kingdom, the Cathedral of Tonelico!</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Let&#39;s head on upstairs, boys and girls. Aurora&#39;s room is on the top floor.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I&#39;ve already delivered the news, so the guards shouldn&#39;t—whoa, there.</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong> Welcome, King of the Autumn Woods. Your visit is unexpected, but since it is you, you are welcome to come in.</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong> However, this is a sacred place for the coronation of new rulers.</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong> The place where Her Majesty Queen Morgan was crowned 2,000 years ago.</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong> To allow in a lower being such as a human, even if they are a squire—</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong> No matter how favored you are by Lady Aurora, such a thing cannot be permitted.</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong> Guards, this way. Seize the fairies of unknown affiliation, and the disgusting human.</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong> If they surrender peacefully, wonderful. If the human tries to escape, it does not matter if you dispose of them.</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong> Needless to say, the same goes for Oberon. There is no need to treat him any differently.</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong> We&#39;ve received letters of protest from shops all over the city, saying “he needs to pay his bill, as soon as possible. ”</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Eh? Well, this is heading in a different direction than I planned for...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> OBERON!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (Does he actually hate us? )</p><hr><p><strong>F：Sentinel:</strong> If that is your order, I shall obey, but...are you sure, Mistress Coral?</p><p><strong>F：Sentinel:</strong> Lady Aurora seemed quite happy, and said to let him through immediately, but...</p><p><strong>E：Coral:</strong> I do not suffer opinions. Even if you were chosen to be sentinels, you are all mere humans.</p><p><strong>E：Coral:</strong> Know your place. Or do you want to be turned into a rabbit right here?</p><p><strong>F：Sentinel:</strong> As you say. I&#39;m extremely sorry, Lord Oberon.</p><p><strong>F：Sentinel:</strong> This is also my duty...please excuse any violence.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> The number of opponents does not appear to be a serious threat, but it seems we cannot avoid combat.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Let&#39;s go, Fujimaru. Show them our might.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> How&#39;s that, Coral!? This is our true power!</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Underestimate the penniless prince and this human at your own peril!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> (Oberon was just cheering us on in the back, though. )</p><p><strong>Coral:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Coral:</strong> I see. It certainly seems that this human is no small fry.</p><p><strong>Coral:</strong> Lady Aurora loves unusual things. It is what gives Lady Aurora her power.</p><p><strong>Coral:</strong> I shall grant you a special audience with her. However, do not get carried away.</p><p><strong>Coral:</strong> “Something unusual” remains so only the first time you encounter it. Once you have become accustomed to it, the value that lies within is lost.</p><p><strong>Coral:</strong> Such audiences are granted rarely. Do not waste this good fortune.</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> Hello, Oberon. What story have you brought me today?</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> You&#39;re very well-informed, so I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a wonderful tale.</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> I greatly look forward to it. It has been nothing but gloom recently...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (So...beautiful...! )</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> This radiance is too much to look at...</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Mm. There&#39;s one tale someone in your position can&#39;t ignore, and one favor I have to ask.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Two things in total, but they won&#39;t take much time. But first, can I be selfish for a moment?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I&#39;d like this to be a secret between you and me. You don&#39;t mind, do you?</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> My, how brazen. I am weak to scary stories...fufu.</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> A little thrill might be fun. —Coral. Would you excuse us for a moment?</p><p><strong>Coral:</strong> Lady Aurora!</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> Worry not, these people can be trusted. And that trust should be mutual, no?</p><p><strong>Coral:</strong> Of course...Should you change your mind, please call for me right away.</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> Please forgive Coral. She is a proud girl, but rather rigid.</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> I&#39;m sure she gave you another stern welcome, did she not? I am glad you escaped injury.</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> Greetings, guests of Oberon. I am Aurora, leader of the Wind Clan.</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> I am the Lord of Salisbury. —What would you ask of me today?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> (Oooh...the atmosphere changed in a heartbeat. Her leadership stems from more than just her pretty face, I guess? )</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Actually...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> We&#39;re having trouble finding someone.</p><hr><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> —Oh my. Oh my, oh my, oh my!</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> It has been so many years since a human has spoken to me so freely!</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> What is your name, my dear? Could you be a free citizen? What is your pedigree—ah.</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> My apologies, [♂ he /♀ she] is your squire. How impolite of me.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Aurora. You really ought to work on your bad habit of rushing to protect every weak human you see.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Keep that up, and eventually you&#39;ll have every human in Britain living in Salisbury.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> The faction of the Wind Clan that&#39;s for coexistence is really only you, isn&#39;t it? Aren&#39;t you under some heavy criticism for that?</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> You are right, but...</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> I...I just couldn&#39;t deny [♂ his /♀ her] puppy-dog eyes...you know?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Good grief. Well, that&#39;s the reason I brought [♂ him /♀ her] here in the first place.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I told you before about the world of pan-human history, and the group calling themselves Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> [♂ He /♀ She]&#39;s a Master from Chaldea. The two back there aren&#39;t fairies, but Servants.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> —Oberon.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> It&#39;s alright, she may be from the Fairy Kingdom, but her thoughts are more along the lines of us pan-human history fairies.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> She&#39;d never say it herself, but she wants to change the way things are in the Kingdom.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Isn&#39;t that right, Aurora? It&#39;s been 2,000 years since Britain fell under Morgan&#39;s rule.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> You&#39;ve seen a lot happen since then, in all shapes and sizes.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> You think Morgan&#39;s rule should end.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I saw the hope in your eyes when I told you about the outside world before.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Fujimaru came here to defeat Morgan.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> [♂ He /♀ She] doesn&#39;t care about what comes afterwards. [♂ He /♀ She] isn&#39;t interested in ruling in place of Morgan.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> And after [♂ he /♀ she] leaves, whether or not Britain falls into ruin will be up to its people.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Chaldea won&#39;t care about your efforts to save a collapsing Britain.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> They won&#39;t stand in your way. From the beginning, their only objective has been Morgan.</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> So it seems...</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> The young lady behind you has a grave look upon her face, but that [♂ child /♀ girl] does not deny your words.</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> Travellers from a world different than ours...a properly advanced Britain...</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> Something so unbelievable, so suddenly, but...</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> This may also be Ainsel&#39;s guidance. Yes. Those in trouble should help each other.</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> Fujimaru, was it?</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> Even though you may be hostile to this land, I shall allow your conduct in Salisbury.</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> If you are searching for someone, I shall allow you to use the eyes of the Wind Clan in the other cities.</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> Oxford, Gloucester, New Darlington, and Camelot.</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> Norwich is the only place I cannot contact my clan, but we shall help search for your friend.</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> Please tell Coral what this person looks like once we are done here. I do hope we may be of assistance.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Thank you so much...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> But, is this really alright...?</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> You ask if I am truly willing to help you?</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> Hehe. You are so honest, and yet so kind, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> It is true that for those who call this land home, cooperating with you may not be in their best interests.</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> However, I think our...current state of being is more important than the survival of our kingdom.</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> Her Majesty is a very capable ruler, however...</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> If we leave things the way they are, there will be grave consequences...</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Be that as it may, our cooperation must be kept a secret for the time being.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> If it became known that Lady Aurora was working with Chaldea, Morgan would likely massacre the entire Wind Clan.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Therefore, we shall keep this under wraps. And if push comes to shove, we can just deny all knowledge of each other.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Kill them all...even the leader of the Wind Clan can&#39;t defeat Queen Morgan face-to-face?</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> No, I cannot. We all live and die at the mercy of the Queen.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I-I see...Queen Morgan is amazing...</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> She is quite a special fairy.</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> The prophecy Ainsel left behind mentions only the “Child of Prophecy” can defeat her.</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> However, the Child has still not appeared...and we need their assistance as soon as possible.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> (Heheheh, that&#39;s not a good face...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Ah...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (He&#39;s gonna do it...Oberon&#39;s really gonna do it! )</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Yes, that is indeed the case, Aurora! It&#39;s funny you should say that, because there is a fairy I&#39;d like to introduce you to!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> W-wait a mo–! P-please, please stop, Oberon!</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> To tell you the truth, Artoria from Tintagel here is your shining star of hope!</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Bearing the real Staff of Selection, and here to oust Morgan, the genuine Child of Prophecy!</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Come on down!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> O-B-E-R-O-N!!!!!</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> You&#39;re all fun and games, Oberon. I&#39;d love for you to give me such an introduction one day as well.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Why thank you. I didn&#39;t expect to be so muzzled by such a direct attack, either.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> But if I didn&#39;t do something like this, Artoria would have never spoken up. She&#39;s a bit of a late bloomer, you see.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> She&#39;s still not confident she&#39;s the Child of Prophecy. So, would you mind giving her your stamp of approval?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Like, say—</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Ringing the bell, like in the prophecy?</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> !!!!?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> (whistle) Even I didn&#39;t think of going that far. Nice work.</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> No...I cannot allow that.</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> Indeed, there is a bell tower above this room. That bell is the voice of the Wind Clan.</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> If that bell is rung, it is a symbol of my acknowledgement.</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> It is not something that can be accomplished with words alone. You must have true ability and proof.</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> Artoria, is it? The prophecy also speaks of the Staff of Selection.</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> I do not know the implication of the Staff of Selection.</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> Ainsel, the Mirror head, knew the meaning. But she disappeared, and her clan&#39;s whereabouts remain unknown.</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> Therefore...allow me to discern your qualities as King with my own eyes and heart.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Determine her qualities as King...? What do you mean, specifically?</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> Oh my, what a cool voice you have. I was certain you were unable to speak.</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> In consideration of your lovely voice, I shall lay out my terms.</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> Artoria. Fujimaru. The two of you, I ask you to show me hope.</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> A sign that Britain can be changed, the dark fate that afflicts us all—</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> The Calamity that arises once every one hundred years. The curse that even Queen Morgan herself cannot dispel.</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> Several months ago, the “Calamity Pool”, a powerful Mors Current, began engulfing the port city of Norwich.</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> If you can cleanse this, I shall gladly give you Salisbury&#39;s bell.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Cleansing the calamity of Norwich, huh...that&#39;s certainly one way to break the ice.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What did she mean, the &quot;Calamity of Norwich&quot;?</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I don&#39;t know much about these Calamities either. I&#39;ve never seen one happen.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> But I&#39;ve heard the stories. Every one hundred years, a natural disaster occurs in this Fairy Kingdom.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I&#39;ve heard about these Calamities, too. I&#39;ve already explained it to Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Norwich, a port town to the east of Britain, has been showing signs of trouble for several months now.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The story goes, that black soot is soaring up and accumulating, like a rain cloud.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Aurora said that if you can excise the impending Calamity, she&#39;ll give you the Bell of Salisbury.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Cleansing clouds...I was never taught that sort of magecraft...</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Yeah, no big deal. Let&#39;s put Norwich on the back burner for the time being.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> There&#39;s a limit to what we can accomplish. More importantly, our priority lies with finding Mash.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> We got Aurora&#39;s cooperation, so give it two or three days and we should be hearing some news.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> You can wait at the inn until then.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Or maybe not. It&#39;s a waste of time to be sitting twiddling our thumbs.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I&#39;ll send you a list of errands later. You can undertake them to get some money and collect information.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Oberon?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Are you going off somewhere again?</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I&#39;ve got a few things I need to tend to. Coral&#39;s been giving me a hard time, and I have lots of debts to repay.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Then I guess we&#39;re all done here. I&#39;ll see you both in three days, in good form!</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Now then...Since everyone&#39;s resting here in Salisbury for a bit longer,</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> they should be kept busy for a while. I have to find out what&#39;s going on in Norwich.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Whoa, welcome back, Blanca. How were things up north?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Tell me, how far has Knocknarea&#39;s army advanced?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Wha—another Child of Prophecy has appeared!?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> That&#39;s...completely unexpected. It&#39;s not even a part of Ainsel&#39;s prophecy.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> More importantly, Artoria&#39;s position will be in jeopardy. It&#39;s going to be a race against the clock...</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Hmm? Is Artoria the real deal, you ask? Of course. She&#39;s definitely the Child of Prophecy.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> But at this point, it isn&#39;t about which one is the genuine article. It&#39;s about which one the fairies choose to trust.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Well, let&#39;s think of the positives.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> If a false Child of Prophecy has appeared in the north, Morgan&#39;s attention will be drawn there.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Artoria and Fujimaru will be safe for a while.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> In the meantime, they both need to grow up a bit. It&#39;s way too early to send them to Norwich.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> They&#39;ll need the ability to deal with and come out on top of Britain through their own experience, not just with words.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> “You&#39;re taking it too easy,” you say? Haha, you&#39;re so relentless, Blanca.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> But we can&#39;t rush the beginning of a story. It was the same for us, wasn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Artoria, are you unwell?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Are you worried about what was just said?</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> No, it&#39;s just not every day you get to talk to the head of a clan, so I was a little nervous. Haha...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;ve got a lot on my mind right now, so I&#39;m going to take the rest of the day off!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I&#39;ll meet you back here in the morning! Bye!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hmm...apparently, we need to change our perception of her as well.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Fujimaru, Tristan, let&#39;s go back upstairs.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> We need to discuss our plans while it&#39;s still safe to do so.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> All right, this should be okay...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Reporting on the events to date, Familiar Tifone, go~!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I&#39;ve made my report and sent it to the Storm Border. It&#39;ll be a couple of days before we hear anything.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Now, let&#39;s review what we&#39;ve been through so far. And, Morgan&#39;s not the topic of discussion today...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> The Child of Prophecy, who is foretold to be the one to defeat Queen Morgan...you mean her, don&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yeah. To tell you the truth, I think we&#39;ve been a little careless around her.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Since the only thing they have in common is their name, I hadn&#39;t put a great deal of thought into it, but she is without a doubt the King Arthur of this Lostbelt.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Chaldea confronted the legend of King Arthur once already, in the Sixth Singularity.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Let me briefly summarize the legend of King Arthur as a refresher.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It was in Great Britain during the fifth century. The country was in a state of upheaval.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The genesis of that was the collapse of the Roman Empire on the mainland. Britain&#39;s power under the protection of the Empire was waning,</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> and the foreign tribe of the Saxons invaded from across the sea.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Britain was an island nation governed by many kings and their tribes.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Despite the constant quarreling between the tribes, and the conflicts with the Picts in the north of the island,</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> the tribal kings cooperated with each other.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But, one of those kings fractured this unity.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> This king announced that he would unify Britain, using the many different tribes as tools to accomplish this.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> His name was Vortigern.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The man said to be the personification of the white dragon,</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> born from within Britain to destroy it.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Vortigern invited the Saxons to the island, throwing it into chaos.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The fortress city of Londinium, the cornerstone of Britain constructed when the Empire ruled over the island, was destroyed.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Uther Pendragon, the greatest of all the kings, lost his life in combat with Vortigern.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Thus, Britain was plunged into the Dark Ages. Everyone living on the island foresaw inescapable doom.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> However, hope was not lost.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The great sorcerer Merlin, protector of Britain and King Uther&#39;s advisor, told the people:</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> “This too, is all according to the prophecy. ”</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> “King Uther&#39;s successor has been chosen. This person is the next king. ”</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> “Whosoever draws the Sword of Selection from the stone, shall be the next King of Britain. ”</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Many knights laid their hands on the Sword of Selection, but none could pull it from the stone.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Eventually, all the knights gave up, and the Sword of Selection was abandoned as a pointless endeavour, but then...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The fifteen-year old child of King Uther, raised in secret as a squire,</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> managed to draw the Sword of Selection in secret after everyone else had left.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The name of that sword was Caliburn.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> And that youth was the next King of Britain.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> A knight among knights, Arthur Pendragon.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The Artoria Pendragon we all know and love.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> King Arthur was proclaimed Uther&#39;s successor and proceeded to unite the lords.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> She triumphed over the Saxons. She waged twelve battles against them, and won each in succession.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The ever-victorious, undefeated King of Knights.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> However, the Saxons were not the only enemies. For the King of Knights, the greatest rivals were her own kin.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Vortigern, the incarnation of the white dragon who had thrown Britain into ruin and murdered King Uther.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The Witch Queen Morgan, who heard the will of the island and claimed the throne of Britain was hers by right.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The King of Knights lost Caliburn through Morgan&#39;s trickery, but was later granted an even greater holy sword by the fairies.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That was Excalibur. The holy sword forged in the Inner Sea of the planet.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> In the world of magic, it&#39;s known as a Divine Construct, a decisive weapon meant to vanquish threats to the planet itself.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> By becoming the wielder of this holy sword, King Arthur became Britain&#39;s savior in both name and substance.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> After the decisive battle with Vortigern in the ruins of the fortress city of Londinium,</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> King Arthur built the White-Walled Castle, Camelot, with the help of the fairies.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Lords from all over the island gathered at the castle, and everyone who served the King of Knights sat at the Round Table, where all were of equal standing.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m saying this in front of Tristan, but this was the founding of the Knights of the Round Table.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Lancelot, the knight from overseas France, who bore the blessing of the Lady of the Lake.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Gawain, blessed by the sun, heir to the northern lands of Orkney where the Witch Queen Morgan had married into.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Tristan, tragic prince to the Duke of Cornwall. Said to be the symbol of the Age of Romance.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Yes...the honorable Knights of the Round Table. My sworn friends of the thirteen seats.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Mighty Percival. Skillful Kay. Loyal Bedivere. Beneficent Gaheris.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Sunny Gareth. Dutiful Agravain. Palomides the Duelist. Taciturn Mordred.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> And—the greatest of knights. The one chosen by the Holy Grail, Galahad of Revelations.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Aside from the first seat of King Arthur,</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> if you add in the seats of the advisor King Pellinore and the upcoming knight Bors, that brings it to 15 seats.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> That was the Round Table as I knew it, during its heyday.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That&#39;s right. The golden age of the Knights of the Round Table, the most glamorous age of the Arthurian legend.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> After this, despite the conclusion of the battles with the Picts and Saxons, as well as the quest for the Holy Grail,</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> the infidelity between Lancelot and Arthur&#39;s queen, Guinevere, was uncovered.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The Knights of the Round Table were greatly diminished by this incident,</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> and Mordred took advantage of King Arthur&#39;s expedition to the Roman Empire to stage a rebellion.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> This culminated in the Battle of Camlann...or the last battle of King Arthur, as it would eventually be known.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It was in this battle that King Arthur drew one last breath.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The holy sword was returned to the fairies by the hand of Sir Bedivere,</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> and the curtain fell on the history of ancient Britain.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> After that, King Arthur&#39;s remains were taken to a paradise at the ends of the world by the Lady of the Lake—</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The Once and Future King departed for Avalon.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> And that&#39;s more or less the legend of King Arthur. Thank you for your kind attention~☆</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s...already dark...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Right, I get the gist of it.</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Well then. With all that in mind, let&#39;s get back to the discussion of this Britain.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> In our history, King Arthur was an unknown squire who managed to draw the Sword of Selection,</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> and amidst the admiration and jealousy, hope and prejudice of many knights, he ascended to the throne of king.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> On the other hand, the Artoria of the Fairy Kingdom of Britain still remains unrecognized by anybody,</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> and seems to have been travelling alone through Britain as the Child of Prophecy, carrying the Staff of Selection.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The same name, the same face, the same fate. With this many parallels, there&#39;s no room for doubt.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The girl named Artoria Caster is this world&#39;s King Arthur.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The savior of Britain. Taking the role that the people wished for.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> The savior of Britain, is she...? However, this time, the age is different.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> King Arthur saved Britain in the fifth century, but it is now 2017.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> If she was the savior of Britain, would she not have appeared further in the past?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That&#39;s the thing, isn&#39;t it? I&#39;m not sure why she appeared now, of all times.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Nonetheless, I overheard something from the fairies.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> “The Child of Prophecy is the reincarnation of the savior Tonelico. They&#39;ve been sent to save Britain once again. ”</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Like the world tree of Norse mythology?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yeah. They share their name with the ash tree.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> After Morgan conquered Britain, the years changed over to the Queen&#39;s Calendar.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> This coincides with the switch to the Gregorian calendar in pan-human history.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> In the outside world, pan-human history came to a halt in 2017. In this world, the Fairy Kingdom, it is the year 2017 of the Queen&#39;s Calendar.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> So, the years before the Queen&#39;s Calendar...we would call it the BC era, right?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Here it&#39;s referred to as the Fairy Calendar,</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> and back then, there was a fairy who saved Britain from the Calamities many times.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That was the Savior, Tonelico.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Ector the Immortal, Archduke of Exhaust Heat Wryneck, Grimm the Wise, and the Knight of Beginnings, Totrot.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Their legends are still told, though it seems that most fairies don&#39;t remember them anymore.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> If we assume these saviors have appeared in the past, then saviors that appear in the Fairy Kingdom are part of a system...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> One that the island itself implements when Britain is in grave peril.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> If you think about it that way, it would account for why Artoria was born into this age.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Besides, the enemy this time is Queen Morgan. Who else would it be but King Arthur?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> The reincarnation...of the saviors...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (Even in a Lostbelt, Morgan is her enemy...)</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Well, that sure took a while, but based on all this information I have a couple of recommendations.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> One is to continue cooperating with Artoria Caster.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> We don&#39;t need to conquer this Lostbelt, but a confrontation with Queen Morgan seems unavoidable.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> At that time, being allied with her, the Child of Prophecy, can only be a plus.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> And the other thing is to keep our objective, and the true state of affairs within Chaldea, a secret.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Telling her about pan-human history is good. Otherwise we wouldn&#39;t be able to converse with her at all.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But don&#39;t disclose that Chaldea has pruned a number of Lostbelts already.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I&#39;m aware we&#39;re being dishonest. But there are times when you just have to keep secrets from one another.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> We talked about this before, but there&#39;s something fundamentally wrong with this Lostbelt. There are too many parts of it that just don&#39;t add up.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Until we can explain this, we should restrict our objective to “stop the annihilation of Britain. ”</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Even if the Britain we save ends up becoming our next opponent...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I understand...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You want me to keep Artoria in the dark?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yeah. I&#39;m sorry, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But my instincts are saying we must avoid telling her at all costs.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> We&#39;ll save Britain, and prevent the Collapse from spreading across the bleached Earth.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> When all is said and done, we&#39;ll say goodbye to her with a smiling face, never having needed to turn against this Britain.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Everyone, good morning~! Breakfast is ready!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> The bread here is the best, it&#39;s so soft! This is...wheat, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Ah, you&#39;re bright-eyed and bushy-tailed this morning, Artoria.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Huh? But I&#39;m always like this. Even when I&#39;m feeling down, I get right back on my feet! That&#39;s my specialty!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Wheat? Flour wheat?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yeah, that wheat.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Amazingly, the wheat here is of a far superior quality when compared to ours.</p><hr><p><strong>Fairy Tavernkeep:</strong> Ah! Dabinchi taught me how to make bread!</p><p><strong>Fairy Tavernkeep:</strong> I didn&#39;t know you could use flour in cooking! I always thought it was completely useless!</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> To have lived in buildings up until now, and not understood the value of flour...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> It appears there are differences in the level of knowledge between individual fairies.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> No, it is more like—</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yeah. Seems like there are two kinds of fairies: those who mimic human culture in form only,</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> and those who have an interest in understanding the inner workings of their technology.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Most fairies are content to “imitate”...to just play along with it all.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> They have no need to understand how it all works, since fairies can survive just fine without human technology.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You know how cars got more advanced, and required less maintenance from their drivers,</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> so inevitably, the number of drivers who knew how they actually work went down? Something like that.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Whenever they feel like eating something like bread, the fairies just use their magical energy to create it like ☆poof☆~</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But that&#39;s nothing more than an imitation of “bread I tasted before. ” Like 3D printing.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Fairies can only enjoy the intricacies of “human culture” when they have the original data.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Mike here, well, he&#39;s just a typical copycat.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Since I started working here, we&#39;ve gotten into all kinds of stuff.</p><p><strong>Fairy Tavernkeep:</strong> Th-that&#39;s right...</p><p><strong>Fairy Tavernkeep:</strong> I was a simple, boring fairy until I met Dabinchi...</p><p><strong>Fairy Tavernkeep:</strong> But now, every day is fun and delightful! My life is amazing!</p><p><strong>Fairy Tavernkeep:</strong> In the past, I thought protecting humans was a selfish thing to do, but not any more.</p><p><strong>Fairy Tavernkeep:</strong> Lady Aurora was right. We need humans to enjoy life.</p><p><strong>Fairy Tavernkeep:</strong> Humans amass skills anyway. They make interesting, unnatural things.</p><p><strong>Fairy Tavernkeep:</strong> Sometimes it&#39;s something that&#39;s not tasty or fun, like iron or gunpowder...</p><p><strong>Fairy Tavernkeep:</strong> But, I recognize humans as my equals now. I respect them.</p><p><strong>Fairy Tavernkeep:</strong> It was a bother when this shop was handed down to me...or so I thought. But I was wrong.</p><p><strong>Fairy Tavernkeep:</strong> We need a reason to live. We need something to do other than “what we want. ”</p><p><strong>Fairy Tavernkeep:</strong> I can&#39;t stand the thought of just “being” any more!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> —</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Well, fundamentally, fairies are innocent. You could even say, “easily influenced”.</p><p><strong>Fairy Tavernkeep:</strong> That&#39;s not true! You&#39;re something special, Dabinchi! I&#39;ve never had such inspiration, not even from Lady Aurora!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yeah, yeah. Then you&#39;d better start learning to pronounce “da Vinci” correctly.</p><p><strong>Fairy Tavernkeep:</strong> I&#39;ll get it right, I swear! Oh yeah, you&#39;ve got a message from Oberon.</p><p><strong>Fairy Tavernkeep:</strong> “Come to the fields of Salisbury. Social studies are important, after all! ”</p><p><strong>Fairy Tavernkeep:</strong> That&#39;s what he said!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Huh? Social studies?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s—</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I think we&#39;re in business!</p><hr><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Field Fairy:</strong> I see, so that&#39;s how you get rid of vermin like that...that&#39;s good to know.</p><p><strong>Field Fairy:</strong> No matter how much I talked to them, they wouldn&#39;t leave, so I was at a loss as to what to do...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Fields are delicate things. At times like that, it is good to take a firm stance.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> And taking your kind desire to not injure the bird into account...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> From now on it would be good to place a statue in your likeness in the field to keep the birds in check...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> The birds will assume you are watching them, and they will attack your statue first...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Such stalling for time may lead to something...</p><p><strong>Field Fairy:</strong> My...!</p><p><strong>Field Fairy:</strong> Are you a genius...?</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Heh, I will not deny it...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (That&#39;s not how scarecrows work, you know...)</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Umm...is Tristan always like this?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yeah. He&#39;s a knight with his head stuck in the clouds...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> If he had a partner that kept him more down-to-earth, he&#39;d be the perfect knight...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> More importantly, what about the fields of Salisbury? They&#39;re nothing more than another imitation of human society, made by the fairies.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> They&#39;re enormous.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> For what it&#39;s worth, they&#39;re real.</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yeah, regardless of the method to get there, the finished product is the genuine article.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I&#39;d heard that agriculture has thrived in the northern parts of Britain for a long time, but not so much in the south.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Under Aurora&#39;s direction, they finally started in earnest here in Salisbury.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> There were small fields in my village too, but this is the first time I&#39;ve seen one so large!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> But why has it been so unpopular until now?</p><p><strong>Field Fairy:</strong> That&#39;s because when the Mors appeared, we had no choice but to abandon these fields.</p><p><strong>Field Fairy:</strong> It seems like there&#39;s not a lot of Mors up north, so you&#39;re free to tend your own fields as you please.</p><p><strong>Field Fairy:</strong> Down south, there are frequent outbreaks of Mors, so only the strongest fairies can leave the cities.</p><p><strong>Field Fairy:</strong> I&#39;ve heard that the Fang Clan just say “death is a part of war! ” and bear it up to a point, but...</p><p><strong>Field Fairy:</strong> A low-ranking fairy like me, with no Astrality—no Alien Common Sense—I can&#39;t even approach the Mors...</p><p><strong>Field Fairy:</strong> Besides, even if you cultivate a farm, you have to rebuild it every hundred years or so...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> The Calamity that occurs once every hundred years. Even those of you without long lives fear it, huh?</p><p><strong>Field Fairy:</strong> Of course we do! When the disaster comes, only the fairies allowed inside Camelot will survive.</p><p><strong>Field Fairy:</strong> We&#39;ll all suffer and die. There isn&#39;t a single fairy in Britain who doesn&#39;t fear the Calamity!</p><p><strong>Field Fairy:</strong> Even Lady Aurora...how long can her radiance last? After what happened to Norwich...</p><p><strong>Field Fairy:</strong> If Norwich is swallowed by the Calamity, Salisbury is definitely next.</p><p><strong>Field Fairy:</strong> If that happens...this time, Lady Aurora will...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Can&#39;t Lady Aurora escape to Camelot?</p><p><strong>Field Fairy:</strong> Yes...Lady Aurora was granted permission to enter, but none of the other fairies were...</p><p><strong>Field Fairy:</strong> “If the people of Salisbury are not accepted, I shall not enter Camelot. ”</p><p><strong>Field Fairy:</strong> When Lady Aurora responded that way, Her Majesty became extremely mad,</p><p><strong>Field Fairy:</strong> and forbade Lady Aurora from entering Camelot.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What exactly is a &quot;Calamity? &quot;</p><p><strong>Field Fairy:</strong> I don&#39;t know...The Calamities don&#39;t have a fixed form.</p><p><strong>Field Fairy:</strong> It&#39;s said that different forms of Calamity appear at different times.</p><p><strong>Field Fairy:</strong> If I recall...last time Darlington disappeared in the “Resurrection Calamity”, or something like that.</p><p><strong>Field Fairy:</strong> I wonder what terrible thing will arise this time...</p><p><strong>Field Fairy:</strong> Ah, why did I have to be born at this time? Why couldn&#39;t the previous generation endure another ten years...</p><p><strong>Field Fairy:</strong> No, why can&#39;t Her Majesty just open the gates of Camelot to everybody in the first place...</p><p><strong>Field Fairy:</strong> It would be great if they could shelter us in Camelot, even if it were just one year...</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I see...You&#39;re dissatisfied with Her Majesty as well, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> There have been demonstrations against the Queen occurring all over lately. If you want to protest against her, why don&#39;t you join one?</p><p><strong>Field Fairy:</strong> Ah...</p><p><strong>Field Fairy:</strong> No, I&#39;d rather not go that far...it&#39;s not like I&#39;m disobeying the Queen in the first place...</p><p><strong>Field Fairy:</strong> The Calamities are terrible, but the Queen&#39;s army is even worse.</p><p><strong>Field Fairy:</strong> Her Majesty&#39;s magical energy extends beyond simply covering all of Britain.</p><p><strong>Field Fairy:</strong> She has trained Fairy Soldiers, and blessed Knights to command them—</p><p><strong>Field Fairy:</strong> Tristan of the Bewitched Strings, Gawain of the Sun, and Lancelot of the Shining Lake.</p><p><strong>Field Fairy:</strong> As long as those three Fairy Knights stand in the way, nobody can rebel against Her Majesty.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> —Wha?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> —Huh!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> —Say what?</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> ...? (Why is everyone so surprised? )</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The emergency meeting is called to order!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The topic of discussion is the fairy knights! The three Fairy Knights in the service of Queen Morgan!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> By the way, did you know about this, Artoria!?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Yes, it&#39;s common knowledge around here. Is this really such a big deal, though?</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Yes, a great surprise for sure, akin to Sir Bedivere awakening from his sleep...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Artoria, could you please elaborate on this?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Huh...well, it&#39;s something everybody here simply knows.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> The Fairy Knights are fairies gifted the names of knights from an alternate world by Queen Morgan.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Their magical energy is the greatest in the land, second only to the Queen herself.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Also, they can&#39;t be corrupted through contact with Mors. So when a swarm of them appears, they subjugate them.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Ah. Now that I mention it, they have another name.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Guardians of Britain who have all taken an oath under the Queen: the Knights of the Round Table.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> The Fairy Round Table...!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Ah! You beat me to it! I was going to say that too!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Does Morgan actually like King Arthur, then?</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> No, &#39;tis nothing but mere mockery...the Witch Queen finds amusement in such harassment...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> That is, if the Morgan of this Lostbelt possesses the same character as the Morgan I know.</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Guys, do you all have some emotional attachment to the term? It&#39;s just a table, right? A round table?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> There&#39;s no getting around it. I guess we have to tell you about your pan-human history self.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Artoria. In our world, Queen Morgan existed as well.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But she&#39;s from a tale from the fifth century, so she&#39;s about 1,600 years old.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> At that time, there was a king who bested Morgan, united Britain, and led it into an age of peace.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That king&#39;s name was Arthur. Her hidden name was Artoria Pendragon.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Ooh, Artoria. The same name as me.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> More than that, she was probably the same being.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Alright, listen. Don&#39;t be surprised by what I&#39;m about to tell you.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> In our world, you&#39;re the sovereign of Britain, a king commanding the respect of many knights.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> —</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Indeed. The ideal king, chosen by the “Sword of Selection” and trained by the magus Merlin.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> She ruled by disguising herself as a boy, though.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> King Arthur had many lords in her service. Think of them like the Fairy Kingdom&#39;s six clans.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> And the most outstanding knights among these lords were the “Knights of the Round Table. ” Knights unparalleled throughout history.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> To tell you the truth, Sir Tristan here is one of them.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Meaning, from our point of view, the Knights of the Round Table under Morgan are:</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> “Heroes of justice, unknowingly following an evil dictator,”</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> more or less. It&#39;s a shock, don&#39;t you think?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hello? Are you listening, Artoria?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> —</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Oh shoot, she froze in astonishment!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I know how you feel, but pull yourself together!</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> H-hah, haha...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I see...so I really was the Child of Prophecy after all...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I was thinking maybe, just maybe, everybody had the wrong idea...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Well, that&#39;s how it is!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> After all, the old man said I was born together with the “Staff of Selection”!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> All right, I feel a little more confident now!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Pendragon, was it? I&#39;m going to follow their example and save Britain!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> And there&#39;s a Knight of the Round Table here too!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Well, you had the same name as <em>that</em> Tristan, so I wondered if you were actually just really bloodthirsty,</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> but you really were a Knight of the Round Table! So cool!</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> As a knight, I am overjoyed to hear you say so, but...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> What did you mean by “bloodthirsty”? You could not mean...the Tristan of the Fairy Kingdom...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> They say she&#39;s the most brutal, ruthless, irritable, and indiscriminate fairy at the Round Table.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> She&#39;s known as the “Fairy Slayer,” or “Tristan of the Bloody Heel. ”</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Since she became a fairy knight 100 years ago, she&#39;s killed roughly 400,000 fairies, or so they say.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> But you&#39;re the complete opposite.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> The way you fought together with Fujimaru was, how can I say it, like a flower amidst a tempest.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Keeping your poise and dignity, and doing your best no matter how rough it gets—</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> There aren&#39;t many people like that in this land.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> It may have been a different world, but it&#39;s encouraging to think that someone like you placed your trust in me.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> That is...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Yes...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Quite so. I shall remember to conduct myself accordingly.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Though, now I get it. I guess “Fairy Knight” is more than just a title, huh...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Hm...? Huh? But what you said about Fujimaru&#39;s world...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> (Fairy Knight Tristan was appointed 100 years ago...after pan-human history&#39;s Tristan...)</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> (The original–the prototype Tristan is here, and the Fairy Knight is an imitation...)</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> (Has Her Majesty known about pan-human history for some time...? )</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> What an unexpected unfolding, to end up telling Artoria about King Arthur...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Well, that much is probably fine. And we now know more about the Fairy Knights.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Seriously, had we met one without any prior knowledge, I might have died of shock!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Well, they won&#39;t necessarily look like the Tristan and Gawain we&#39;re familiar with...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Either way, seeing as they have the same name, they probably share some characteristics.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Tristan would have Failnaught and Lancelot would have Arondight, I assume.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yeah.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> By the way, where is Tristan?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Artoria&#39;s room. He wanted to talk to her privately.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> The white dragon who called for the destruction of Britain when it was an “ancient island of Sacraments”...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> The vile king, Vortigern.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> The wrath of Britain...the incarnation of the will that tried to reject the age of man.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> And created to oppose him, raised as the incarnation of the red dragon...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Artoria Pendragon.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> The king who protected the people of Britain, preserved the country, and established the world of man.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Afterwards, fairies and Sacraments faded from the island,</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> but the result was the preservation of Britain&#39;s culture, passing it on to future generations.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> ...King Arthur didn&#39;t become King because she was strong,</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> but because she fought for the future of Britain.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> That is why the Knights of the Round Table ceased fighting and sat at the same table.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Yes. Each and every one of us saw hope in the king.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Level-headed in war, yet just in rule.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> In addition, she cherished all of Britain.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> With her small body, she was willing to fight and be injured by enemies many times stronger than her.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> That&#39;s...she must have been an amazing king...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Yes...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> She was the bravest, most poignant, and...proudest person I ever knew.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> However, the king was not flawless from the onset.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> She spent the years after pulling the Sword of Selection training with Merlin and Sir Kay.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> As such, there is no need to be in a rush now...or so I believe.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> You do not just share her name, Artoria. You have her eyes.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Please believe in yourself. I believe you can do it.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> King Arthur...a greater me from a different world...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Amazing. She must have worked so hard.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> We&#39;re baaack! Tell us we did a good job, Mike!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> We finished three tumultuous Oberon Quests in a row, or something!</p><p><strong>Fairy Tavernkeep:</strong> O-oh. That means you&#39;re desperate or something, right? Is apple juice good? I&#39;ll get you some.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Thanks Mike, you&#39;re so thoughtful~☆ You&#39;re getting used to being a tavernkeep!</p><p><strong>Fairy Tavernkeep:</strong> Oh stop it~. You&#39;re an angel~. It&#39;s all thanks to Dabinchi~.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Arbitrating a sunshine rights dispute between the Wind and Earth Clans on Main Street...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Confirming the safety of a mysterious gift sent to the head of the Wind Clan (which turned out to be a massive bouquet)...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Suppressing a Wind Clan member who became desperate after falling in love with a human they met thirty years ago...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> With that all finished, they were quite difficult, but I believe they were all worth doing.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I was nervous at first, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> In the end, everyone was smiling and happy!</p><hr><p><strong>Fairy Tavernkeep:</strong> Oh yeah. You, the human. Fujimaru, right?</p><p><strong>Fairy Tavernkeep:</strong> You&#39;ve got a guest in your room. She gets scary when she&#39;s kept waiting, so get going.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> A visitor for Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Coral:</strong> So...this is a room for humans...it&#39;s not too different from ours...</p><p><strong>Coral:</strong> No, we&#39;re the ones following their example, we really must thank them for that...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Coming in~</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Excuse me~</p><hr><p><strong>Coral:</strong> It seems you&#39;ve returned, human.</p><p><strong>Coral:</strong> Your work at the fields yesterday is appreciated. As a member of the Wind Clan, you have my thanks.</p><p><strong>Coral:</strong> ......</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Uh, what is it...?</p><hr><p><strong>Coral:</strong> We&#39;ve received some information...</p><p><strong>Coral:</strong> Every human captured in southern Britain is housed in a farm to the west...</p><p><strong>Coral:</strong> It seems that three days ago, a new human was interred there.</p><p><strong>Coral:</strong> It may be the person you have been searching for. If you are going to rescue them, I will prepare guides.</p><p><strong>Coral:</strong> Tonight, I will station a few soldiers outside of Salisbury.</p><p><strong>Coral:</strong> Meet with them, and finish your work for tonight.</p><p><strong>Coral:</strong> “I pray for your safety, and that you are reunited with your friend,” Lady Aurora wished me to say to you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> —!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Thank you, Coral!</p><hr><p><strong>Coral:</strong> Thank Lady Aurora, not me. Now, I must return to my duties.</p><p><strong>Coral:</strong> I do not know what situation you are in, and I am in no position to offer my opinion, however...</p><p><strong>Coral:</strong> The farm is under Her Majesty&#39;s control. Security will be tight, so prepare accordingly.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> —and that&#39;s what she said.</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> They told us it would take two or three days, but it took them the shortest time, two days exactly. Not bad.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Interred three days ago...we have no time to lose.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> We do not know what sort of facility this “farm” is, but we should not hesitate.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yeah. Oberon hasn&#39;t come back, but I won&#39;t complain as long as we have some guides.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Now, as for Artoria?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> This is our own problem, so you should stay here...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Of course I&#39;ll help you.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Our fates crossed when I ended up using her name, so I would like to meet her in person.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> More importantly, I&#39;ve gotten a lot more confident in the last few days! Breaking and entering, lockpicking, sleeping pills...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> With Merlin&#39;s magecraft I can do a little bit of everything, so you can count on me!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Alright, let&#39;s go!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;ll ask about &quot;Merlin&#39;s magic&quot; later...</p><hr><p>Note! Scene Change</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> It seems those soldiers are our guides...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> How surprising. They are human soldiers, and not fairies.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yeah, there are a lot of human soldiers in Salisbury. Their strength doesn&#39;t compare to the fairies,</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> but humans aren&#39;t opposed to carrying weapons, and more importantly, they can approach the Mors without fear.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> “Human soldiers” are an anti-Mors measure. The clans probably feel that they&#39;re expendable.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Still, Aurora treasures human soldiers, and promotes the most able as her guards.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Remember the cathedral guards?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The fact that they were so strong is proof that Aurora bestows all sorts of privileges onto humans.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Artoria?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Are you not be feeling well?</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Ah...no, I&#39;m just a little anxious. It&#39;s my first time working with so many people, so...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Ahaha, Fujimaru is so calm, it&#39;s funny...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Please be quiet. It seems they&#39;ve noticed us.</p><p><strong>Soldiers of Salisbury, A:</strong> Hey, weird folks over there. Are you the ones Coral told us about?</p><p><strong>Soldiers of Salisbury, A:</strong> So you came after all. Why go to all this trouble at this time of the year...</p><p><strong>Soldiers of Salisbury, A:</strong> Well, it can&#39;t be helped. This too is for Lady Aurora&#39;s sake. All right, follow me.</p><p><strong>Soldiers of Salisbury, A:</strong> I&#39;ll guide you to the farm. From here, it&#39;s two hours on foot. You all set?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Of course.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Please do.</p><hr><p><strong>Soldiers of Salisbury, A:</strong> Sigh...what a bunch of weirdos...Lady Aurora sure is weak to the unusual...</p><p>Note! Scene Change</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hm. Seems like we&#39;re not welcome somehow.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> From their point of view, do we look like a bunch of creepy suitors trying to woo Lady Aurora?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Still, they&#39;re helping us out of good faith, so we should be thankful.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Let&#39;s go, Fujimaru. Looks like there won&#39;t be any small talk from hereon out. Too bad.</p><p><strong>Soldiers of Salisbury, A:</strong> We&#39;re here. This is the western human farm.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Human...farm...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Is this the right place...?</p><hr><p><strong>Soldiers of Salisbury, A:</strong> Yeah. We once lived here too.</p><p><strong>Soldiers of Salisbury, A:</strong> I was assigned to an awful fairy. They broke me in just about every way, then tossed me aside like garbage.</p><p><strong>Soldiers of Salisbury, A:</strong> Lady Aurora gave lost humans like me a place to belong.</p><p><strong>Soldiers of Salisbury, A:</strong> We became soldiers in order to win the freedom that Lady Aurora showed us.</p><p><strong>Soldiers of Salisbury, A:</strong> We have the will to oppose the Queen.</p><p><strong>Soldiers of Salisbury, A:</strong> Rebels these days don&#39;t need to rely on something like the Child of Prophecy.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> A rebel army...we heard mention of them before, but are there other movements opposing the Queen, aside from Salisbury?</p><p><strong>Soldiers of Salisbury, A:</strong> Yeah. A bunch of them have taken over a ruined castle out east. They&#39;re campaigning for the liberation of Britain.</p><p><strong>Soldiers of Salisbury, A:</strong> But they named themselves the “Round Table” of all things...still, they&#39;re no joke in terms of warpower.</p><p><strong>Soldiers of Salisbury, A:</strong> The one in charge managed to survive against Lancelot in the games at Camelot.</p><p><strong>Soldiers of Salisbury, A:</strong> Morgan was so impressed that a human was able to stand up to a Fairy Knight, she awarded him a position as one of her soldiers.</p><p><strong>Soldiers of Salisbury, A:</strong> I think his name was—yeah, Percival. Percival of the White Light, the pinnacle of human ability.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> —!</p><p><strong>Soldiers of Salisbury, A:</strong> Because of his ability, Morgan ordered him to enter Camelot, despite being a human.</p><p><strong>Soldiers of Salisbury, A:</strong> But the weirdo defied her, and founded the rebel army instead.</p><p><strong>Soldiers of Salisbury, B:</strong> Hey, that&#39;s far enough. Going any farther is dangerous.</p><p><strong>Soldiers of Salisbury, B:</strong> If we&#39;re seen here, it&#39;ll make trouble for Lady Aurora.</p><p><strong>Soldiers of Salisbury, B:</strong> This is as far as we stick with you shabby country fairies. We&#39;re heading back to Salisbury.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> So you just came along to show us the way...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You&#39;re saying that sneaking into the ranch and looking for someone is our own job?</p><p><strong>Soldiers of Salisbury, A:</strong> Less your job and more your own problem now. You should be grateful we led you this far.</p><p><strong>Soldiers of Salisbury, A:</strong> The Wind Clan may be versatile, but we&#39;re not suited for combat.</p><p><strong>Soldiers of Salisbury, A:</strong> If Morgan sees us as hostile, she&#39;ll destroy both Salisbury and Lady Aurora.</p><p><strong>Soldiers of Salisbury, A:</strong> And Lady Aurora asked us to help you lot out, despite the danger.</p><p><strong>Soldiers of Salisbury, A:</strong> So listen...if you manage to get yourselves caught, don&#39;t mention Salisbury.</p><p><strong>Soldiers of Salisbury, A:</strong> There will be no need to return the favor. Provided you have even a shred of dignity towards humans.</p><p>Note! Scene Change</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Let&#39;s hash out our plan here. I&#39;ve just finished the structural analysis.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> The sense I got from it is that there are six large factories inside, and about thirty smaller workshops.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> There are no sources of heat inside the larger ones, so they seem to be shut down at the moment.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> The smaller ones have a much larger heat signature, and probably accommodate about 60 humans.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> What should we do, Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> We could climb the walls and get in without being seen by the guards.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;re really good with your hands, Artoria.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I-it&#39;s not like I like doing this...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> It&#39;s a skill that lets me grasp the inner workings of a structure by sending a wave of magical energy out in a cone, then reading the response through the wall.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Basic burglary magecraft taught to me by Merlin, since he thought I&#39;d need it!</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Heh, how nostalgic...Merlin is the same in any world...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Has something upset you...?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> No, not at all. I was just focused on figuring out the situation inside.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Forget about those people who just said whatever they wanted and ran off, and go look for Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hrm. Do you feel a connection through your contract with Mash, Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It&#39;s the quickest way to be sure.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Maybe yes, maybe no...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It&#39;s close, yet far...</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I wonder if you&#39;re confused or unsure. To tell the truth, I&#39;m getting the same feeling.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The Fairy Kingdom has far too many “contracts” formed in it.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Maybe when fairies come to own humans, they forge a bond similar to a Servant&#39;s contract.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Looks like the only way to find out if Mash is captured or not is to check directly.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Tristan, can you carry Fujimaru and Artoria over the wall?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Ah, I&#39;m alright, I&#39;ll skate up.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Of course. Silent, magnificent wire action...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> No, I shall display my lyre action. This way, you two.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I&#39;ll lead the way. The western wall is undermanned, so let&#39;s go up that one!</p><p>Note! Scene Change</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s a city inside too...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (There&#39;s nobody around, but...)</p><hr><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Artoria. By large factories did you mean building complexes, and by smaller ones did you mean residences?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Yes. Humans kept on a farm are shipped with their creativity preserved.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Therefore, their imprisonment takes the form of a residential dwelling.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> You can disregard the big factory. Mash won&#39;t be there.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> It&#39;s not the birthing period now, so there shouldn&#39;t be anything inside there.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> —</p><p><strong>???:</strong></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png" alt="1-light">？</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Artoria, behind you!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> There&#39;s something there!</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> A surveillance familiar...! I see, it was disguised as the light of a lamp...!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I screwed up again...sorry everyone! If we don&#39;t beat that thing, a lot more will show up!</p><p><strong>???:</strong></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png" alt="1-light"></p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> We&#39;ve defeated so many, but there&#39;s no end to them! There&#39;s got to be a fairy somewhere controlling them!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Fujimaru, can you look for them!? Our hands are full with the familiars!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> —Leave it to me—!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (Stay calm, and keep your eyes open...! )</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> There! There&#39;s something in the shadow of that building!</p><hr><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Certainly, that is the only place with no sound. They seem to be able to hide in the shadows—</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> No shield can protect from my Fantasia...shall I divide your torso into four?</p><p><strong>Fairy in Armor:</strong> D-damn—what the hell are you? That weird trick you just pulled...you&#39;re neither human nor fairy.</p><p><strong>Fairy in Armor:</strong> And you&#39;re not Mors or part of the Round Table...could you be the Child of Prophecy?</p><p><strong>Fairy in Armor:</strong> Hah. Hahahah! This is great, it&#39;s my lucky day!</p><p><strong>Fairy in Armor:</strong> My name is Grant, Grant the Knight! The Child of Prophecy&#39;s magecraft is no match for the Queen&#39;s power!</p><p><strong>E：Knight Grant:</strong> Don&#39;t assume this armor will break from one or two hits! It was granted to me by Queen Morgan herself...!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Wha! What&#39;s in that thing? Not only a fairy, but...!?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Be careful everyone! That&#39;s probably one of the Fairy Knights we&#39;ve heard about...!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>D：Knight Grant:</strong> Gah—</p><p><strong>D：Knight Grant:</strong> How shameful...for a knight of Camelot...to lose to one so small—</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> He&#39;s down and not moving...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Did we beat him...?</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> We did it, we won! He was super strong, but we defeated a Fairy Knight!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Well, it was thanks to you all!</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> No...he was probably just a regular knight.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> There is no Knight of the Round Table by the name of Grant. Moreover, over there.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Aah, there&#39;s still three of them left, and they have as much magical energy as the one from before~!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Just one was a handful. This is too much for us!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Let&#39;s fall back for now, Fujimaru!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> But—</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> We still don&#39;t know about Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Armed Soldier:</strong> All right, we&#39;re through the gate–! Squads 1 and 3, you&#39;re with me! Let&#39;s hit Morgan&#39;s troops from the front!</p><p><strong>Armed Soldier:</strong> Squad 2, take control of the factory! Release our comrades inside before they can be processed!</p><p><strong>Morgan&#39;s Soldier:</strong> Reinforcements from the gate!? The Child of Prophecy was a diversion...!</p><p><strong>Morgan&#39;s Soldier:</strong> Never mind that, first we have to retake the gate! That&#39;s Londinium&#39;s rebel army!</p><p><strong>Morgan&#39;s Soldier:</strong> Some of them are armed with Mors-poisoned iron! Don&#39;t underestimate them, they&#39;re tough!</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> This...it seems we have some unexpected reinforcements. Are they the rebel army we heard about...?</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> They may be weaker in individual abilities, but their numbers are vastly overwhelming.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> It is only a matter of time. The three Fairy Knights are sure to be killed.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yeah, sure looks that way. They saved us in the nick of time, but...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> After they defeat the fairies, they might not be so friendly to us.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Let&#39;s look for Mash while we can, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> We should contact the rebels after that. Artoria, can I ask you to lead the way?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> T-that&#39;s right! Leave it to me, lockpicking is my specialty!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> It&#39;s as da Vinci says, they may be rebels, but they&#39;re not necessarily on our side.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Let&#39;s find Mash before anything else happens, and escape before we&#39;re discovered!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Aw shucks...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> As expected of a facility under the Queen&#39;s direct control...this magic lock is top-of-the-line...dang it...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> While we worked on just one, the Round Table forces opened all 29 others...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> They even opened that last one for us...hahaha...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Don&#39;t be so down, Artoria. Well, as an engineer, I can understand how you feel.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But thanks to these efforts, all the people imprisoned in the residences were able to be freed.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It&#39;s too bad Mash wasn&#39;t among them...but that doesn&#39;t mean this was all a big waste of time.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> At least Mash hasn&#39;t been caught. Depending on how you look at it, this is actually the better outcome.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> —Yeah. I&#39;m sure Mash is alright.</p><hr><p><strong>Round Table Army Soldier:</strong> Everyone, this way please. We&#39;ve got more than enough food and coats to go around.</p><p><strong>Round Table Army Soldier:</strong> After we&#39;ve checked everyone&#39;s names and conditions, we&#39;ll move out.</p><p><strong>Round Table Army Soldier:</strong> Are there any humans left inside? If you have any information, please let us know.</p><p><strong>Incarcerated Man:</strong> Impossible...an army of humans. An army of humans defeated the Queen&#39;s soldiers!</p><p><strong>Incarcerated Man:</strong> So the rumors of the Round Table Army are true! We won&#39;t have to live at their mercy anymore!</p><p><strong>Incarcerated Child:</strong> I can go outside...?</p><p><strong>Incarcerated Child:</strong> But the knights told me to study until I grew up, since the outside is dangerous and humans would die right away.</p><p><strong>Incarcerated Woman:</strong> Two years...I haven&#39;t been outside in two years...I need to get back to Gloucester soon...</p><p><strong>Incarcerated Woman:</strong> I left behind someone important. We were separated.</p><p><strong>Incarcerated Woman:</strong> My child...how have they fared without me?</p><p><strong>Bound Soldiers of Morgan:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Nevertheless, these Round Table soldiers are splendidly managed.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> The defeated and surviving knights were restrained, rather than killed.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> They are a well-organized army, not a mere murderous horde.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> The greatest of the human knights who founded the Round Table Army, Percival...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> I am overjoyed...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> It may not be the same Sir Percival that I know, but he has earned the name he shares with him...</p><p><strong>Round Table Army Soldier:</strong> Ah, you guys. Thanks for earlier, you were a big help.</p><p><strong>Round Table Army Soldier:</strong> We&#39;ve been watching this place closely for the last few months, so we knew they were short handed today.</p><p><strong>Round Table Army Soldier:</strong> But I never thought anyone would break in ahead of us. And it only took four people to take down one of Morgan&#39;s knights.</p><p><strong>Round Table Army Soldier:</strong> We were prepared to take casualties of up to 20%, but thanks to you, we&#39;ve only sustained a few injuries.</p><p><strong>Round Table Army Soldier:</strong> So which city&#39;s rebel group are you from? I&#39;ve never seen you guys in the south...are you from up north?</p><p><strong>Round Table Army Soldier:</strong> That&#39;s right...I heard there was an uprising in Sheffield...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> —</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Artoria...?</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> —Um, are all of you really...?</p><p><strong>Round Table Army Soldier:</strong> Huh? Oh, right. We&#39;re the only ones who call fairies “people” nowadays.</p><p><strong>Round Table Army Soldier:</strong> It doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re a fairy or a human, everyone in the Round Table Army is a “person. ”</p><p><strong>Round Table Army Soldier:</strong> That&#39;s why I called you four people...was that rude?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> N-no, that&#39;s not it...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> —Um...in the Round Table Army, is everyone like you?</p><p><strong>Round Table Army Soldier:</strong> Hahaha. Well, I don&#39;t know about that. Everyone has different motives and ways of thinking.</p><p><strong>Round Table Army Soldier:</strong> But we all believe in the boss. The ideals Percival set forth are enough reason to fight.</p><p><strong>Round Table Army Soldier:</strong> “The Child of Prophecy will definitely come forth. Gather comrades for that moment. ”</p><p><strong>Round Table Army Soldier:</strong> “To support the Child of Prophecy who bears so heavy a responsibility, lay the groundwork to oppose the Queen. ”</p><p><strong>Round Table Army Soldier:</strong> The boss always says that...oh, it&#39;s getting too noisy.</p><p><strong>Round Table Army Soldier:</strong> Seems like the muster&#39;s over. We&#39;ll escort the people to Londinium.</p><p><strong>Round Table Army Soldier:</strong> What about you guys? Good fighters are always welcome there.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> That&#39;s...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m sorry. We have to decline.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> We&#39;ve got something else to take care of right now.</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Yes. We&#39;re honored by your invitation, but we&#39;re in the middle of looking for someone right now.</p><p><strong>Round Table Army Soldier:</strong> I see...that&#39;s a shame. But if you&#39;ve decided, there&#39;s no helping it.</p><p><strong>Round Table Army Soldier:</strong> Take care, everyone. I hope you find who you&#39;re looking for safe and sound.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> And there he goes...I gotta say, that seemed like a good offer. Why&#39;d you turn it down, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Well, Artoria didn&#39;t seem to like the idea...</p><hr><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> If I said I was not interested in the Round Table Army, that would be a lie. However...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Our highest priority is to reunite with Mash. We have not yet had that chance, I think is what they want to say.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Of course! As expected of one of the original Round Table&#39;s gentlemen!</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Heh...I am Tristan the Lamenting, a knight who lives not only for the greater good...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> However, if it were Sir Bedivere here in my place, the choice before him would be quite grave—</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> —! Fujimaru! On the ground!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I didn&#39;t think the gap in our security would be exploited. Only the most clever could have gotten this far.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> But it&#39;s not enough. Such poor, weak conviction. How very human.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> If you&#39;re going to hide in the shadows and steal all our work, then you&#39;ll have no objections to being trampled, will you?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> What a bizarre magical energy reaction...! I can&#39;t measure it, what the—!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (Living things, bound with chains...! )</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (Those flames just now...the Round Table Army)</p><hr><p><strong>Round Table Army Soldier:</strong> Squad 2, Squad 3, are you all right...!? Crap, how many of them got swallowed up!?</p><p><strong>Round Table Army Soldier:</strong> Are we the only ones left!? It can&#39;t be, this wall of fire—</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Hm. A few left over. If we were in the plains, I would have swallowed you all...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> This farm is the property of Her Majesty Morgan. Such destruction is unacceptable.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> My horn will butcher the rest of you. Resist if you dare, humans.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I have no time for cowards. If you are brave, I will show mercy.</p><p><strong>Round Table Army Soldier:</strong> That&#39;s impossible...why is SHE here...?</p><p><strong>Round Table Army Soldier:</strong> That greatsword of black flames and silver armor...the fairy-devouring Black Dog...</p><p><strong>Round Table Army Soldier:</strong> Fairy Knight Gawain! Why is the Queen&#39;s right hand here!?</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> —You.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> If all you&#39;re going to do is butter me up and not draw your sword, my horn has no need to cross with you.</p><p><strong>O：Gawain&#39;s Soldier, A:</strong> Lord Gawain. We&#39;ve captured all the escaped humans.</p><p><strong>P：Gawain&#39;s Soldier, B:</strong> We&#39;ll round up these thieves. One human and three fairies will pose no problem.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> No...they are my prey. Stand down.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (This intimidating air, it&#39;s just like Gawain in the Holy City...! )</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> You as well...? I had expected a bit more from you than the other humans.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> They&#39;ve become nothing more than this land&#39;s livestock. Such frail meat barely sates the appetite.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (I can&#39;t get swallowed up...talk first...! )</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> —Got a bit of a backbone, do you? Good, my appetite&#39;s riled up and my tongue is itching for a taste.</p><hr><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> There is no need to give me your name. I have no interest in such things.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> Her Majesty already told me. [♂ Boy /♀ Girl], you&#39;re the Master from pan-human history, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> !</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> Do not be so surprised. The outside world...pan-human history,</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> Her Majesty gifted all of us Fairy Knights with that information. —She said to capture you, given the chance.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> Hm...a capture order...it is unusual for Her Majesty.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> Shameless intruders.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> How dare such arrogant garbage set foot in the Fairy Kingdom of Britain.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> Isn&#39;t it proper decorum in your world to extend a reception to guests?</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> Very well, draw your swords! As you wish, I&#39;ll welcome you with open arms!</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> My name is Gawain! One of Britain&#39;s protectors, a Knight of the Fairy Round Table!</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> By this name bestowed upon me by the Queen, I shall annihilate you!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (Consciousness...fading...! )</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (No...I have to push on)</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hang on, Fujimaru...! No good, you&#39;re way too weak...!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That Fairy Knight, the Command Spells, she...she ATE the magical energy!? What kind of sense does that make...!</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> I&#39;ve never tasted resistance like this before...</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> Weak yet not, powerless yet not...hm?</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> What&#39;s that face for, you wretch? It&#39;s not fear or despair. Is that...hate?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Good, you&#39;ve learned to understand that much.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> It&#39;s been a while. I can&#39;t believe we&#39;ve met again, though I had hoped we wouldn&#39;t.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You know her, Artoria...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> —</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> —I don&#39;t know you.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> I wouldn&#39;t remember inconsequential small fry like you. Are you a weed I stepped on somewhere?</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> In any case, try and grow up a little more before speaking to me. You make my neck ache. With a body like yours, you&#39;ll likely never deal with such issues.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Y-you...!</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> Enough joking around. I have no compassion to extend to aggressors.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> You&#39;ll die here with the human, Servants. I won&#39;t waste my time on you all.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> Hm? Is that...a string?</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> It is...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> That is my unrestricted, inexhaustible, and indestructible magical bowstring.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> No matter your persistence, you will never be able to get past it.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> So it would seem...is this the Wing Clan&#39;s magic thread? I&#39;m surprised it&#39;s still around.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> To what end? You&#39;re not saying you&#39;ll beat me with this, are you?</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> No...but it should suffice to restrain you.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Da Vinci. Artoria. I shall hold her off here.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Use this opportunity to get Fujimaru out of the town.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yeah, no problem. Honestly, it&#39;ll be tough, but getting away is our responsibility.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I&#39;ll take Fujimaru on my arm.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Get up, Artoria. Sorry, but I can&#39;t carry you.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Yeah, but—just us?</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Yes. Do not worry about me. It appears that this place is where I must meet my death.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> —</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Why...are you seriously saying that...?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Talking about getting killed so casually...First of all, what do you think you&#39;re doing in a condition like that...!</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Oh? When your opponent is Sir Gawain, you get accustomed to this.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> I have already devised a trump card against him. If all goes well, we shall meet up with each other soon.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> However, I cannot use it while you are all here.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Hurry now, my King...your journey is yet to begin.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> —</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I&#39;m all set, let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> If you&#39;re not up for it, I&#39;m leaving you behind! You understand!?</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> —Let me guess. You are going to sacrifice yourself, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Oh. You think to mention something so obvious?</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> I see, you truly are Sir Gawain. Both your body and mind are as dense as rock.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> Tell me one thing. Is this what a Servant is?</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> A mere puppet that will throw away its own life for the sake of its Master? Not fearing death, nor ever really knowing life?</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Well, I don&#39;t know about that. I think we all want to avoid death, Servant or not.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> No, if anything, my fear of death is even greater now than when I was alive.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Heroic Spirits know what a miracle each summoning is.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> A one-time opportunity. A posthumous dream that is inherently unattainable.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> We are all familiar with the sensation of death. Dark, painful, cruel—sorrowful to the bitter end.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> It is not something that is so easily endured from having tasted it once already.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> As far as life is concerned, death can only be handled once.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Experiencing the pain of your own death over and over—Forcing the grief of your death onto others again and again—</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> I cannot bear it. So, to be honest, I am hoping you will have failed to notice.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> That is your choice. I will only kill your Master.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> If you retreat here, I&#39;ll turn a blind eye to it. Your skill is impressive.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> Even if your Master dies, there are other ways to sustain yourself in the Land of the Fae.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> No. Above all, I shall stop you here, Fairy Knight Gawain.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> For the sake of those who fought beside me in my weakness, and placed their trust in me as a “knight. ”</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> I have no knowledge of your circumstances, nor any interest in your justice.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> I will lay down my life for those I love, and in a manner more ruthless than anyone else.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> Strings all over my body...!? When did you do this!?</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> No, what of it? If you think you can restrain me with human strength—</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> Ggh, nnrgh...! This...how is this even possible!?</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> You&#39;ve strung up the whole city without moving or using magic...!</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> You&#39;re right. What binds you is not sheer force, but restraint through weight.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> What seals you is the very mass of this city itself...that is to say, the accumulation of human technology.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> I grasped your power during the previous battle. Your body will not be able to simply shrug this off.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> —The fingers on my right hand may be shredded.... but I still have my mouth.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Prepare yourself, foreign knight, to receive the full force of my aerial attack!</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> Ah! The weight...of human technology...!</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> I see, you&#39;ll die foolishly after all, Servant!</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> Along with your hubris, having faith in such petty tricks—!</p><p>Note! Scene Change</p><p><strong>Gawain&#39;s Soldier, A:</strong> L-Lord Gawain, are you injured!? The farm is...!</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> It doesn&#39;t matter. I&#39;ll bear the repercussions from Her Majesty. Now, as for the human and Servants that escaped.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> I&#39;m a bit slow on my feet. Assemble the fast ones and give chase.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> You will be able to catch up quickly...they&#39;re not like the man who just fell.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> Surround them and keep them from moving. Don&#39;t kill them until I get there.</p><p><strong>Gawain&#39;s Soldier, A:</strong> Yes! Leave it to us, Lord Gawain!</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> That affected me a little...My body is slightly numb all over.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> I should have asked his name. He was too good a human to simply...defeat.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> Wait...what was that sound?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Uh...what was...that noise?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Sorry, I&#39;ll explain later! We&#39;re being chased by fairies right now!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Can you stand? Or run? Then I&#39;ll let you down. Run as hard as you can!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> You&#39;re fast for someone from the Earth Clan! Ah, da Vinci! They&#39;ve caught up!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Aaah~ ~! And despite the opportunity Tristan gave us!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But we&#39;re out of options. There&#39;s nowhere to hide on these plains.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Eh? What&#39;s that noise?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Alright, made it just in time! Fairy King Oberon, making his appearance to save you all!</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> You know about carriages? Okay, that&#39;s great! Get on, get on! We&#39;ll talk about this later!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Eh...a carriage? That carriage!? The thing only clan heads are allowed to ride in!?</p><p><strong>Horse:</strong> Yes. Tools that exploit animals are forbidden in Britain.</p><p><strong>Horse:</strong> However, there are also fairies that voluntarily enter the working world.</p><p><strong>Horse:</strong> I am the Fairy Horse Red Rab-bit of the Fang Clan, enthralled by the culture known as the “horse-drawn carriages. ”</p><p><strong>G：Red Rabbit:</strong> I serve Lady Aurora, but have neigh&#39;d a special exception for Lord Oberon this time.</p><p><strong>G：Red Rabbit:</strong> I hoof a feeling this is a most fateful encounter, so please enjoy the splendor of my carriage.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> The carriage is a carriage, but the engine is a fairy...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Red...Rabbit...?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> There&#39;s a lot to say here, but nice timing, Oberon!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Everyone, get on! We can shake off the soldiers with this!</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> Nicely prepared. Do we know who owns that carriage?</p><p><strong>Gawain&#39;s Soldier, A:</strong> We do not. There&#39;s a fairy among us who used to build them, but he said:</p><p><strong>Gawain&#39;s Soldier, A:</strong> “It&#39;s a design I&#39;ve never seen before. It was probably built by a clan without Her Majesty&#39;s permission. ”</p><p><strong>Gawain&#39;s Soldier, A:</strong> ...and that&#39;s all he had to say. I apologize for the lack of usefulness...</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> Fine. Recall the men. We&#39;re returning to Camelot.</p><p><strong>Gawain&#39;s Soldier, A:</strong> Is this outcome all right?</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> I don&#39;t have the time to spare chasing rats. No, I take that back. They&#39;re not even rats.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> Britain is the Queen&#39;s garden. It&#39;s not unusual to find a few insects crawling around.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> They just caught my ire this time. The next time we face one another, I&#39;ll crush them for sure.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> Although—I doubt that will be my job.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> There are others more qualified to crush scampering insects.</p><p><strong>Gawain&#39;s Soldier, A:</strong> Ooh, fair Lancelot! Britain&#39;s strongest Fairy Knight!</p><p><strong>Gawain&#39;s Soldier, A:</strong> If she is set on them, she&#39;ll bring them down in the blink of an eye, no matter where in Britain they run!</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> —</p><p><strong>Gawain&#39;s Soldier, B:</strong> (What the hell are you saying, do you have a death wish!? Talking about Lord Lancelot in front of Lord Gawain is...)</p><p><strong>Gawain&#39;s Soldier, A:</strong> Ah! O-Oh, I pray your forgiveness, Lord Gawain! It goes without saying that the strongest of the fairy knights is of course Ga—</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> True, your appraisal of the strongest was correct. Don&#39;t make that mistake again.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> And, not just among the fairy knights. The strongest being in the fairy kingdom.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> We are not even in the same class as her. Keep that in mind.</p><p><strong>Gawain&#39;s Soldier, A:</strong> Y-yes—! I understand!</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> Bring along the confined humans. We&#39;ll process them before we return.</p><p><strong>I：Prisoner:</strong> A-ahh...! Wait, no! It&#39;s not our fault!</p><p><strong>I：Prisoner:</strong> They&#39;re the ones who opened the doors...! I told them I didn&#39;t want to!</p><p><strong>I：Prisoner:</strong> Don&#39;t kill me, don&#39;t kill me...! I&#39;ll never wish for my freedom ever again!</p><p><strong>I：Prisoner:</strong> I still have ten years left in me! Don&#39;t I still have worth as a slave!?</p><p><strong>I：Prisoner:</strong> So please help—Aaaaah!</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> —Don&#39;t be so conceited.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> A human who thought even once of running away has no worth, even as a slave.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> That is the appearance you all deserve. Until you become like slaves once again, I will break you.</p><h2 id="fragment-2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#fragment-2" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Fragment / 2</h2><p><strong>Rob (Older Brother):</strong> The cart&#39;s heavier than usual...</p><p><strong>Rob (Older Brother):</strong> Let&#39;s dump that weapon!

I can do it by myself just fine!</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Get some rest, Annis! We&#39;re almost at Gloucester, and we need to get you properly cleaned up!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The girl who had lost her memory, and the mangy fairy peddlers, Rob, Wag, and Winky.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The odd group headed northward, away from the Nameless Forest.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> There had been a suggestion to sell the girl to a ranch along the way, but Rob hated Woodwose, head of the Fang Clan.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> His stubbornness not to sell such a beauty to such a violent person had landed them in this situation. Way to go, big bro!</p><p><strong>Annis:</strong> Whoa...I can see a city in the distance! What kind of city is that, Winky?</p><p><strong>Winky:</strong> That&#39;s Gloucester, Annis. Isn&#39;t it amazing? It&#39;s a very special city in Britain.</p><p><strong>Winky:</strong> A city of fashion and pleasure. A high-class city run by the Wing Clan head, the beloved Muryan.</p><p><strong>Winky:</strong> As long as you have money, you can get anything you want. Lovers, slaves, fairies, humans, aaaanything.</p><p><strong>Winky:</strong> I don&#39;t like it, though. The only thing that attracts people to that city is whatever forms the latest trend.</p><p><strong>Winky:</strong> Most stuff is gold-plated, but as soon as you bite into it, you&#39;ll know it&#39;s really dirt on the inside.</p><p><strong>Annis:</strong> Is that so?</p><p><strong>Annis:</strong> But that knife of yours, Winky, you bragged about it being made in Gloucester, didn&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Winky:</strong> If it were real, it&#39;d be too valuable to use, wouldn&#39;t it? It&#39;s a fake, so I don&#39;t care if it breaks.</p><p><strong>Annis:</strong> I see. That is very like you, Winky.</p><p><strong>Wag:</strong> You hate Gloucester, Winky? Then why&#39;d you choose this route?</p><p><strong>Wag:</strong> We could&#39;ve gone to Norwich, you know. I mean, the “Calamity” is a scary thought, but still...</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> You can&#39;t use the eastern route this time of year, you idiot. It&#39;s after the rainy season, so Dracae&#39;s territory is larger than usual.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Plus, apparently they haven&#39;t even fixed the bridge over Norwich yet. That&#39;s why Gloucester is the only way.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Oh, no, no, no! I&#39;m going to have to bow my head to that vain Muryan!</p><p><strong>Annis:</strong> Fufu, you two like Muryan, don&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> No, what!? I just told you, I hate her!</p><p><strong>Annis:</strong> I can tell, since you have such a kind face. You&#39;ve even gone a little red.</p><p><strong>Winky:</strong> Huh, goho, goh...?!</p><p><strong>Wag:</strong> Whoa, look, bro! Winky&#39;s so startled, he&#39;s coughing his face off!</p><p><strong>Wag:</strong> What are you so embarrassed about? Is it &#39;cause what she said is true?</p><p><strong>Winky:</strong> Loudmouth. It&#39;s not like that, just shut up.</p><p><strong>Winky:</strong> Ahem. More importantly, did you hear about that fiasco in Camelot?</p><p><strong>Winky:</strong> About 10 days ago, some thug made an attempt on Lady Morgan&#39;s head.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Yeah. I heard he made it all the way to the throne, beating up the soldiers all by himself.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Apparently, neither Lord Gawain nor Lord Tristan could stop him.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> But didn&#39;t Lord Lancelot fly in and stop him?</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> They say the thug was dropped in the Great Pit after a chaotic air battle.</p><p><strong>Wag:</strong> Wow...well, it is Lord Lancelot, after all.</p><p><strong>Annis:</strong> Gawain...Tristan...Lancelot...</p><p><strong>Winky:</strong> Hmm?

They are the Fairy Knights of the Round Table!</p><p><strong>Wag:</strong> Gawain, the most feared Fairy Knight in Britain.</p><p><strong>Wag:</strong> Tristan, the most hated Fairy Knight in Britain.</p><p><strong>Wag:</strong> Lancelot, the most beautiful Fairy Knight in Britain.</p><p><strong>Wag:</strong> With these three fighting off the Mors, we can keep peddling at our leisure.</p><p><strong>Wag:</strong> Well, Lord Tristan wouldn&#39;t bother to protect us.</p><p><strong>Wag:</strong> I&#39;d rather be on edge than a Mors, though! Plus, I wouldn&#39;t want to be anywhere near New Darlington!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The younger brother, Wag, laughed innocently.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Meanwhile, Rob and Winky were nervous that Annis may have remembered something.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> —Then...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> GuRuuuuuuuuu...!</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Aah, it&#39;s a Black Dog!</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Wag, you idiot!

Come at me!</p><p><strong>Annis:</strong> Hah. Haah.</p><p><strong>Annis:</strong> Thank God. My body moved instantaneously, but I managed.</p><p><strong>Annis:</strong> Is everyone okay...?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> With a thud, she bravely stood her shield on the ground, and looked back at the fairies.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> All three of their faces were shocked. Naturally, they had never seen such a dainty knight before!</p><p><strong>Wag:</strong> That—that was amazing! You got rid of the Black Dogs all by yourself, Annis!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Black Dogs are feared in the Fairy Kingdom. They follow the rotten smell of mortal life.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> They&#39;re evil fairies, from the Unseelie Court, unrelated to the six clans, and they appear out of nowhere.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The only kind of villain in Britain to eat fairies!</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Hold on, isn&#39;t it weird, that strength? Could she be the one—</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Are you the Child of Prophecy!?</p><p><strong>Winky:</strong> Huh? Rob, no matter what, that is simply...</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> It&#39;s true, isn&#39;t it? Iron armor, iron shield, and now we&#39;ve seen her power!</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> As good as a Fairy Knight! If that isn&#39;t special, I don&#39;t know what is!</p><p><strong>Wag:</strong> Yes, yes, yes! Annis is the Child of Prophecy! Because she saved us!</p><p><strong>Annis:</strong> ...?

The Child of Prophecy, who will defeat the queen!</p><p><strong>Wag:</strong> The Child of Prophecy, who we&#39;ve been waiting for a long, loooong time, destined to save all the fairies!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Rob, the greedy older brother, and Wag, the obedient younger brother.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> One spoke from self-interest, the other from his heart, eagerly telling the story of the Mirror Clan&#39;s prophecy.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> But, for the girl with no memories, seeing the two of them so very happy,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> seemed like truly a good thing, and so she believed it without question.</p><p><strong>Winky:</strong> Idiots...they don&#39;t get it. If you tell a lie, it&#39;ll become the truth.</p><p><strong>Winky:</strong> If the world believes Annis is the Child of Prophecy, it&#39;s over.</p><p><strong>Winky:</strong> She&#39;ll be snatched up in a heartbeat, by someone much greedier than us.</p><h2 id="section-4-gluocester-i" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4-gluocester-i" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 4: Gluocester (I)</h2><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I see...so Tristan stayed behind at the farm.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> He was an outstanding knight.

To be honest, I&#39;d like to take a break in the autumn woods, but time is money.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> At this rate we can head straight to Gloucester, right? So long, Salisbury.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Of course!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Onward, to Gloucester!</p><hr><p>Note! Scene Change</p><p><strong>Red Rabbit:</strong> Excuse me. Colt I say something first?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Wh-what is it, Mr. Horse? We had a pretty good atmosphere here...</p><p><strong>Red Rabbit:</strong> Yes. I am a proud fairy horse, the most well-bred restive horse in Britain.</p><p><strong>Red Rabbit:</strong> My back is solely for those I acknowledge as my Lord.</p><p><strong>Red Rabbit:</strong> Up to now I have towed you as ordered by my Lady Aurora.</p><p><strong>Red Rabbit:</strong> However, if you are to head to Gloucester—you understand, correct?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> How about a carrot?</p><p><strong>Red Rabbit:</strong> TO BATTLE!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Red Rabbit:</strong> Neeeeeeeeigh! Contract complete!</p><p><strong>Red Rabbit:</strong> Such calm, to be so unfazed by my secret techniques...</p><p><strong>Red Rabbit:</strong> I see that you are a fearless warrior, who has weathered many battles.</p><p><strong>Red Rabbit:</strong> From mare onwards, I am your feet. I shall accompany you as long as the road travels well.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Stuck with a fairy horse like this, doesn&#39;t Aurora seem surprisingly unpopular?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> No, in a way, this is great.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Maybe she&#39;s...too popular...</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> There&#39;s nothing more that has to be said, right? Then let&#39;s get heading to Gloucester.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Setting myself aside, Fujimaru, Artoria, and da Vinci are all worn out.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Drive as safely as you can, please.</p><p><strong>Red Rabbit:</strong> Please, leave it to me. Not once have I ever broken the speed limit.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> By the way Oberon, what&#39;s with those clothes? I liked your cloak from before.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Oh, I use this when I&#39;m asking around for gossip.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> You&#39;ll get questioned by the Queen&#39;s soldiers if you run around asking about the state of the world right now.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> That&#39;s why I keep a low profile, wearing simple traveler&#39;s clothes.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I see, not bad Oberon. Even in something like that you&#39;re seen as “plain. ”</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Oh, are you into fashion, Artoria? Perhaps, you&#39;d like to try dressing like da Vinci?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> N-no, that&#39;s not true...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> If I were to mimic da Vinci, I&#39;d be a laughingstock...</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Mmm, well, you might be right. It&#39;s still a little early for you.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Hey!</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Well, that&#39;s enough messing with Artoria for today.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Fujimaru, da Vinci.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Can you tell me what you learned about the state of affairs in the Fairy Kingdom while I was away?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...and that&#39;s about it.</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Hmm. A series of Calamities. Mors. Fairy lifestyle imitating human society.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> The rebels of Salisbury and the Round Table Army of Londinium.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> And the three Fairy Knights.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Great work. If you know that much, then I only have one thing to share with you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> One more thing...?</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Queen Morgan&#39;s objective.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> She inscribes Command Spells on fairies, draws out their magical energy as a tax, and kills those who can&#39;t bear it.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> The reason she&#39;s imposed such despotism over the past two thousand years isn&#39;t to control this Fairy Kingdom.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Morgan&#39;s true objective is to assault pan-human history in its entirety—to “fairify” the entire planet.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> To expand this Fairy Kingdom, paint over pan-human history, and make Earth a planet of nothing but Britain.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> It&#39;s hard to believe, but it&#39;s the truth.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Queen Morgan is tormenting the fairies for just this reason.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Do you get it? For the sake of both the fairies and the humans, we have to defeat Morgan.</p><p>Note! Scene Change</p><p><strong>Morgan&#39;s Soldiers:</strong> Prostrate yourselves. Offer yourselves up.</p><p><strong>Morgan&#39;s Soldiers:</strong> Worship. Submit.</p><p><strong>Morgan&#39;s Soldiers:</strong> The six clan heads, thirty ambassadors, and one hundred government officials gathered here shall bow their heads.</p><p><strong>Morgan&#39;s Soldiers:</strong> The ruler who expands the borders. The ruler who built the Fairy Kingdom.</p><p><strong>Morgan&#39;s Soldiers:</strong> You are in the presence of Her Majesty Queen Morgan. You hear the mantra of Her Majesty Queen Morgan.</p><p><strong>Morgan:</strong> —The same faces as always, is it? How tedious. How very tedious.</p><p><strong>Morgan:</strong> I will not pardon any of you. I will not save any of you.</p><p><strong>Morgan:</strong> Do not forget. Britain is my property, down to the smallest pebble.</p><p><strong>Morgan:</strong> Know that without my protection, there is no future for the Fairy Kingdom.</p><p><strong>30 ambassadors, 100 officers:</strong> “We understand, Your Majesty. ” “We are but your loyal servants. ”</p><p><strong>30 ambassadors, 100 officers:</strong> “We offer all our time to you. ” “We swear our undying loyalty to you. ”</p><p><strong>Morgan:</strong> —Hmph. Very well. All you clowns, back against the wall.</p><p><strong>Morgan:</strong> I shall allow the clan heads to speak. Each of you may share your opinions.</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong> Ooh, thank you for your generosity, Your Majesty. Then, I shall take the first honor.</p><p><strong>Clerk Yttri:</strong> Head of the Earth Clan. Lord of Norwich, Lord Spriggan, you may speak.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> Yes. According to our observations, the Calamity Pool of Norwich will reach critical mass in about ten days.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> Among those here, are there any lords who have left property in Norwich?</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> If there are, please consult with me later.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> Even as the city is swallowed by waves of Mors, Norwich&#39;s bell tower remains an impenetrable vault.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> It has walls made of Mors-repelling iron, so it would be good to take advantage of this one-time opportunity.</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong> You&#39;re talking about money at a time like this? You seem content with the disappearance of your city.</p><p><strong>Clerk Yttri:</strong> Head of the Fang Clan. Lord of Oxford, Lord Woodwose, you may speak.</p><p><strong>Woodwose:</strong> I give the same advice as always. Your Majesty, please think of building up your army.</p><p><strong>Woodwose:</strong> The Mors increase in number by the year. There are also rebels such as the Round Table Army to deal with.</p><p><strong>Woodwose:</strong> I humbly request that you increase the number of human shipments, and allocate them to the barracks.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> Oh? The Fang Clan alone are not enough for you?</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> It seems even the great Lord Woodwose, once known as the Sword of the Fairy Kingdom, cannot fight the advance of age.</p><p><strong>Woodwose:</strong> Shut up, greenhorn. Don&#39;t flap your disgusting tongue at me. If you weren&#39;t in front of Her Majesty, I&#39;d bite your head off!</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> Now now, please calm down, Woodwose. You are a man of respect among the fairies right now.</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> As the Lord of Oxford,</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> and the owner of a major restaurant franchise that feeds the Fairy Kingdom, you should be more well-mannered. No?</p><p><strong>Woodwose:</strong> M-mrgh...I know, I know, Aurora.</p><p><strong>Woodwose:</strong> I&#39;m no longer a thug on the front lines. I&#39;m a reasonable clan leader.</p><p><strong>I：???:</strong> How boring...</p><p><strong>I：???:</strong> If this is to be a repeat of our usual bantering, may I leave, Your Majesty?</p><p><strong>I：???:</strong> I&#39;m busy prepping for the auction. The item in question is very, very rare this time, you see.</p><p><strong>Clerk Yttri:</strong> Head of the Wing Clan. Lord of Gloucester, Lady Muryan, you may speak.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> I&#39;ve already expressed my opinion.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> The Calamity Pool and “countering the Mors” have nothing to do with my Gloucester.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Between fairies of warped character, there will always be quarreling.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Ah, but Norwich&#39;s products have been superb lately, so I wouldn&#39;t mind providing a little assistance.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Spriggan, give my regards to Count Peperon.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> If he is thinking of moving to Gloucester, please convey to him that he would always be welcome.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> —.</p><p><strong>Clerk Yttri:</strong> Head of the King&#39;s Clan. Lord of Edinburgh, Lady Knocknarea. No statement due to absence.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> —</p><p><strong>Clerk Yttri:</strong> Head of the Mirror Clan. Guardian of the Lake District, Lady Ainsel. No statement due to absence.</p><p><strong>Clerk Yttri:</strong> Next, by special dispensation from Her Majesty Morgan, the Fairy Knight of New Darlington—</p><p><strong>Clerk Yttri:</strong> G-aagh—!?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Are you for real!? A mere clerk speaking my name, what kinda nerve is that?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Hey, Mother, how long until you quit letting the clerks run things?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> At least use better-looking ones.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Like people with their limbs sewn to the wall. Or someone who&#39;s been guillotined.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Mother, aren&#39;t you being a little soft on both the humans and fairies lately? Aren&#39;t they getting enough encouragement?</p><p><strong>Government Officials:</strong> —</p><p><strong>L：???:</strong> Oh? Why so silent? It&#39;s your job to make a bunch of noise, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>L：???:</strong> If you can&#39;t even do that much, then just die. Are you all going to fall prey to my strings here?</p><p><strong>Government Officials:</strong> O—ooh! Fairy knight Tristan! You honor us with your presence!</p><p><strong>Government Officials:</strong> The knight among knights who protects Britain! And more than that—</p><p><strong>Government Officials:</strong> Her Majesty&#39;s grand and beloved daughter! She who alone in Britain, shall inherit Her Majesty&#39;s magecraft!</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Yeah yeah, that&#39;s enough. So you all can do it if you try.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> But there wasn&#39;t that liiiittle twist, was there? It wasn&#39;t pathetic enough.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Sooooo, you and you and you. Why don&#39;t you be a nice little example for the rest, hmm~♡</p><p><strong>Government Officials:</strong> Ha-gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!</p><p><strong>Government Officials:</strong> My foot! My ankle! It&#39;s gone, it&#39;s gone, it&#39;s goooone!</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Kyahahahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Yeah, bounce bounce! Bounce up and down on the severed part! ♡</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Oh, but such bloody violence isn&#39;t allowed here. Whatever happened to your manners?</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Open the window and jump into the great pit. Don&#39;t dirty the floor of the throne room more than you have already.</p><p><strong>Government Officials:</strong> Ah, no, my body, I can&#39;t stop it...! No, no, no no no,</p><p><strong>Government Officials:</strong> If I fall down that hole, I&#39;m done for! Help, somebody help me! Stop that girl!</p><p><strong>Government Officials:</strong> Aaaahhhhhh—!</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> All right, that&#39;s all settled☆</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> What do you think, mother? This is such a boring conference. Isn&#39;t it more fun when it&#39;s this noisy?</p><p><strong>Woodwose:</strong> What the—that was Camelot&#39;s Minister of Justice!</p><p><strong>Woodwose:</strong> Know your place, Tristan, you madwoman! You&#39;re nothing more than a dreg taken in as “daughter”—</p><p><strong>Morgan:</strong> Enough. Be silent, Woodwose. This is a family matter.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Look, Her Majesty is pleased. The only one who should know their place is you.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Too bad, so sad, you stupid puppy♡ Why don&#39;t you retire already? No matter what, we&#39;re stronger than you.</p><p><strong>Woodwose:</strong> Tch, get off your high horse, little girl!</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> Cease, Woodwose. Why do you play along with Tristan&#39;s games?</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> You are the head of the Fang Clan. Don&#39;t ruin our reputation with your petty temper tantrums.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Damn...the ever-uptight Lord Gawain finally makes her appearance, huh?</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> She just saved your life, old man. Next time, your ankles are mine.</p><p><strong>Morgan:</strong> Give your report, Gawain. What occured at the farm south of here?</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> The insurgents calling themselves the Round Table Army were allowed to take control of the farm.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> The guards appointed by the staff of Your Majesty were captured, and the humans in custody attempted to escape.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> Without word from Your Majesty, I departed on my own initiative.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> Despite wiping out the rebels, the facility was destroyed, and we failed to apprehend three of them.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> In addition, the recaptured humans are currently being transported for re-education.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> Please pass down your judgement.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> I will accept any made by you, the ruler of Britain.</p><p><strong>Morgan:</strong> Enough. I shall forgive this disgrace at the southern farm on account of your distinguished service in Sheffield.</p><p><strong>Morgan:</strong> Raise your head, Gawain. That farm was scheduled for demolition at any rate.</p><p><strong>Morgan:</strong> This saves me the trouble of having to mobilize the Earth Clan. Although, it was slightly excessive.</p><p><strong>Morgan:</strong> —Is there anything else you must tell me?</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> Yes...among the three who escaped, there was a human...</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> It was the one Your Majesty spoke of, the Master of pan-human history.</p><p><strong>Ambassadors:</strong> The Master of pan-human history...! Then the words of Beryl Gut were correct after all!</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> There is one more thing.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> The fairy that accompanied the human appeared to be one from the Fairy Kingdom...</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> If I am not mistaken, her appearance is that of a human 16 years of age. A fairy who uses magecraft, the same as Your Majesty.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> —What was that?</p><p><strong>Woodwose:</strong> Gawain. Are you implying that this fairy might be the Child of Prophecy?</p><p><strong>Woodwose:</strong> That&#39;s nothing more than Ainsel&#39;s lies! There is no true ruler of Britain other than Queen Morgan!</p><p><strong>Woodwose:</strong> You put stock in gossip like one of those plebeian fairies! How shameful for a servant of the Queen!</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Shitty mutt. You&#39;re far too loud.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> No no, Lord Tristan! Lord Woodwose&#39;s irritation is understandable.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> To speak of the Child of Prophecy is to speak of the Tintagel affair. Don&#39;t you see? The coastal village that sheltered the Child of Prophecy.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> The one who razed that village was none other than Lord Woodwose. Unfortunately, he failed to capture the child in question.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> The one who broke through the Fang Clan surrounding the village was a blonde girl of about 16 years.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> Among a stormy battle, the soldiers whispered to each other.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> “The girl uses magecraft. ” “The return of the King. ” And even—“Queen Morgan&#39;s daughter. ”</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> How dare you duck? Die, Capless.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Got it? I&#39;m Mother&#39;s only daughter.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> I don&#39;t care about any Child of Prophecy, so keep that shitty rumor to yourself.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> I hold no such opinion. It is idle gossip of the Fang Clan.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> Still, representatives of the upper class, gathered here before the throne of Camelot, what do you think?</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> The continuing increase of Mors, the omen of disaster for Norwich, Knocknarea in the north, Londinium in the south.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> The uprising in Sheffield a few days ago.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> And now the trespasser from the outside world, who Sir Beryl Gut warned us of!</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> I do not place trust in Ainsel&#39;s prophecies either, but the circumstances align far too well.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> The Child of Prophecy is real.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> At the very least, that is what the lower-class fairies unaware of our politics would believe.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> This is not a situation where our clans can squabble with one another. We must not increase the anxiety of the people any further.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> Why don&#39;t we all band together, and settle the issue of the Calamity Pool of Norwich first?</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> I agree. Setting aside the issue of the Child of Prophecy, the Calamity Pool over Norwich cannot be overlooked.</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> Would it be possible to dispatch Her Majesty&#39;s armies to Norwich, for the purpose of targeting the Calamity in the near future?</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> Was not such an appeal made by the Lord of Sheffield, Lord Boggart?</p><p><strong>Woodwose:</strong> Aurora. I understand your feelings, but we can&#39;t send out the soldiers of Camelot.</p><p><strong>Woodwose:</strong> It&#39;s true that if Queen Morgan fully mobilized her forces, the Calamity could be wiped clean away.</p><p><strong>Woodwose:</strong> However, there is a danger of Camelot falling in that time.</p><p><strong>Woodwose:</strong> Knocknarea of the north is keeping a sharp eye out for just such a gap. We can&#39;t leave the castle undermanned.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Mm. The way things are, it&#39;ll be the War of Spring and War of Summer all over again.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> The battle this time will be between Her Majesty and the self-proclaimed queen, Knocknarea.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> It seems like our warpower is only barely better than hers.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> The Spring and Summer Wars...the name in the fairy calendar for the wars between the northern and southern fairies, if I&#39;m not mistaken?</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> The fairies of the north have claimed dominion over Britain for many thousands of years before.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> They&#39;ve been quietly obeying Queen Morgan for the past several hundred years, but to think they&#39;d try to take the throne again...</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> Aah, this is most distressing! We all swore an oath of allegiance to the Queen!</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> This is no time to be preoccupied with Norwich.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> As Lord of Norwich, I am ashamed to say it, but the citizens of Norwich must be abandoned—</p><p><strong>Morgan:</strong> Do not fear. I shall use the Water Mirror on Norwich.</p><p><strong>Morgan:</strong> The Calamity will destroy the greater part of the city, but the bell tower shall remain.</p><p><strong>Morgan:</strong> So long as the fortress remains standing, the job of reconstruction is yours and yours alone, Spriggan.</p><p><strong>Morgan:</strong> Show me once more the prowess that allowed you to snatch control of Norwich from your predecessors.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> If such be your will, Your Majesty. Then, how much is my grant?</p><p><strong>Morgan:</strong> I shall grant you thirty percent of the flotsam in the western vaults.</p><p><strong>Morgan:</strong> It is little more than garbage drifting ashore from pan-human history, but what could be a better reward for you?</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> Ooh, oooh...! How marvelous, my eternal thanks, Your Majesty!</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> But...this does nothing to save the people of Norwich...</p><p><strong>Aurora:</strong> Can you not begin evacuating the citizens now, Spriggan?</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> We have already issued an evacuation order. However, nobody wants to leave the city.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> Attachment to their land or job, a lack of appreciation for the danger, faith in the Child of Prophecy...</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> It could be any mixture of these reasons. Although my own from the Earth Clan should not be so stubborn.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> And even should they be evacuated, where would they go? Your own Salisbury, city of the Wind Clan?</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> You know that the Earth and Wind are at loggerheads. It is a problem even Her Majesty has difficulty with.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> Things rarely work out the way they should. The sacrifice of Norwich is unavoidable—</p><p><strong>???:</strong> As a matter of fact, I disagree on that point. I believe that the poor, displaced refugees can be well taken care of.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Isn&#39;t that right, Lady Spinel? Wouldn&#39;t New Darlington be able to welcome them with open arms?</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> !!! Yes, you&#39;re right, Red Beryl! You&#39;ve been listening to this boring twaddle!</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> Oh no, my sharp-tongued young lady. It&#39;s not boring in the least.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> Haven&#39;t all the normally-bickering clan heads gathered here together to worry about Britain&#39;s future?</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> There&#39;s no show quite as entertaining as this. Well, there&#39;s no other shows in this Fairy Kingdom!</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> Please excuse me, everyone. I&#39;ve suddenly changed my mind.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> Lady Aurora. We shall meet to discuss the details of Salisbury accepting the refugees later.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> It is better than sending them to the National Slaughter Theatre in New Darlington. Let the problems of the Fairy Kingdom be solved by its people.</p><p><strong>Woodwose:</strong> Oxford will accept them as well.</p><p><strong>Woodwose:</strong> The smiths of the Earth Clan who break the rules are a pain, but letting them die helplessly is against my principles.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Gloucester&#39;s neutrality will not change.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> We shall accept not just refugees, but fairies who wish to escape the bonds of their clan.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> Huh? Suddenly you&#39;re all buddy-buddy with each other? Do you all hate me that much?</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> How sad. And yet I&#39;m Her Majesty Morgan&#39;s first ever lover, and the future King of Britain!</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Yeah, Beryl! Hurry up and get married with Mother, get married!</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> It&#39;s so wonderfully twisted that the greatest fairy in Britain will end up wed to a human!</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> And then you&#39;re going to marry me next, right?</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Humans can get married to as many partners as they like, right?</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> Of course, Lady Spinel. But you should give it a little more time.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> No matter how big a crush you have, as soon as they&#39;re in the hands of someone else, it matters no longer—</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> Stuff like that is common in love affairs. You can&#39;t be sure it won&#39;t happen to you too.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> When you see me become the husband of your mother the Queen, that fever of yours might suddenly cool down.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> Be careful about your decision to get married. You might be closer to your soulmate than you know, right?</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Ha, as if! I&#39;m crazy about you!</p><p><strong>Woodwose:</strong> —</p><p><strong>Morgan:</strong> Very well. I have received all your expectations.</p><p><strong>Morgan:</strong> As I have declared, my plan will not change.</p><p><strong>Morgan:</strong> “At the end of 2017 of the Queen&#39;s Calendar, my Fairy Kingdom will become the ruler of this planet. ”</p><p><strong>Morgan:</strong> I shall destroy the wall of light surrounding Britain, and overwrite the evils of the outside world with our own world.</p><p><strong>Morgan:</strong> Only then will you all be freed from the hands of the Calamity, and a new era shall be ushered in.</p><p><strong>Morgan:</strong> I will build a new Fairyland on the Earth&#39;s surface. The death of your clans will lay its foundation.</p><p><strong>B：Fairies:</strong> —By your will. All according to the Queen&#39;s will!</p><p><strong>Morgan:</strong> Hmph. Then I shall hand down my decision.</p><p><strong>Morgan:</strong> Norwich shall remain as it is. There is no need for an evacuation order.</p><p><strong>Morgan:</strong> I consider the Child of Prophecy to be slightly more dangerous. For they pose a direct threat to my throne.</p><p><strong>Morgan:</strong> One more thing. The invader from pan-human history that Beryl Gut speaks of...</p><p><strong>Morgan:</strong> When they are found, I want them captured, not killed. I wish to evaluate them myself.</p><p><strong>Morgan:</strong> If Gawain&#39;s confirmation that the Master is travelling with the Child of Prophecy is true, then that is convenient.</p><p><strong>Morgan:</strong> Woodwose, Spriggan, Muryan, and Aurora.</p><p><strong>Morgan:</strong> Each of you will begin searching with your troops.</p><p><strong>Morgan:</strong> Traitors and invaders. Bring them all before my throne.</p><p><strong>Morgan:</strong> I shall bestow five hundred acres of territory on the clan that achieves this.</p><p><strong>Morgan:</strong> This ends your audience. The clan heads may withdraw.</p><p><strong>Morgan:</strong> I shall grant the Fairy Knights their next task. As before, there shall be no need for you to search for the Child of Prophecy.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> I don&#39;t get it. What use are the clans, Mother?</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> If you want a hunt, then am I not good enough? Lancelot&#39;s just fast.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> I can go anywhere with the Infinity Mirror you gave me, so...</p><p><strong>Morgan:</strong> No need. You shall not lay a hand on the Child of Prophecy.</p><p><strong>Morgan:</strong> This is my decree. Fairy Knight Gawain, I entrust the rest to you.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> By Your Majesty&#39;s command. Try and behave yourself, Tristan.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> Our Queen was strict with you because she was in front of the clan heads.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> No matter how powerful Her Majesty is, she must behave as a queen.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> She cannot speak to you as a daughter. It is your behavior towards Beryl Gut that is the problem in the first place.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> Her Majesty&#39;s daughter becoming intimate with a human man...and the Queen&#39;s lover? Even in jest, what&#39;s gotten into you?</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> Consider Her Majesty&#39;s position, the rumors about you, and your morals as a knight.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Huh? Shut it, who do you think you are, you ogre?</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> It&#39;s hilarious that you, the one who&#39;s been EATING your lovers one after another, would be worried about my reputation!</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> How many new boyfriends have you made this year? You&#39;re pretty slutty for someone with a body like that, you know.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Could you give me some lovemaking tips sometime?</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Well, you discard them right after you&#39;ve taken a bite, so I guess it&#39;s more an appetite than love!</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> You insolent little—</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Oh, just kidding! I know, I know, don&#39;t look at me that way!</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> I know that your love is always the real thing.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Because you&#39;re awkward, Gawain. You&#39;d never two-time or anything like that, would you?</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> “Gawain of many lovers,” “Gluttonous Gawain. ” Aah, how pathetic! The world doesn&#39;t understand at all!</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> You only become lovers with those you truly care about!</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> —</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> I&#39;m returning to the castle. You, too, should wait like a good little girl for orders.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Seriously, what an irritating meeting. I didn&#39;t get to spend time with Mother again, and...</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Woodwose&#39;s stench is the worst. It&#39;s like the stink of a beast mixed with perfume.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Spriggan&#39;s forced laughter is nauseating, and Muryan&#39;s goody two-shoes act is so transparent.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> And that Aurora is the worst of all! I&#39;d tear her to shreds, if only I had a reason!</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> I hope she screws up soon.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> If she was involved somehow with the rebels, I could crush all of Salisbury...</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Are you listening, Beryl!? Huh, he&#39;s gone? He was in front of the mirror just a second ago.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Ah, I see. He&#39;s at the theatre, huh?</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Today, there&#39;s a show on featuring the humans we caught.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Forcing the humans to fight each other, and letting the winner survive...slave swordsmen, was it?</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> At first I thought it was a pain, but it turned out to be fun!</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Especially at the very end! Like, the champion can earn their freedom!</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> How can humans be so hilarious! There&#39;s no way that&#39;s happening, idiots!</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Wait...this is no time for me to be laughing.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Mother did say that...but I can&#39;t stand it...I can&#39;t let this pass...</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Who does this Child of Prophecy think they are anyway? Using magecraft? Morgan&#39;s daughter? Someone other than me?</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> A piece of trash like that, I&#39;ll kill you! Aaaagh, geez, this pisses me off so much!</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Well then☆times like this call for shopping!</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Where&#39;s the newspaper...ah, now let&#39;s see...</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Gloucester&#39;s Knocker Company withdraws...time to switch up the trends...</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Huh, Spriggan&#39;s is going out of business.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Hmm. Spriggan himself aside, I really liked that place...</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Huh? But wait, the one coming next is...</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Just as I thought, it&#39;s the Count&#39;s shop! As expected, Muryan, you always know what&#39;s hot right now!</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> After all, if you&#39;re shopping, Gloucester is the place to be. She said she was preparing for an auction...</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> All right, then. I&#39;ll give you an auction you&#39;ll never forget♡</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Look, look Fujimaru! You can see the city in the distance!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> It took all day, but we finally reached Gloucester!</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Aah, if we&#39;ve made it this far, we shouldn&#39;t have to worry about the Queen&#39;s soldiers chasing us.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Gloucester is the territory of Muryan, of the Wing Clan. Fighting is strictly forbidden here.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> There&#39;s no fighting with the other clans, nor are they completely beholden to Queen Morgan.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> According to Muryan, this is an independent autonomous region, and they&#39;re “only engaged in diplomacy with Her Majesty&#39;s Fairy Kingdom. ”</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Or so she once declared, to all of Britain.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So Morgan&#39;s army can&#39;t attack us here?</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Morgan can&#39;t raise her hand against Gloucester that easily. You see...hey, da Vinci.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Don&#39;t you think the atmosphere is different in this area? Like the density of mana.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yeah, I wanted to confirm that.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Mechanical devices work fine, but the ones powered by magical energy are under-operating.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Could this be because the very characteristics of Mystery in the atmosphere here—the rules of this world are different from elsewhere?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> You got it. Let me tell you a little fairytale.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> This isn&#39;t exclusive to the Fairy Kingdom of Britain, but is shared by pan-human history. You might learn something useful here.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> In pan-human history, there are various types of fae.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Those that have fallen from the rank of a god. A collection of human and animal grudges, and dregs of their souls.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Latent thoughts with nowhere else to go, reborn as empty human gossip.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> These fae arise from human society, and aren&#39;t the genuine article, strictly speaking.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Genuine fae are those that come from the inner sea of the planet, disconnected from human civilization.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Those born in the inner sea of the planet are known in the world of magecraft as “Great Fathers” or “Great Mothers”.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> You can think of them like...something like bunrei of the planet&#39;s soul, or something to that extent.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> They&#39;re on the same scope as divinity who personify nature, but unlike those gods, they&#39;re not clothed in human rules.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Great Fathers and Mothers are pure, transcendent existences.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Fae of these ranks who appear on the surface on a mission from the planet are known in this Lostbelt as “Sub-bells”, or “A-Reis”.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> The fairy who lent King Arthur the holy sword in pan-human history is one of these “Great Mothers”.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Pan-human history Morgan also probably inherited the authority of such a Great Mother.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Well, Morgan&#39;s father was Uther, Britain&#39;s former king, so I guess that makes her a hybrid of both human and fairy.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> King Arthur, on the other hand, is a hybrid of human and dragon.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> The two of them may seem similar, but there are some fundamental differences.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Hmm. Where does that difference lie?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> The difference is in what they protect in the end, is it the &#39;human side&#39; or the &#39;mystical side&#39;?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> King Arthur chose the Britain where humans live, whereas Morgan chose the Britain where “Mystery” lives.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Well, in hindsight, pan-human history proves which was the correct choice.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> If it had remained a place where Mystery ruled, Britain would have departed from the stage of human history.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Sorry, I&#39;m getting off-topic here.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> “A-Reis” are Great Mother-class fae who have come into “a will of their own”,</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> their own truth...the essence of a fairy like that is capable of reshaping the world as they see fit.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> This is the fairy&#39;s territory. The greatest Mystery possessed by powerful fairies.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Furthermore, just by existing, A-Reis increase their number of terminals, called “offspring”.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> These offspring are the “Children of the Forest” or the “Children of the Stone”, and make up the greater majority of the fairies in the fairy kingdom these days.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Compared to an A-Rei, their power is infinitesimal, but offspring are still offspring.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Some of them inherited more A-Rei blood than others. Gloucester&#39;s Muryan is one of those few.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> That&#39;s the reason Gloucester sits in the middle of such a troublesome fairy territory.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Muryan&#39;s mentality is given form here through a rule called “denial of strength”.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Denial of strength...like a reversal of some sort?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> That was fashionable back in the day, but not anymore.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Currently, you can&#39;t bring “acquired strength” into Gloucester.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Anyone and everyone—even Morgan, returns to their level of strength at birth when they enter Gloucester.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Meaning, a city where everyone becomes level 1...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It seems impartial at first glance, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Right. The more rules people make, the more loopholes they introduce to exploit.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Maybe Muryan is an exception to that rule.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Consequently, in Gloucester, nobody can oppose Muryan. Be sure to remember that.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hmm. Is the term “A-Rei” unique to this Lostbelt?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> They sound similar to what we call things like “Elemental” or “True Ancestor”.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> So, are there any other fairies that have inherited the A-Rei&#39;s powers?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The clan heads, for example. Is Aurora within a fairy territory?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> No. Fairies with that kind of power fall outside the clan structure.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> They&#39;re pursued by fairies from their own clan, or perish when they can no longer handle their own territorial rules...</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Yeah. Among the six clan heads, the only ones who can force their territory on others are Muryan and Knocknarea.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Most of the other “territory holders” have perished, and have become wraiths wandering around Britain.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> They&#39;re called the Fairy Deadlords, or Nightcall. Some believe they&#39;re even more terrifying than the fairy knights.</p><p><strong>Red Rabbit:</strong> Everyone, we will soon reach Gloucester.</p><p><strong>Red Rabbit:</strong> As you can see, as a member of the Fang Clan, entering Gloucester would be too difficult for me...</p><p><strong>Red Rabbit:</strong> I shall make camp in this area, so please call me when it is time to leave.</p><p><strong>Red Rabbit:</strong> Is that all right? Please do not misunderstand.</p><p><strong>Red Rabbit:</strong> I may look like this, but I am definitely one of the Fang Clan. Not one of the Wind Clan. This may be surprising.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Sure...seems that way...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I can see that.</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> All right, gang, let&#39;s split up.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Myself with da Vinci, Fujimaru with Artoria.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> The auction&#39;s tonight. You&#39;re free until then.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Any sort of behavior is acceptable in Gloucester. Everyone can make as much of a racket as they want.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> You&#39;ve got the money you earned in Salisbury? You can use it in Gloucester too, so spend it however you want.</p><hr><p>Note: Male Player</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Oh, just think of it as a date and the time will just fly by!</p><hr><p>Note: Female Player</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I heard it&#39;s fun to shop with your girlfriends! Enjoy, Girl&#39;s Holiday!</p><hr><p>Note: Branch End</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Well, da Vinci, is there anywhere you&#39;d like to go?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> The cafe is nice, but I recommend the Distortion Observation Deck. It&#39;s so amazing, you&#39;ll get dizzy and want to throw up!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Wait, you&#39;re already heading there! You just decided on your own!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You two, I know this is sudden, but you&#39;ll be fine, right? Right? Then you do the same as well.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hold on, Oberon! Isn&#39;t there an art museum or something here!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> There&#39;s so many different kinds of fairies in this Lostbelt, shouldn&#39;t there be some sort of “painter fairy” too!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> —</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> —</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...and off they go...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> S-seems so.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> It&#39;s just me and you now, Fujimaru...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...anyway, should we go?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> That was fast!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Oh, ah, I&#39;m sorry...It was just so sudden I lost my composure...deep breaths, deep breaths...</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Well, there&#39;s no point in coming all this way just to hesitate!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> We&#39;re finally in Gloucester, so let&#39;s enjoy ourselves! Let me show you around!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Wow, so this is the city of Gloucester!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Something&#39;s not quite right here!</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> It really is strange, isn&#39;t it? The first time I came here I felt the same way.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Things in the distance appear larger, things that are closer appear smaller...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Sometimes it rains pink, or the main street is covered with rainbows...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Boys turning into girls, girls turning into boys...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Anyway, what&#39;s trendy here changes rapidly. When I came before—when I came I—</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> ...scored a zero...in the princess contest...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> ...stripped of my clothes...by a girl wearing a scarf made of worm silk...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s enough, that&#39;s enough! I don&#39;t need to know more!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I see...I was only just getting started...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Why your clothes!?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> ...what I was wearing was unfashionable...I wonder what she&#39;s doing now...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> ...If she&#39;s doing fine I&#39;ll be devastated...I have to get revenge next time...</p><hr><p><strong>Passing Fairy:</strong> Oh. Haven&#39;t seen you two around. Are you visiting because you heard about today&#39;s auction?</p><p><strong>Passing Fairy:</strong> My. You sure can make a human stand out.</p><p><strong>Passing Fairy:</strong> The current trend in Gloucester is “possessions that make others envious”.</p><p><strong>Passing Fairy:</strong> Going for a plain look while dressing up your human squire to be eye-catching, huh...</p><p><strong>Passing Fairy:</strong> Great idea, I&#39;m going to copy that!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> —</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (Artoria&#39;s making that face again...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (I&#39;m starting to understand...little by little...)</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Sorry. Could you tell us more about the auction?</p><hr><p><strong>Passing Fairy:</strong> You mean, in detail, like, the goods that are being auctioned off? “A fairy with an iron weapon”, right?</p><p><strong>Passing Fairy:</strong> I heard it&#39;s a vile creature from another world that opposes the Queen. .</p><p><strong>Passing Fairy:</strong> If you&#39;re a criminal, there&#39;s no problem with others treating you like a slave. I&#39;d participate in the auction too, but...</p><p><strong>Passing Fairy:</strong> They&#39;re saying you need an invitation this time, so I won&#39;t bother. Instead, I&#39;ll go have some fun at a soiree.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I&#39;m sorry...I just froze up. I was supposed to ask her for information...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s alright, it&#39;s alright. Take it easy.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Yes. I was so nervous. Thanks to you, I was able to relax.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> So, about that invitation we were told about...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> More importantly, about the invitation...</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> We can&#39;t get one. They&#39;re only given to high-ranking fairies.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I can&#39;t say this out loud, but we have no choice but to sneak into the auction venue.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> But don&#39;t worry, infiltration is my magecraft&#39;s specialty!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> All riiight! This time I&#39;m going to show you how cool I am~!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> S-sure.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (What is this feeling of déjà vu...)</p><hr><p><strong>Voices from Afar:</strong> Somebody! Anybody out there!</p><p><strong>Voices from Afar:</strong> Catch them, catch theeem! The breeding rats have escaped from their cages!</p><p><strong>Voices from Afar:</strong> I&#39;ll give you a reward if you catch them! Pleeaaase!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> ...? There&#39;s some kind of small creature coming from over there in droves...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> What do we do, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Let&#39;s catch them!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (This is turning into a really long sidequest chain...! )</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> ...ah, I see, you&#39;re still not used to this...well, it can&#39;t be helped...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> No, I&#39;m just talking to myself. We&#39;re about to get into a fight, so don&#39;t worry about it.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I&#39;m sure you won&#39;t like it, but...Just look at it like another lesson free of charge.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...?</p><hr><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Rats, huh.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> My eyes still sting...</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Big things look small...and small things look big...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Things like this happen in Gloucester. Did you learn something from this?</p><p><strong>Grateful Fairy:</strong> Thanks! You sure like to do some weird things in your free time! Here&#39;s a coupon in appreciation.</p><p><strong>Grateful Fairy:</strong> See ya! I&#39;m gonna make a fortune with these rats!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> We got a coupon. “The Safe and Amazing Knocker Company...”</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Wait, this is from S&amp;C! You know, Spriggan &amp; Capless!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> The first comprehensive department store in the kingdom, built 100 years ago! The old man told me about it!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> And, according to the map, we&#39;re close! Let&#39;s go, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> ......</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Looks like they&#39;re going out of business...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That fairy from before...</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> There&#39;s already a new store being built...the brand is “Count”...I&#39;ve never heard of them, but...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> The shoes, bags, the hat, that dress...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Wow, the stuff on display in the window is all so coooool!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> It&#39;s so cute and sparkly, yet so elegant and fun to wear!</p><hr><p>Note: Male Player</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I waaaant them! Oh, now that I think about it, they&#39;d be wasted on me!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> They look like womens&#39; designs, but this is probably something different!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> This is unusual...“Japanese clothing”? I think they would look good on you, Fujimaru!</p><hr><p>Note: Female Player</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> You&#39;d also look great in those boots over there!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> They&#39;re such a brilliant blue!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> So clean and gentle, yet so crisp and clear!</p><hr><p>Note: Branch End</p><p><strong>Red-haired Fairy:</strong> I know what you mean. You&#39;ve got a pretty good sense of style.</p><p><strong>Red-haired Fairy:</strong> But could you pipe down a bit?</p><p><strong>Red-haired Fairy:</strong> I&#39;d rather not stand out. I came here in secret.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I-I&#39;m sorry...I was born in a small village, so I just...</p><p><strong>Red-haired Fairy:</strong> Ah, I see. What, with your village about to be hit by the Calamity, you escaped to the city before you died?</p><p><strong>Red-haired Fairy:</strong> You&#39;re lucky. You&#39;re not just another cocky Gloucester fairy.</p><p><strong>Red-haired Fairy:</strong> And your ankles aren&#39;t to my taste. Be thankful you&#39;ve got such awful boots.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I-Is that so? .... they&#39;re unfashionable, huh? I see...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> They&#39;re practical though...you&#39;d be fine if you got bitten by an Awd Goggie...</p><p><strong>Red-haired Fairy:</strong> Pfft. What kind of country bumpkin story is that, being bitten by a Goggie!</p><p><strong>Red-haired Fairy:</strong> Judging by your looks, you&#39;re with the Wind Clan, right? And not bad-looking even by their standards.</p><p><strong>Red-haired Fairy:</strong> Yet you&#39;re working in a field despite that? Well, there aren&#39;t many slaves on the frontiers—</p><p><strong>Red-haired Fairy:</strong> At least—</p><p><strong>Red-haired Fairy:</strong> ...Strange. Too strange. Isn&#39;t this conversation a little weird?</p><p><strong>Red-haired Fairy:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (She&#39;s eyeing me up and down...! )</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (This is bad, she&#39;s getting suspicious...! )</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I-i-it&#39;s not that strange, is it?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Fujimaru and I, we&#39;re just not used to city fairies yet....</p><p><strong>Red-haired Fairy:</strong> ...not used to it yet, huh...I see, that&#39;s why you&#39;re not scared when you see me.</p><p><strong>Red-haired Fairy:</strong> ...but what is it? It&#39;s not just that...</p><p><strong>Red-haired Fairy:</strong> (Why am I not irritated...? I hate all fairies, and yet...)</p><p><strong>Red-haired Fairy:</strong> ...well, I guess it&#39;s an off day for me. I&#39;m headed to the auction later today.</p><p><strong>Red-haired Fairy:</strong> Oh, you&#39;re interested in the auction? But, do you have an invitation?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Uh...yeah.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Actually, we came all the way here for the auction...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> But we didn&#39;t know you needed an invitation to get into the venue, so...</p><p><strong>Red-haired Fairy:</strong> Is that so. Invitations...</p><p><strong>Red-haired Fairy:</strong> Hehe. I have some left over, but I&#39;m not sharing~.</p><p><strong>Red-haired Fairy:</strong> I&#39;d rather feed them to the goats than give them to you!</p><p><strong>Red-haired Fairy:</strong> Yeah, yeah, those faces suit you! Know your places, bumpkins!</p><p><strong>Red-haired Fairy:</strong> You got it? Kids like you are a hundred years too young to be taking part in an auction.</p><p><strong>Red-haired Fairy:</strong> Try again when you&#39;re a little more grown up. Ahh, but—</p><p><strong>Red-haired Fairy:</strong> Low-class fairies don&#39;t even last a hundred years, do they? Why don&#39;t you crawl on your hands and knees in the dirt for the rest of your sorry lives?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> — (dumbfounded)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...what an uncanny fairy...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> ...wasn&#39;t she? I must have said something she didn&#39;t like...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I don&#39;t know...there was something off...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Did we just become friends in some strange way?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> W-well, maybe. I didn&#39;t get a bad impression just now, so...</p><hr><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Oh, the invitation? Naturally, I already got my hands on one. What about it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;d expect nothing less, Oberon.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Guess we&#39;ll use Artoria&#39;s grand magecraft some other time.</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> —</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Unfortunately, we couldn&#39;t prepare any formal attire. Well, Oberon is already pretty flashy,</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> and we&#39;re his friends, so...I guess they&#39;ll let us in.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Of course. Muryan and I have a bit of a thing going. We&#39;ll be able to get into the VIP section.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> The real problem will be when the auction begins. Mash is the main lot, so she won&#39;t be brought out until the end.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I&#39;ve got 70 million morpounds on me. It&#39;s counterfeit, but so long as they don&#39;t figure that out tonight, it won&#39;t be a problem.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> The question is, if we&#39;re able to compete with the other bidders.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I can&#39;t afford to lose more money, but this time the product is what it is...</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> This is gonna be rough...If we&#39;re unlucky, I might have to remortgage the entire Welsh forest...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Seventy million is enough to buy an entire estate, with a full suite of servants, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> If even THAT isn&#39;t enough, than what the heck are they advertising this fairy as?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Well, try and keep your hats on when you hear this: “A fairy armed with iron weapons, a traveller from another world. ”</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> And—“The new Child of Prophecy. ”</p><p>Note! Scene Change</p><p><strong>Auctioneer Fairy:</strong> Ladies and gentlemen who have gathered here.</p><p><strong>Auctioneer Fairy:</strong> I bid you all welcome to Gloucester&#39;s auction house.</p><p><strong>Auctioneer Fairy:</strong> From the dreams of tomorrow, to the dreams of today. From pride in one&#39;s clan, to pride in oneself.</p><p><strong>Auctioneer Fairy:</strong> In order to meet your desires, we have prepared a variety of items for you tonight.</p><p><strong>Auctioneer Fairy:</strong> Have you all sampled the catalog yet? Here it is! Have you found an item that catches your attention?</p><p><strong>Auctioneer Fairy:</strong> Magnificient. Everyone appears to be completely absorbed. This concludes the opening remarks.</p><p><strong>Auctioneer Fairy:</strong> Well then—Please enjoy Lady Muryan&#39;s exhibition to your heart&#39;s content!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> (The auction is starting...! I see, you have to announce your bid directly...)</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> (Usually, the buyer signals secretly, and the one who bids on the item is generally their agent. )</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> (I guess this auction doesn&#39;t recognize agents. You have to bid with your own voice to the bitter end, huh? )</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Huh? What is it, Oberon?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Are you getting restless?</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> (You see lot number 3 in the catalog? “Shakespeare&#39;s Dead Manuscript. ”)</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> (It might be flotsam washed ashore from pan-human history in the exchange the changeling...)</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> (Now I&#39;m interested...I can afford to spend just a little...no, now I have to...alright, here comes my bid...! )</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> (Oh no you don&#39;t! We&#39;re here for lot 9, the “Child of Prophecy! ” And, if you bid on something now, they&#39;ll know the money is fake by the time they bring her out! )</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> (Patience, patience! I mean, if you&#39;re an artist too, then one of my works should be enough! )</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> (Wait, seriously!? I thought I&#39;d look too much like a fanboy if I ever asked, but you&#39;d really do it?! )</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> (Promise, da Vinci! Make it a portrait of me, please! )</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (He&#39;s having a little bit too much fun...)</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> (...I guess he&#39;s used to this sort of thing. I was nervous, but thanks to him, it&#39;s not so bad anymore. )</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> (...We should keep a low profile until the end. It&#39;ll be bad if we stand out too much. )</p><p><strong>Auctioneer Fairy:</strong> And now, the last lot of the day.</p><p><strong>Auctioneer Fairy:</strong> We finally come to what you have all been waiting for. The accursed traitor and threat to our Queen,</p><p><strong>Auctioneer Fairy:</strong> the victorious child, foretold to save Britain by the honorable Lady Ainsel herself!</p><p><strong>Auctioneer Fairy:</strong> Attacking Camelot wielding a never-before-seen iron weapon,</p><p><strong>Auctioneer Fairy:</strong> the brave hero who escaped certain death in the Great Pit, and who returned alive from the Nameless Forest!</p><p><strong>Auctioneer Fairy:</strong> Is the prophecy actually true? Ascertain that with your own eyes, ladies and gentlemen!</p><p><strong>Auctioneer Fairy:</strong> Lot number, Final! I give to you, the “Child of Prophecy”!</p><p><strong>E：Child of Prophecy? :</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Huh?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Whaaaaaaat!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> —Old maaaaaaaan!?</p><hr><p><strong>E：Muramasa of Prophecy:</strong> Well, I&#39;m SORRY for bein&#39; a geezer!</p><p><strong>E：Muramasa of Prophecy:</strong> Wait, who the hell called me that just now!?</p><p><strong>S：Auctioneer Fairy:</strong> Everyone, if you could please calm down!</p><p><strong>S：Auctioneer Fairy:</strong> This man may have a very foul mouth and attitude, but his magical energy is considerable!</p><p><strong>S：Auctioneer Fairy:</strong> He can produce marvelous items, beyond even the skill of the smiths of Norwich.</p><p><strong>S：Auctioneer Fairy:</strong> It is said the Child of Prophecy was the student of a master craftsman.</p><p><strong>S：Auctioneer Fairy:</strong> Lady Muryan gave her approval, saying “Isn&#39;t he at least 20%, no, 30% of the Child of Prophecy? ”</p><p><strong>E：Muramasa, 30% Child of Prophecy:</strong> Shut up. I told you a thousand times, I ain&#39;t no “Child of Prophecy”!</p><p><strong>E：Muramasa, 30% Child of Prophecy:</strong> I&#39;m Senji Muramasa, a lone wolf Servant! Now let me out of this goddamn cage!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I can&#39;t even comprehend this, but that&#39;s Muramasa! Senji Muramasa, one of the Alien God&#39;s apostles!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> What is he doing in Britain!? No, wait, why is he up for auction!?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> You know him!? Then, that person isn&#39;t Mash!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yeah. He&#39;s definitely not Mash...but...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> He&#39;s not enough of a stranger to just ignore!</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> —a Servant. So he&#39;s a Servant too, huh? Well then—</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> The fairies here don&#39;t know what Servants are. They can&#39;t tell the difference between Servants and fairies.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> “Comes from the outside world. ” “Armed with iron weapons. ” “A traitor who opposes the Queen. ”</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> How could that not be the Child of Prophecy!? But this all just feels like a scam!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> What are we gonna do!? The bidding&#39;s already begun!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Of course, we&#39;re gonna save him!</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Got it, leave it to me! Good thing the folks around us are all “what, were you expecting someone different? ”</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Seventy million is enough to compete in this atmosphere. Let&#39;s test the waters with a 1 million opener!</p><p><strong>Auctioneer Fairy:</strong> We start the bidding at 1 million morpounds! Two million! Three million! Four million! Four and a half million! ...Five million!</p><p><strong>Auctioneer Fairy:</strong> Lady Artoria and her entourage bid five million morpounds! Are there any other bids?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> (Why drop my name like that!? )</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> (It&#39;s more exciting this way, right? “The Child of Prophecy, bought personally by none other than the Child of Prophecy...”)</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> (A hilarious twist of fate like that will definitely go down in the history of Gloucester! )</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> (OBEROOOOOONNNNN!!! )</p><p><strong>Auctioneer Fairy:</strong> Five million, five million morpounds, going once, going twi—We have another bid! Ten million! Ten million! The bidding is heating up!</p><p><strong>Auctioneer Fairy:</strong> Ten million, ten million, do we have any other interested parties!?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> (Damn. This is bad. Stop, stop! Seriously, we&#39;ve got to fold here! )</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Twenty million! Twenty million morpounds! Aaah, what a pain! Seventy million! How do you like me now, HUH!?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> (Artoria! Are you actually some kind of wild animal!? )</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yeah, she gets like that sometimes.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> She might have gone a bit overboard this time.</p><hr><p><strong>Auctioneer Fairy:</strong> Seventy million! Seventy million morpounds! We have a winner, sold to—</p><p><strong>The Other Bidder:</strong> —One hundred million morpounds.</p><p><strong>The Other Bidder:</strong> I don&#39;t know what sort of nouveau riche clan you come from, but you should know your place.</p><p><strong>The Other Bidder:</strong> If I&#39;m outbid by someone like you, it&#39;ll be the end of Britain.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> There&#39;s no way we&#39;re losing here! Then...then—</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> One hundred and one million morpounds, putting Oberon&#39;s land down as collateral—!!!</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> (Have you gone insane!? My land isn&#39;t worth even ten million! )</p><p><strong>Auctioneer Fairy:</strong> Ooh...ooh...this auction has fallen out of my control.</p><p><strong>Auctioneer Fairy:</strong> Lady Muryan, please deliver us your verdict!</p><p><strong>Auctioneer Fairy:</strong> Which one of these buyers is actually going to be able to pay!?</p><p><strong>N：Voice from the Stage:</strong> Very well. The auctioneer will stand down, please.</p><p><strong>N：Voice from the Stage:</strong> Because the judgement has become such a difficult matter, I, Muryan, will take over from here.</p><p><strong>N：Muryan:</strong> The item up for auction is the Child of Prophecy, regardless of whether or not it&#39;s the genuine article.</p><p><strong>N：Muryan:</strong> The one who buys it must have not only capital, but also sufficient dignity.</p><p><strong>N：Muryan:</strong> Will the two remaining bidders please come up to the stage?</p><p><strong>The Other Bidder:</strong> Hah, so true. I like the way you think, Muryan.</p><p><strong>The Other Bidder:</strong> When it comes to grace, I can&#39;t possibly lose. This&#39;ll be a public execution of some upstart new-money clan.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Wah, inviting them up to the stage!? How is this even still an auction!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Oberon, is this also one of Gloucester&#39;s quirks!?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Nope, I&#39;ve never seen this before either. Damn it, Muryan...what are you up to?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Artoria, take your seat and calm down. This is some kind of trap.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Once you get onstage, this is going to turn out very badl—why is her seat empty?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Too little, too late, Oberon.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Artoria&#39;s already taken Fujimaru&#39;s hand and gone up to the stage.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> You&#39;re acting on the first thing that pops up in your head, girl!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Before I knew it, I was brought up on stage.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What have I done to deserve this?</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Please fight by my side! I&#39;m hopeless all by myself!</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Then, would you be so kind as to introduce yourself, Lady Spinel?</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Or should I refer to you as Lady Tristan, the Fairy Knight?</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Sure. I have no problem with that name.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Daughter of Queen Morgan, and the expression of blood. The fairy clad in the most gorgeous of dresses.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Fairy Knight Tristan. Daughter of the Queen, who will one day come to own all of Britain.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> —your turn now, sweetheart. Why don&#39;t you share your shabby name with us?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> (What do we do, Fujimaru! She&#39;s the fairy from earlier today...! )</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> (She was actually one of the Fairy Knights...and Morgan&#39;s daughter on top of that!? What kind of sick plot twist is this?! )</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Ah, as I expected, no introduction.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Well, it&#39;s no wonder. There&#39;s no fairy with greater pedigree than me, after all.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> You were all talk, but in the end—...hey, you&#39;re...the ones from earlier today...</p><p><strong>C：Muryan:</strong> Allow me to introduce them.</p><p><strong>C：Muryan:</strong> This girl is a fairy from Tintagel, and will be turning 16 this year.</p><p><strong>C：Muryan:</strong> The miracle child who escaped Woodwose&#39;s siege, and taught herself magecraft just like Her Majesty.</p><p><strong>C：Muryan:</strong> Ladies and gentlemen, please take a good look. The staff in her hands is the Staff of Selection.</p><p><strong>C：Muryan:</strong> Her name is Artoria. The true Child of Prophecy.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> And the servant standing beside her is a traveller from another world.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> The traveling star said to guide the Child of Prophecy. One of the lights that will save Britain.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> A Master from pan-human history, a human named Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Wh—They don&#39;t just know about me, they know about Fujimaru too!</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Please do not get violent, Lady Tristan. The bidding has not ended yet.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Once you two step onto the auction stage, you are obligated to bid on the item.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> However...how troublesome...the Fairy Knight, Lady Tristan, and the Child of Prophecy, Lady Artoria...</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Your worth has been assessed as roughly equal.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Competition between wealth and dignity is no longer possible.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Me, the same as her!? Have your eyes turned rotten!?</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> I&#39;m better in every single way! She can&#39;t compete with me in either strength or beauty!</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> So you say. What do you think, our guest from another world?</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> In your eyes, who has more merit, Tristan or Artoria?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Artoria.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> I&#39;ll kill you, you son of a bitch!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Tristan.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Shaddup! I think so too, but you don&#39;t have to say that, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> This isn&#39;t about merit anymore. It&#39;s a battle of the soul!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Girl–the only thing that comes out of your mouth is boonies this, hicks that, is that all you can say!?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Maybe take a good look at your own upbringing first, stupid IDIOT!</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Wh—What did you just say...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Then, what of magecraft?</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Both of you are practitioners of magecraft, considered “useless” in Britain.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Magecraft on its own has little value, however the fairies who practice it are few and far between.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> The “Child of the Queen” and the “Child of Prophecy. ”</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> If both possess equal worth, why not determine superiority by use of magecraft?</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> After all, for you two, that is what is truly valuable.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Isn&#39;t your attitude towards magecraft the one thing you won&#39;t lie about?</p><p><strong>Artoria &amp; Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> —</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Fine. So I just have to kill this little shit with magecraft?</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> All right, I&#39;m in. You&#39;re just going to screw up anyway, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> —Hmph.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> If you&#39;re the Queen&#39;s daughter, then I bet you&#39;ve been living life cooped up in a grand castle, sheltered away from any slight discomfort!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> There&#39;s no way I&#39;d ever lose to someone like that! Who cares if you&#39;re a Fairy Knight!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Don&#39;t underestimate the guts of a country girl! I ate my vegetables every day for sixteen years!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> That doesn&#39;t count, I need a do-over! I wasn&#39;t ready yet!</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> I can do magecraft as much as I want back at the castle! This isn&#39;t my true strength!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Magecraft is built on steady preparation.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Even if you don&#39;t have any magic items on hand, there are heaps of things in the venue here that can be used as substitutes.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> (Like this extremely flammable carpet, or that lamp I could turn into a bomb with magical energy. )</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> And yet, now that you&#39;re out of tools, you&#39;re too clumsy to do anything about it.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Now listen up, you got it?!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> You&#39;re a hundred years too young for magecraft, so go back to school and start from scratch!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> (Yesss, I did it–! )</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> You can&#39;t talk to me that way, you goddamn brat—!</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> That&#39;s enough. The victor is decided. The one superior in magecraft is Lady Artoria.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Therefore, the false Child of Prophecy will be purchased by her.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> That concludes tonight&#39;s auction. Everybody, please be safe on your return trip.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> It&#39;d be best if you&#39;d return as well, Lady Tristan.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> If I recall...aren&#39;t you in the middle of a period of house arrest in New Darlington?</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> If rumors begin to circulate that you were in Gloucester tonight, would Her Majesty not be displeased with you?</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Tch...! So you&#39;re taking the Child of Prophecy&#39;s side, are you, Muryan!?</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Not at all. I am merely showing deference to Her Majesty, who bestowed the position of Fairy Knight on you.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> The venue can always be cleaned, but upholding the Queen&#39;s dignity is most important.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> There are some fairies who grow tired of your selfishness, and may begin to lose their faith in the Queen.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> You know well how mercurial fairies can be, don&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> From my position, I&#39;d rather Knocknarea not get any more supporters in the north.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> —. —fine, I get it. I&#39;m leaving.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> See you soon in Camelot, Muryan?</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> As someone with the same taste in art, I&#39;d love to show you my collection.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Ah—hahahaha~ ~!!!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I was so nervous...! I thought she would kill us all!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> That&#39;s amazing. It really felt like she would, but then that girl really won against Lady Tristan!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> We have the same build, and roughly the same amount of magical energy,</p><p><strong>???:</strong> and yet she&#39;s got such an amazing air about her...just wow, so cool!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Phew...guess we made it through somehow.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Aha...hahaha...my legs are starting to shake...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Do you hear something coming from backstage?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Sorry, I&#39;m trembling all over, and there&#39;s a ringing in my ears...</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> But I couldn&#39;t just let it slide. She&#39;s a fairy dozens of times stronger than I am, and yet...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> She acts like that despite having the same name as Tristan, so I just got so angry...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yeah, I didn&#39;t expect we&#39;d catch the attention of a second Fairy Knight so quickly.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But Artoria won the magecraft showdown! Now that that&#39;s over with, the only problem left is—</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Oh, everything&#39;s fine and dandy now that the cage is gone. What kind of trick is that?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> And now Muramasa&#39;s out of the cage.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Artoria, Oberon, I haven&#39;t explained this to you yet, but...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> He may be a Heroic Spirit from the “outside world”, but he&#39;s not exactly a friend of ours.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> He&#39;s an apostle of the Alien God. A Servant of a force hostile to pan-human history.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Fujimaru&#39;s enemy, huh? But didn&#39;t you call him “old man” earlier?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Well, he is an old man...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It&#39;s a bit of a long story...</p><hr><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Don&#39;t bother explaining. We&#39;ve just had a bit of a connection up &#39;til now.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> We&#39;re not out to kill each other...but we ain&#39;t exactly friends either.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> To put it bluntly, we&#39;ve got a troubled relationship. Wouldn&#39;t you say, Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> If you want to fight, I&#39;ll fight. If not, then that&#39;s that.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> I&#39;ll even make tea to pass the time. It&#39;s just the way things go when you bump into someone.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> More importantly, little girl. That staff, and that figure—</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> —</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> That was quite the show you put on! You even got the last pose right!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> A true master of your craft! British magi sure are something!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> S—sure. Uh, thanks.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> (Fujimaru, Fujimaru...! )</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> (What&#39;s with this man!? )</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> (He looks so young, but he&#39;s an old man on the inside! He has a very bad air to him, but he isn&#39;t hostile at all! )</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Alright, hold it right there, Senji Muramasa. The fact remains that you&#39;re still a threat to us.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> And on top of that, I just have to know. How in the heck did you get here?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> ...Well, I&#39;d rather not say.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> But, I guess I owe you now. All right, I&#39;ll make this brief.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> After you all left Olympus, I got orders from the Alien God.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> “Go to the British Lostbelt and deal with the Lostbelt King. ”</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> It said that Britain&#39;s growth was “outside the plan”.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> That bastard Rasputin was occupied elsewhere, and we couldn&#39;t get in contact with Limbo.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> That being the case, I came here on my own, and broke into the castle at the center of the island.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Took even the Fairy Knights by surprise. I could&#39;ve easily made it all the way to the throne, but...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Just as I was about to lop off the Queen&#39;s head, some crazy thing flew out of the sky.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Next thing I knew, it blew me off the throne.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> We crossed swords a bunch of times in the air, but I got dropped down the pit without getting a good hit in.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Took a little less than ten seconds to be dumped down there. How many times was my Spiritual Core hit in that timeframe?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> A normal Servant would have died, what, twelve times over?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Too bad I&#39;m a blasphemous creation tempered by the Alien God.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> As long as I narrowly escape death, I just have to keep opening my eyes.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Took me about three days to get to the point I could move enough to crawl up and out of the hole.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> I&#39;d run out of steam, so I stayed in a village as a master smith for about three days.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Wasted three more days collapsed on the road after I wandered into that weird forest.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> And then I got captured by a bunch of rowdy fairies, which wasted three more days.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> I&#39;ve spent the last five days stuck in this crazy town, forced to talk and show off my skills.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> And that&#39;s all there is to it. It&#39;s a pretty pitiful story, but nothing worth writing home about.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Isn&#39;t the fact that you made it all the way to Morgan&#39;s throne amazing enough!?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> No warrior has ever made it that far in all the Queen&#39;s Calendar!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> ...Is that so?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> On top of that, you have experience as a blacksmith! The catalogue said you can make anything!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> ...I guess?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> But you&#39;re an evil Servant...so I guess we have to kill you right now, just to be sure...!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> ...Hey now.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Good Servants, evil Servants...What matters is what you&#39;ve done up to the present.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Servants are like mercenaries, you know. The important thing is who their current contract is with, and what they do from then on.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> ...who are you? From the looks of it, you&#39;re a Servant.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I&#39;m Oberon. A pan-human history Servant summoned to Britain one step ahead of you.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Senji Muramasa, huh? From the looks of it, you&#39;re after Queen Morgan.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Then it looks like we all want the same thing. How about that? Yesterday&#39;s enemy is today&#39;s ally, or so they say.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Let&#39;s work together until Morgan&#39;s defeated. Don&#39;t you think it would be better to present a united front?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> ...I guess so. Not like I can expect any reinforcements here.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Seems like your proposal is a bit of a godsend to me.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...hmm. What do you think Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> He may be an apostle, but he&#39;s a reasonable one.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> This Alter Ego Muramasa isn&#39;t the same one that saved our lives in Shimousa, but...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> His nature and disposition should be the same. Once he makes a promise, he won&#39;t work against it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...I&#39;m hopeful, but...what about you, Artoria?</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Eh? He&#39;s coming with us?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Then in that case, welcome aboard! There&#39;s no such thing as an evil blacksmith!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Uuh, leaving Artoria&#39;s mysterious opinions about smiths aside,</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> are you sure about this, Muramasa? The Alien God is hostile towards us.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Isn&#39;t this a betrayal? Are you gonna blow up out of nowhere?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Of course not. What&#39;s going through your head?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> This ain&#39;t any kind of betrayal.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> I&#39;m just a swordsmith contracted to work for the Alien God. There&#39;s no loyalty involved.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> If you want to talk about moral obligations, then that&#39;s firmly on the side of you guys.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> You saved me, so I&#39;m returning the favor. The Child of Prophecy, huh? I keep hearing about you.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> I&#39;ll stick with you guys until the Queen is taken down. That doesn&#39;t conflict with my contract with the Alien God.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Muramasa joined the party!</p><hr><p><strong>Auctioneer Fairy:</strong> Ahem. It appears you have much to discuss, so would you mind proceeding?</p><p><strong>Auctioneer Fairy:</strong> Thank you very much for your patronage.</p><p><strong>Auctioneer Fairy:</strong> In accordance with this, the manager would very much like to meet you all and receive your payment.</p><p><strong>Auctioneer Fairy:</strong> Please, proceed to the lord&#39;s manor. The Lord of Gloucester, Lady Muryan, is waiting for you.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Nice to meet you, Artoria! And everyone from pan-human history, as well!</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> That was quite some battle you had! Thanks to you, the great fashion trend of tomorrow has been decided～☆</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> It goes as follows,</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> “Daily DIY necessities that can be quite convenient! Simple! Worth trying! Magical items that bring you good luck! ”</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Fufufu. This is going to be the most drab fashion trend Gloucester has ever seen!</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Ah. Did I say something strange?</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Hmph. Well, it&#39;s not impossible that you would be stricken with nerves when I, the charismatic producer of the Fairy Kingdom,</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> would summon you, a bunch of no-name fairies and humans with no money and no power to speak of.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> So I thought I&#39;d go out and meet you with an uppity attitude and gain some more popularity all at once...</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> I guess you shouldn&#39;t do things outside of your comfort zone...still, first impressions are important, so...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;re...Muryan?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (...She reminds me of a certain devilish kouhai...BB...)</p><hr><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Yep. No need for lengthy introductions, right? I&#39;m Muryan. At your service.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Sigh...finally, you&#39;re back to your normal self. I almost thought you were an impostor there for a second, Muryan.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> What was that all about? Are you gonna turn yourself into a Mors next?</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> There&#39;s no need for such discourtesy, Oberon. I&#39;m an eternally-perfect lady.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> That was nothing more than a freebie.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> I&#39;d been looking forward to meeting someone from pan-human history, aside from Beryl Gut.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> These Fairy Eyes of mine may have declined, but I can still see some “color. ”</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Fujimaru, right? Just as I thought, a fine young [♂ man /♀ woman]!</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> If every human from the outside world was like Beryl, I&#39;d be killing them all in a fit of rage,</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> so I&#39;m glad there&#39;s a decent look about you. It gives me a little bit of hope.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You&#39;re most kind. I&#39;m still a little bit baffled by this hospitality, though.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Despite knowing all about pan-human history, you&#39;re welcoming us with open arms...is that right?</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Don&#39;t get the wrong idea, pan-human history isn&#39;t my enemy!</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Excuse me, that was a mistake. I don&#39;t have any enmity towards pan-human history, rather.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> The one who I am on guard against is you, the organization called Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> I heard that you have crossed many other worlds before now.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> I will need to determine your intentions in this Fairy Kingdom.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> ...well, I heard the gist of it from Muramasa, so my assessment is as good as done.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Muramasa? Did you tell her about us?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Now now, I never dreamed I&#39;d end up working with you lot.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> I couldn&#39;t stand Muryan&#39;s interrogation, so I let slip a few things about Olympus.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> It wasn&#39;t an interrogation, more like a...fun tea party.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Still...the Alien God...Fantasy Trees...Crypters and Alter Egos...</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> I heard so many very, very interesting things, that I may have gone a little overboard with excitement.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Just a little?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> From what I heard, the Wing Clan are the most gentle of the fairies. Was that complete bunk?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Yeah, it&#39;s true that they were.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> The mild-mannered Wing Clan is no more. Because...</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Oberon.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Whoops, my bad. I&#39;ll shut up now. Please continue, o korpokkur princess.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> It was Muramasa who was out of line. It was not your error, Oberon.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> ...Fujimaru. There is one thing I wish to confirm.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> You have no intention of turning against this Lostbelt, correct?</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Your business is only with Her Highness Morgan, who made the foolish decision to attack Olympus.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Can you assure me, that Chaldea has no mind to turn on Britain itself?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I can&#39;t confirm that yet.</p><hr><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> ...I see. You won&#39;t say, but you remain prudent.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Who is your enemy and what do they want? That is what you&#39;re still trying to figure out.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> You&#39;ve yet to even meet Her Majesty. You can&#39;t give an answer so easily.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Very well.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Normally, I would capture you all and present you to Her Majesty, but...</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Just as you have reserved judgement, I shall do the same.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> As long as Chaldea does not attack Britain, I shall not raise a hand against you.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Please enjoy your stay in Britain. And—</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Lady Artoria. Have you memorized the prophecy Ainsel left behind?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Y-yes, a bit.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> “From now, I will tell you of a future. The future of the mystical island which became the land of fairies. ”</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> “The innocent shall return. To the Queen&#39;s castle, bottomless as it is. ”</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> “Yet we must only endure a short time more. The morning when two thousand years have passed, the child of salvation will appear. ”</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> “They who unites fairies and humans, us and them. The child of salvation who will save the world. ”</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> “A city of iron, a sea of soot. When the calamity has been repelled, the pilgrimage will be hailed. ”</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> “Ring out, ring out; like thunderous fury, like fiery lamentation. Let the six bells toll in demonstration. Make way for the true king. ”</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I think that&#39;s how it went?</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> ...you cut out the majority, but that&#39;s the gist of it.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Oberon. Is she really the Child of Prophecy?</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> You can&#39;t even weaponize your best selling point, can you?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Don&#39;t be like that. She covered the important parts.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Even for you, only the last verse should matter. You&#39;re the guardian of the bell tower up here.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I don&#39;t know if I would call this a bell tower.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> He&#39;s right. Of the six bells in the prophecy.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> One of them is up here. What about the one in Salisbury?</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Wait a minute. Did you not come here to ring Gloucester&#39;s bell?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> That&#39;s...uh, how do I put this...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> We&#39;re looking for someone here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Do you know a human girl named Mash?</p><hr><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Mash...you say?</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> My apologies, but such a word has never been uttered in Gloucester.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Could they be in another city?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> I see. The little girl isn&#39;t here, I thought something was amiss.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> What, did she get lost? And you came to Gloucester to look for her?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yeah, because they said they were auctioning off a “fairy with iron weapons”!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But it was the wrong guy!</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Yeah, I&#39;ll take some of the blame for that one. I should have done a little more research.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> If I could have snuck into the auction room, I would have at least known if it was a man or a woman.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Hehehe, that&#39;s impossible.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> My auctions are strictly confidential and absolutely secure. Nothing gets in, not even a single ant or a drop of blood.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Seems that way. “Violence is not allowed in Gloucester. ”</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> That&#39;s the faith you&#39;ve been protecting for the last several hundred years, right Muryan? Or is it your purpose?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> But let&#39;s get back to the bells, Muryan.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> For someone who believes Artoria is the Child of Prophecy, aren&#39;t you being a little cold towards her?</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> ...to be honest, I&#39;m despondent.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Her Majesty is undoubtedly a magnificent sovereign. But she is far too ruthless.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> It&#39;s not just her existence tax. The treatment of humans. The persecution of non-clan fairies.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> How she&#39;s handling the Calamity. Her monopoly on the flotsam. Her awful law on the cessation of imitating human civilization.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> The declaration of Darlington&#39;s relocation and the subsequent construction of the National Theater of Slaughter in the last hundred years.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> She&#39;s always been merciless against those who oppose her, but appointing Tristan as her successor was simply going too far.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> ...Yes. For a time I&#39;d hoped she would be a queen who would protect Britain from the Calamities, but...</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Now, she&#39;s nothing more than a witch who runs Britain as she sees fit.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> I...we have been waiting for you, Lady Artoria. However—</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> As you are now, you do not inspire much confidence. I cannot imagine someone like you overthrowing the Queen.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> If the other clans were to take sides, I would consider it, but neither the Earth Clan nor the Wind Clan will make a move.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> So, you&#39;re not going to show us to Gloucester&#39;s bell?</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Not at present.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> I am the Lord of Gloucester. Until the end of time, I have reason to protect this city.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Backing Lady Artoria at this juncture would only be seen as treason against the Queen.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> My Fairy Territory would easily be cancelled out and fall under Queen Morgan&#39;s power.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> So, that&#39;s why...</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Please, return to Gloucester after you have gotten stronger.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> It can be any kind of strength. Connections, magic, money...</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Whatever it takes to defeat Her Majesty.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Don&#39;t forget, Artoria. You&#39;re the shining star of hope for the fairies.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> You&#39;re the chosen Child of Prophecy, the one to bring Britain out of its long twilight.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...the star of hope, for the fairies...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...get stronger, and come back...</p><hr><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Yes. For that reason, please do everything in your power to help Lady Artoria, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> You&#39;re good at dealing with the bad guys, right? I&#39;ve heard you have quite a bit of experience...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Muryan. I understand you are not our enemy.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But where are you getting all this information? Even if Muramasa told you stories, we&#39;re still strangers to you.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> In terms of danger, we&#39;re probably about the same level of “nuisance” to you as Queen Morgan is.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> And despite that, you trust Chaldea...or rather, you trust Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Something isn&#39;t adding up here. Is there something you&#39;re hiding?</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Ah, I see how it is—</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Of course. Just as well then, I&#39;ll introduce you.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Another visitor from the “outside” who has told me stories of you and Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Please, come and join us, Lady F. Umm, your real name was—</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Koyanskaya. Tamamovitch Koyanskaya, Princess.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Good day to you, Chaldea. I&#39;m glad to see you are doing well.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Koyanskaya—!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Another new outfit!</p><hr><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> You musn&#39;t. Please calm down, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> I told you, I won&#39;t tolerate violence in my Gloucester.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> And, she&#39;s an important client of mine. Actually, you could call her a business partner.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> She bears no enmity towards Britain, nor any desire to fight Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> As a matter of fact, she isn&#39;t supposed to be in Britain at all right now.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> I&#39;ve convinced her to stay here for my own selfish reasons.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hmm, what do you mean, “selfish”?</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> As my personal bodyguard, of course!</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Her one fault is her tremendous thirst for money, but her fighting prowess more than makes up for that!</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> And best of all, she can fight against the Mors! No longer do I have to bow down to the Fang Clan or the Fairy Knights!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> ...I see.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> I heard that once she transported Beryl out of Olympus, they lost contact...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Are you scrounging for something here in Britain as well? What are you up to, Koyanskaya?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> You were aiming for Chaldea and the Alien God to wipe each other out, but you were found out by the Alien God.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> You&#39;ve persevered up until this point, and now you&#39;re ready to show your true colours?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> No no no, not at all. The Alien God and I have an equal partnership.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> “Until such a time as we have achieved our goals, there will be no interference between us. ” That&#39;s the contract between me and that strange god.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> My outset has been completely different from that of you three Alter-Egos from the very start.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Lords Muramasa, Rasputin, and Limbo are Servants summoned by the Alien God,</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> But I am a Servant who has manifested by my own power. Therefore, I&#39;m free to do as I please.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> This time, Lady Muryan&#39;s proposal was too attractive, so I&#39;m staying here for now.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> It was brash of you to make an unnecessary detour to Britain. Regardless,</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> I have no interest in the Queen&#39;s endeavours, the humans of this Fairy Kingdom, or in any of you.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> I hope I make myself perfectly clear! ♡</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...you don&#39;t have any schemes planned, then?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> My, of course not. You see—</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> I don&#39;t need to interfere with this world, because it&#39;s already a complete disaster.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...so what on earth are you doing here, then?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Why, replenishing my stock, of course♡</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> I have obtained many a rare item unique to this fairyland.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Up to now the Lostbelts have been limited, crude, cluttered, science-fiction-y...</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Honestly they&#39;ve all been somewhat lacking, but this one is absolutely perfect! No complaints!</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Strange, beautiful, and so wonderfully gruesome.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Such wonderful designs, despite being a threat to all of humanity.</p><hr><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Koyanskaya. Please stop provoking confrontation when we are about to reach a settlement.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> You are beautiful in both body and soul, so why do you debase yourself?</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> We&#39;re going to cooperate with them anyway, so can you not be cordial?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Oops, there goes my mouth again. If that is what the client desires, so be it.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> That&#39;s how it is, [♂ Mr. /♀ Ms. ] Fujimaru, and da Vinci.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> We&#39;ve been through a lot, but here in Britain, we will be fellow members of pan-human history.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> I think it&#39;s best to let bygones be bygones, and devote ourselves to our mutual goals.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> At least, until you meet up with Mash. Isn&#39;t that right, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...you&#39;re right. The situation is what it is. We can&#39;t afford to deal with you on top of everything else.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> If you stay out of our way, we won&#39;t mess with you.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> I ought to slay her here and now. Well, can&#39;t shed any blood in front of Muryan.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Um, ummm...I don&#39;t know this person very well, so...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I don&#39;t know what to say...I-I&#39;ll leave it to you guys to decide!</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> A wise decision, ladies and gentlemen. I was in the mood for some casual sightseeing myself, as well.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> You disgust me.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> —Oberon, was it? What was that?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Shut it. Don&#39;t talk to me, your drivel rots my ears.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> As your friend, I must warn you, Muryan. This creature is utterly despicable.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> No matter the trust extended to this vixen, it will fall short. I suggest you cut ties with her while you still can.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> And we close in the worst possible fashion.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> You must have ruffled their feathers rather badly, Koyanskaya.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Yes, indeed.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Master Gordolf&#39;s mercenary forces were all but annihilated. Chaldea&#39;s main base was overrun, and all the staff&#39;s lives were...put on ice, shall we say?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> No wonder [♂ he /♀ she] despises my guts enough to want me dead. It&#39;s not surprising...</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Who&#39;s that Oberon Servant? He doesn&#39;t seem to be from the Fairy Kingdom, but...</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Oberon is a fairy who materialised in the Welsh forest about two months ago.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Ah, “Servant”, they call him. A heroic spirit from the past of pan-human history.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> He&#39;s been visiting cities all across Britain, proclaiming himself to be the “Fairy King. ”</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> He eventually ended up in Gloucester, and that&#39;s when we first met.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> ...at first I was overjoyed to meet him, because he looked so much like one of my fellow clansmen, but...</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> ...sorry. There&#39;s no obligation for me to tell you, but since not saying it would be dishonest, I&#39;ll just put it out there.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I&#39;m not part of the Wing Clan. I just look a bit like them. After all, your fellow members are already—</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Hmm, never mind that, you&#39;re the head of Gloucester, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I need an unsecured loan! The world is at stake here, you know!</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Well, as you could no doubt see, he&#39;s a jolly fellow. He&#39;s not a fairy king, maybe a clown king would be more fitting...</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> He told me in advance that the “Child of Prophecy” would be paying a visit today.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Is that so...</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> (Call it keen intuition, but I have a feeling squashing that horrisonant fly ahead of time might save us a LOT of trouble...)</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Oh, right. It looks like I can get you some of that “past history” that you&#39;ve been so eager to learn about.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Over 2,000 years of history...and very few people can speak of the “Fairy Calendar” any more.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> I bought up the treasured collection of a former librarian who was exiled from Camelot.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> It&#39;ll be arriving shortly.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> But I&#39;m surprised. I can&#39;t believe you want to know about our history...</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> It&#39;s completely different from pan-human history, so how would it be of assistance to you?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> That&#39;s exactly why.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> My goal is to find a Magical Beast that doesn&#39;t exist in the history of mankind.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> It doesn&#39;t matter what sort of creature it is. As long as it has “bodily hair”, it can be copied...</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> I&#39;m able to take it in as information and make it a part of me.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Nonetheless, I can only take up to nine big ones. I came to Britain to secure my sixth tail...</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> But now, I&#39;m much more interested in the origins of the Fairy Kingdom itself.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> But, I must apologise, Lady Muryan...You&#39;ve spent so much more than was necessary on my account...</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Don&#39;t worry. I too was a scholar, before I became lord of Gloucester.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> I used to disobey my father and stay in the library until late, immersing myself in the legend of Tonelico...</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> A true bookworm, I was...until the Queen allowed such brutality to take place.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> ...Then.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> You&#39;re going to wait for the Child of Prophecy to grow strong, and rebel against the Queen, aren&#39;t you, Lady Muryan?</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> ......No. Not at all!</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> The hope of all fairies? The saviour of Britain?</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> The Child of Prophecy who will end the tyrannical rule of Her Majesty Morgan...</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> I wasn&#39;t expecting it to ever happen...but there was never a time when I wasn&#39;t thinking about it.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> And the fact it was such a lowly fairy was quite a surprise!</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Her magical energy is average, her beauty is average. Her size is average. She doesn&#39;t even have her own Fairy Territory!</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Who is going to be saved by a fairy like that? The only thing you should trust in is your own power, after all.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Senji Muramasa. It&#39;s a shame you didn&#39;t become mine after spending so much time here, but...</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> With your help, there wouldn&#39;t be any need for a “Child of Prophecy”.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> I can make good use of both Chaldea, and the “Child of Prophecy”.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> If that filthy human Master defeats just one Fairy Knight, it&#39;s all over.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> If one of the Fairy Knights falls, there&#39;ll be no stopping Knocknarea in the north.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> Her Majesty Morgan, and Knocknarea. The Child of Prophecy, and Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Muryan:</strong> To the brave who survive, I hereby invite you to my “gameboard”—</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Aww. We finally had the chance to talk to a clan head, then Oberon screwed it all up.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Telling us to &quot;please go home&quot; in the worst possible manner...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> &quot;Ochazuke is delicious, hooray! &quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> That was my fault, I&#39;ll own it. I was immature.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> But I&#39;m not apologizing. I said what I had to say.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Mm. I like you, Oberon.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> It takes a lot of courage to say something like that in front of that vixen.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Or maybe it was all an act? Either way, you&#39;re a top-class orator.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> You must come from a pretty good-natured legend. Tell me about it sometime.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> ...but is this really alright? Putting aside the Child of Prophecy...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Muryan seemed like she wanted to cooperate with Chaldea...with Fujimaru...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Oh, don&#39;t worry about that.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Muryan was in no mood to help us in any case.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Is that so?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Why?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Muryan wanted military strength that was not of the Queen or Child of Prophecy, but only of Gloucester.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I guess she had her eye on Chaldea at first. But now, she&#39;s gotten her hands on—</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I see, because Koyanskaya&#39;s already here...</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Yeah. Muryan&#39;s got her hands on a trump card that she can use at her leisure.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> That&#39;s why she doesn&#39;t have to ally with us anymore, and she doesn&#39;t need to waste time endorsing the Child of Prophecy.</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I-I see...there&#39;s no use for me here either—</p><p><strong>Low-Class Gloucester Fairies:</strong> Ah, there you are! Hey, wait up–!</p><p><strong>Low-Class Gloucester Fairies:</strong> Child of Prophecy! Everyone, you&#39;re friends with the Child of Prophecy, right!?</p><p><strong>Low-Class Gloucester Fairy:</strong> Where did she go? Did she leave already? Maybe already to the next city?</p><p><strong>Low-Class Gloucester Fairy:</strong> Well of course! If she stays in one place too long, Woodwose&#39;s soldiers will track her down!</p><p><strong>Low-Class Gloucester Fairy:</strong> Aah, I just wanted a single glance...but it can&#39;t be helped. It&#39;s the Child of Prophecy after all!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> A-ah, everybody, um—</p><p><strong>Low-Class Gloucester Fairies:</strong> But it&#39;s all right, you guys can take it. Here, it&#39;s not much, but I want you to have this.</p><p><strong>Low-Class Gloucester Fairies:</strong> One day the Child of Prophecy will appear. I&#39;ve been saving up, believing in that.</p><p><strong>Low-Class Gloucester Fairies:</strong> It&#39;s nothing but a bunch of cheap stuff like small change, secondhand clothes, stones, and tree roots, but...</p><p><strong>Low-Class Gloucester Fairies:</strong> It&#39;s all we can do right now. I think it&#39;ll definitely be useful for something.</p><p><strong>Low-Class Gloucester Fairies:</strong> So please, take it. I&#39;m begging you.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> —</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Yes. I&#39;ll gladly keep it safe. The Child of Prophecy will definitely be overjoyed to hear that.</p><p><strong>Low-Class Gloucester Fairies:</strong> I see...yeah, of course! Everyone, be sure to keep the Child safe!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> —</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Wow. That&#39;s a mountain of gifts. Can you carry it in your arms, da Vinci?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Of course. Getting them out of the city will be no problem. I&#39;ll hold on to them until we get to the carriage.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> This is great, Artoria. They didn&#39;t recognize you as the real thing, but...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Even here in Gloucester, the Child of Prophecy has become everybody&#39;s hope.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Yes. With this we won&#39;t have to worry about components for magecraft or food for Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> All right then. After going through so much trouble to get here, I&#39;d at least like to spend the night in Gloucester, but...</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> If even the common folk know about that dustup in the auction house,</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> the Queen&#39;s men will already know we&#39;re here. We shouldn&#39;t linger.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> T-that&#39;s true. But Mash&#39;s trail...</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> ...if Muryan hasn&#39;t heard anything, then there&#39;s nothing to be learned in Gloucester.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> With no sightings in either Salisbury or Gloucester, we&#39;re out of luck.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> We&#39;re still being hunted for that one incident at the farm. It&#39;s likely we&#39;ll be caught by the Queen&#39;s soldiers if we move recklessly.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I think we should temporarily call off the search on foot at this point, but what do you think?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...sorry. Would it be suicide to head to another city?</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Yeah. It&#39;s dangerous to go back to Salisbury at this point.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Therefore, how about we continue our search for Mash via other means?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I&#39;ll have you guys go into hiding, and in the meantime I&#39;ll send spies out to gather information on Mash.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I said “the search on foot,” didn&#39;t I?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> In three days we&#39;ll have all of Britain&#39;s latest news. We can go back to what we&#39;ve been doing after that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Thank you, Oberon...!</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> No, it&#39;s nothing worth thanking me for. The truth is, it&#39;s just a half-hearted plan of action.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> But where are we going to hide...?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Of course, I&#39;ve already thought of that. I came up with this plan because the geographic conditions are good, you could say.</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> So we&#39;ll be camping outdoors for a bit. Let&#39;s look for a place where we won&#39;t be seen.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Hehehe, leave the tent to me! I know all sorts of Bounded Fields for warding off evil spirits!</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Really? That&#39;s reassuring, but we won&#39;t need them this time.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Huh?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Ah, I see...sorry to take away your moment in the spotlight, Artoria.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> But I want to go somewhere I can trust for now, so be patient.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> With that said—we finally get to use my secret base!</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> You see that forest over the hills to the west? That&#39;s the forest of Wales.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> It&#39;s a place of relaxation for “withering things,” fairies and humans that have been abandoned.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> It&#39;s the domain of the Fairy King, good ol&#39; me.</p><h2 id="section-5-fragment-3-sheffield-i" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-5-fragment-3-sheffield-i" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 5: Fragment / 3 - Sheffield (I)</h2><p><strong>Wag:</strong> Look Annis, you can see it! That&#39;s the cornerstone of the north, the city of Sheffield!</p><p><strong>Annis:</strong> It&#39;s a very imposing citadel! Is that castle on a hill!?</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Yeah, and the only places with walls like that are Camelot and here.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Did you know? The castle walls of the Fairy Kingdom are special.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Wall-building fae spent a long time building them, and they act as Bounded Fields.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Essentially, you can only enter or exit through the “gate”.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> If the gate is open, you can easily pass through. If the gate is closed, it prohibits passage.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> It&#39;s a magical wall built with those “rules”.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> With exceptions of water circulation and windows, as long as the gates are guarded, they are well protected.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> I heard that Boggart oversaw the construction of everything, including the castle.</p><p><strong>Annis:</strong> Boggart? Is he the Lord of Sheffield?</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> You got it! Boggart, the embodiment of big talk, Boggart the loveless!</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> A thug who not only lost the battle for the head of the Fangs, but also got himself kicked out of Norwich!</p><p><strong>Annis:</strong> He competed for the position of head of the Fang Clan...he must be a very imposing person.</p><p><strong>Annis:</strong> I kind of get why you call him a big talker, but...what do you mean by “loveless? ”</p><p><strong>Winky:</strong> He means that literally, Annis. Boggart&#39;s arranged himself marriages with human women.</p><p><strong>Winky:</strong> Every fairy he&#39;s had as a wife up until now has hated him.</p><p><strong>Winky:</strong> Battles of manners with Woodwose. Money games with Spriggan.</p><p><strong>Winky:</strong> His wives betrayed him at the last second in both of those, so he cast them out.</p><p><strong>Winky:</strong> Ever since then, Boggart has had a human mistress by his side.</p><p><strong>Winky:</strong> He thinks that if they&#39;re slaves, they won&#39;t betray him. That&#39;s why he&#39;s called “Boggart the loveless. ”</p><p><strong>Winky:</strong> Well, if you ask me, he just doesn&#39;t believe in love anymore.</p><p><strong>Annis:</strong> That&#39;s...he must be so miserable.</p><p><strong>Annis:</strong> But, he still built such an amazing fortress. He seems like such an honorable man!</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> You really get into buildings, or rather, castle walls, Annis. I wonder if you were somehow involved with castles after all...</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> You remember anything about that? It would be great if you could at least remember where you were born.</p><p><strong>Annis:</strong> No, everything from before you saved me is still...just, how do I put this...</p><p><strong>Annis:</strong> I get the feeling...I came here with a very important purpose...</p><p><strong>Wag:</strong> Of course you did! You are the “Child of Prophecy! ”</p><p><strong>Wag:</strong> A Fairy Knight here to protect us! The savior of Britain!</p><p><strong>Annis:</strong> ...Yes. I&#39;d be glad if that was the case.</p><p><strong>Annis:</strong> I&#39;ve seen many different places in Britain up to now.</p><p><strong>Annis:</strong> I&#39;ve been here less than ten days...but I think it&#39;s a very, very beautiful country.</p><p><strong>Annis:</strong> If I really do hold the power to protect this country, I couldn&#39;t be any happier.</p><p><strong>Winky:</strong> ...Hey Wag, Rob, we&#39;re almost at the checkpoint.</p><p><strong>Winky:</strong> It&#39;s now or never. Call an intermediary and let&#39;s get this over with.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> R-right. This isn&#39;t a good time to be in Sheffield.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> But, what the hell? We&#39;ve come this far, so what&#39;s the harm in sticking together a little while longer?</p><p><strong>Wag:</strong> Hm? We&#39;re introducing Annis to Boggart, aren&#39;t we? Then we have to head to the castle.</p><p><strong>Winky:</strong> ...Haa, all right, whatever you want.</p><p><strong>Winky:</strong> This is too heavy a load for stingy peddlers and wannabe bandits.</p><p><strong>Annis:</strong> ...?</p><p><strong>White Wolf:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> And so, the wagon reached Sheffield.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> It was about the same time as when Fujimaru was still asleep in the Nameless Forest.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> About the same time as when da Vinci had reached Salisbury, and first met Mike at the tavern.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> In the turbulent city of Sheffield, where the flag of rebellion was raised against Queen Morgan,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> the “other Child of Prophecy” entered the stage.</p><p>Note! Scene Change</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> The Child of Prophecy? That little girl?</p><p><strong>Rob &amp; Wag:</strong> Y-yes! There&#39;s no mistaking it, Master Boggart!</p><p><strong>Rob &amp; Wag:</strong> Iron shield and armor, and a dangerous-looking iron cylinder! And on top of that, she&#39;s got monstrous strength, strong enough to crush rocks!</p><p><strong>Rob &amp; Wag:</strong> Please forgive the lack of information about her hometown, for that is a maiden&#39;s secret!</p><p><strong>Rob &amp; Wag:</strong> This is Annis, the Child of Prophecy, destined to save Britain!</p><p><strong>Rob &amp; Wag:</strong> Please, give her the highest appraisal and treatment she deserves!</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> —Idiots. This girl is no fairy.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Don&#39;t think you can fool my nose. She&#39;s a human.</p><p><strong>Rob &amp; Wag:</strong> —Huh? Annis is a human...? Don&#39;t mess with us like that!</p><p><strong>Rob &amp; Wag:</strong> Her body and magical energy are on par with a fairy&#39;s! To begin with, there&#39;s no way a human could possess that kind of strength!</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Humans can be mighty warriors too, although it is rare.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> This girl...she does indeed have the scent of a fairy, but she also smells very slightly of a human.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Coming here, to sell me such a product. You&#39;ve underestimated me.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> In my Sheffield, liars are criminals and fraud is a capital offense.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Guards. Seize them. Imprison the girl. Hang the merchants.</p><p><strong>Human Guard:</strong> Sir!</p><p><strong>Rob &amp; Wag:</strong> Aaaaaah! S-save us, Annis!</p><p><strong>The Human Guards:</strong> Uaaaaah—!?</p><p><strong>Annis:</strong> I&#39;m sorry, but please stand back! What&#39;s more, Rob and the others are not liars!</p><p><strong>Annis:</strong> I don&#39;t have my memories, so I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m really the Child of Prophecy myself, but—</p><p><strong>Annis:</strong> If the two of them believe in me, then I&#39;m the “Child of Prophecy” for them both!</p><p><strong>Annis:</strong> If you think they&#39;re bad, then please treat me the same way!</p><p><strong>Rob &amp; Wag:</strong> Annis—</p><p><strong>Human Guard:</strong> Tch, this girl is absurd...! Call in the Fang soldiers!</p><p><strong>Human Guard:</strong> We can&#39;t handle her on our own. Protect Lord Boggart!</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> —Wait. Don&#39;t waste your energy. She&#39;s not hostile.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> ...So it wasn&#39;t a trick after all. Very well, I&#39;ll hear you out.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Give the merchants their payment. What is your name, brave girl?</p><p><strong>Annis:</strong> Ah, yes...they gave me the wonderful name of Annis.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> ...Good grief. You don&#39;t eat children, do you?</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Forget the name “Annis”. Hey, are there any guards that can still move?</p><p><strong>Human Guard:</strong> Y-yes. I can somewhat...everyone else is still numb from that impact...</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Take her to Habetrot&#39;s atelier. As soon as the preparations are made, show her to the princess&#39; chambers.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> While I am not impressed with her slender build, the way she demonstrated her strength was to my liking. I have yet to savor the sight of such a woman.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Rejoice, young lady. For you will be my partner this evening.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Bathe yourself and wait for nightfall, my 62nd “bride”.</p><p><strong>Rob &amp; Wag:</strong> Briiiiide!? Annis is getting married!?</p><p><strong>Annis:</strong> Huh?</p><p>Note! Scene Change</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> And so she arrived.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> To the fairy destined to protect her until the very end. At the atelier of the jolly and ever-popular Habetrot.</p><p><strong>Human Guard:</strong> Habenyan. Habenyan...you&#39;ve got a new job, Habenyan...</p><p><strong>Human Guard:</strong> I know you&#39;ve got a mountain of stuff to do already, but please hear me out without losing your temper, Habenyan...</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Quit talking to me like I&#39;m your cat–! I told you to stop bringing me more work–!</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> I came here because you said I would be sewing dresses, but every day it&#39;s nothing but armor, spears, and bags!</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Who do you think I am!? I&#39;m the finest dressmaker in Britain, the great Habetrot!</p><p><strong>Annis:</strong> —S-sorry.</p><p><strong>Annis:</strong> Boggart told me to get changed in here, so...</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> —</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> ...did it......did it...</p><p><strong>Human Guard:</strong> Habenyan? Have you finally broken down? Well, you&#39;ve always been a little bit funny in the head, but...</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> I did it, I finally got a decent job–! Oh, but this was worth the wait–!</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> No problem. She needs a dress, right? I&#39;ll get it done in a jiffy!</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> You&#39;re adorable, after all! It&#39;s decided, I&#39;ll make you my bride too!</p><p><strong>Annis:</strong> Bride...in addition to being Boggart&#39;s bride, will I now also be this fairy&#39;s bride?</p><p><strong>Human Guard:</strong> Oh, pay no attention to her. She&#39;s just that kind of fairy.</p><p><strong>Human Guard:</strong> A while back we put out a call for “fairies who can make wedding dresses”, and she just showed up suddenly.</p><p><strong>Human Guard:</strong> She&#39;s good at what she does, but the way she acts is a little strange...Old-fashioned, or maybe it&#39;s better to say she goes at her own pace...</p><p><strong>Human Guard:</strong> I don&#39;t even know whether she understands that we&#39;re rebelling against Morgan or not.</p><p><strong>Human Guard:</strong> But her skills are the real deal. According to her, she&#39;s “a bride&#39;s best friend. ”</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> That&#39;s right. I&#39;m the yarn spinner, Habetrot. A professional seamstress.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> I&#39;m a fairy who secretly helps brides who&#39;re all in a tissy before they get married.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Well, that&#39;s beside the point—</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> I&#39;ve been ready to go for a long time. Let&#39;s get your measurements done right away.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Guard, out, out! Leave me alone with her!</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> And tell Boggart he has to wait a day! He thinks everything can be done in a rush!</p><p><strong>Human Guard:</strong> S-sure. You want me to bring you some milk later?</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> As reward for my work, of course! Heat some up and bring it back!</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Hello, young lady. It&#39;s all right, there&#39;s no need to be scared.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> All these sudden developments, and you don&#39;t know what to make of it all, is that right?</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> But I&#39;m your new best friend. After all, I&#39;m the sworn ally of all future brides, Habetrot!</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Enough of that iron armor. Let me prepare a special dress for you.</p><p><strong>Annis:</strong> H-hello, nice to meet you, Habenyan. I&#39;m Annis...no, I mean...</p><p><strong>Annis:</strong> Boggart told me not to use that name.</p><p><strong>Annis:</strong> Annis...could it be an important name to Boggart?</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Oh, Annis. That&#39;s definitely not good.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> A long time ago, there was a scary fairy called Black Annis. She kidnapped children and ate them.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> You&#39;re nothing like her. Let&#39;s see...excuse me for a second.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Ah, I thought so. I&#39;ll call you Mash. Is that alright?</p><p><strong>A：Mash:</strong> Yes. It&#39;s hard to throw away the name Annis, but I&#39;m not uncomfortable with the sound of that one either.</p><p><strong>A：Mash:</strong> But why Mash, exactly?</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> It&#39;s written on your shield, see? Look, on the back. It says “Mash” in chalk.</p><p><strong>A：Mash:</strong> Ah! Oh, it does! So big too, I hadn&#39;t even noticed it!</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> You&#39;ve got a few screws loose for someone who writes their name on all their belongings!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Thus, she rediscovered her true name. But, it was still a mere formality.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> There would be some time yet until she was truly “Mash” once again.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> All right, done with the measurements, let&#39;s get to wor~k! Oh, do you have a favorite color?</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Your armor was black, but I think you&#39;d look great in white!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Habetrot was in a good mood as she skillfully cut the fabric with scissors.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> —And so, the next day.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Habetrot&#39;s greatest, most joyous occasion came to an end.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> All right, I&#39;ve finished with the adjustments. You can open your eyes, Mash. Take a look at yourself in the mirror.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> —</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh my goodness...! Such a wonderful dress, Habenyan!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s easy to move around in, warm, and best of all, it&#39;s very soft on the skin.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s like I&#39;m covered in stars...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m such a lucky bride, for you to have done this for me so soon after I arrived!</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Yeah. Good morning, Mash.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> It&#39;s a relief. I&#39;m so glad you like it.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> And now, the true story begins.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> No longer the Knight of the Shield, but a princess envied by all.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> A time of peace, unlike any other in the Fairy Kingdom. The truly shining days had begun.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> For you see, it would only be a short while before the fortress of Sheffield would crumble in flames.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> In the early morning, the castle town was bustling, as if celebrating a festival.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Rumors of the princess spread like wildfire. A knight adorned in iron armor, who could hold their own against Mors and Black Dog alike,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> a princess stronger than Boggart himself—more on that later.</p><p><strong>Fairy Soldiers:</strong> Did you hear about the new princess!? The one who blew away Lord Boggart!</p><p><strong>Fairy Soldiers:</strong> Lord Boggart can withstand a blow to the face from Gawain, so that&#39;s a considerable feat!</p><p><strong>Townspeople:</strong> The merchants who brought her here say she&#39;s the Child of Prophecy.</p><p><strong>Townspeople:</strong> If she&#39;s the real deal...maybe, just maybe, we can return to Norwich!</p><p><strong>Human Soldiers:</strong> Yeah, I caught a glimpse of her at the castle yesterday. That is the real Child of Prophecy.</p><p><strong>Human Soldiers:</strong> The very air around her is different! She&#39;s no ordinary fairy!</p><p><strong>Human Soldiers:</strong> Best of all was the lovely smile on her face when she looked my way! She&#39;s a match even for Lancelot!</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Heh, you hear that Wag, Winky?</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> The whole town is talking about Annis...I mean, Mash!</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> That Boggart guy paid us a lot of money for her! Now we&#39;ll have nothing to worry about this winter!</p><p><strong>Wag:</strong> But we haven&#39;t been able to see Mash since...never thought she&#39;d be living in the castle...</p><p><strong>Wag:</strong> I thought she&#39;d stay with us forever...</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> D-dumbass, have a little patience! Boggart will be bored of her soon enough.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Then we&#39;ll just pick up Mash, and head to Edinburgh next!</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Knocknarea in the North will pay an even higher price for the Child of Prophecy!</p><p><strong>Winky:</strong> Hey now. Aside from how much of an idiot Wag is, what are you thinking about, Rob?</p><p><strong>Winky:</strong> Mash is just a commodity. Once she&#39;s sold, that&#39;s it. She has nothing to do with us anymore.</p><p><strong>Winky:</strong> It&#39;s about time we departed Sheffield. If we stay too long, we&#39;ll never be able to leave.</p><p><strong>Wag:</strong> What are you saying, Winky? We can&#39;t just run away. We&#39;ve got money, so why don&#39;t we just stay here until the spring?</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Right, Mash protected us! She protected outcasts like me and Wag!</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> We&#39;re staying here until we can return that favor. If you want to leave, you&#39;re on your own, Winky.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Unlike us, you&#39;ve got a good head about you, and you&#39;re from this Kingdom to begin with.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> You&#39;re not like us outcasts who drifted here. You could make it anywhere!</p><p><strong>Winky:</strong> ...that&#39;s a bit of a stretch.</p><p><strong>Winky:</strong> The cleverer you are, the more cynical you&#39;ll end up, and the less you can overturn your beliefs.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> For the record, I don&#39;t recognize you as the Child of Prophecy.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> I let the townspeople say what they like because it is a convenience for them.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Do you understand? Don&#39;t think you have any right to speak of this.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Strength alone is not enough to stand against Morgan. The dignity and grace of a king are required.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> You need not be anything more than a decoration. To stand by my side and represent the image of a good princess.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I understand, Lord Boggart. The dignity expected of the Princess of Sheffield, you mean?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> By the way, did you get enough rest last night? I&#39;m so very sorry for my rudeness...</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> I&#39;m not even scratched. You don&#39;t need to worry.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Guards. I will be going to the barracks now. I have to see to the condition of the soldiers.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Keep an eye on the princess. And make sure she doesn&#39;t leave the castle.</p><p><strong>Fairy Guardsman:</strong> Sir! Leave it to us, Lord Boggart!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Boggart may have been a cold-hearted fairy, but was an ideal fit to be Lord of Sheffield.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> For the coming confrontation with the Queen&#39;s army, he gathered mercenaries, trained his soldiers, and fortified the walls of his castle.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> For the sake of not wanting to lose more than he already had, he strengthened his army.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Despite his underlying fear, Boggart made for a good king at this time.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> — (※Mm, acting dignified. )</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> — (※Mmmm, puffing up her chest in a dignified manner. )</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> — (※ Realizes that&#39;s probably not what she should be doing. )</p><p><strong>Fairy Guardsman:</strong> Uh, Lady Mash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Y-Yes! I&#39;m the princess, what about it!?</p><p><strong>Fairy Guardsman:</strong> Yes, I know.</p><p><strong>Fairy Guardsman:</strong> Uh, Lady Mash is Lord Boggart&#39;s wife. So does that mean you&#39;ll be the ruling Lady of Sheffield?</p><p><strong>Fairy Guardsman:</strong> If that&#39;s the case...Um, for the sake of the people, I have a favor to ask...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...?</p><p><strong>Fairy Guardsman:</strong> Lately, there have been a lot of Mors sightings west of Sheffield!</p><p><strong>Fairy Guardsman:</strong> According to the merchants, Lady Mash can touch the Mors and not get corrupted!</p><p><strong>Fairy Guardsman:</strong> We of the Fang Clan are relatively more resistant to the Mors&#39; toxin than the others, but...</p><p><strong>Fairy Guardsman:</strong> It&#39;s still...really painful, so...please, lend us your strength!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So that&#39;s why you&#39;ve brought me outside! Of course, leave everything to me!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;ll do my best, as the one who accidentally destroyed the castle walls last night! Mmph!</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Mmph! So cuuuuuute! But that&#39;s wroooooong!</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> What are you doing with Mash, you well-mannered guaaaard!?</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> At what point did the Kingdom become so dangerous that we need princesses to fight for us!?</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Should I tell Boggart!?</p><p><strong>Fairy Guardsman:</strong> But protection of one&#39;s land is the duty of a lord (and his wife)...and besides, Queen Morgan (the princess) is a villain to begin with...</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Did you just call my bride evil, you bastaaaaard! Take a good look at how pretty she is!</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> She couldn&#39;t hurt a butterfly, or even trample a flower! She&#39;s the happiest bride on the face of the Earth—</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Why are you wearing armor!? You didn&#39;t rip my dress, did you!?</p><p><strong>H：Mash:</strong> It&#39;s no problem! I put it on over the dress, and it fits perfectly!</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> You&#39;ll wrinkle it doing that...and I&#39;ll have to finish up a new one later...</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> But, this comes first!</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> I won&#39;t let Mash fight all by herself! I&#39;ll fight by your side!</p><p><strong>H：Mash:</strong> Eh...you can&#39;t, Habenyan! If you touch the Mors, you&#39;ll...!</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Stuff like extermination of Mors only requires a little creative thinking. Fairies these days have just gotten lazy.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> More importantly! My name is Habetrot! Mash, even you are forbidden from calling me Habenyan!</p><p><strong>H：Mash:</strong> Eh, no way...! Why not!?! —</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Hah...hah...</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> I knew that fighting would be tough, but all that hard work is no fun at all...</p><p><strong>H：Mash:</strong> Habetrot, you&#39;re amazing!</p><p><strong>H：Mash:</strong> I&#39;ve never seen a fairy with such sharp movements before!</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> R-really? That was a craftsman&#39;s once-a-day finishing touch dive.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Working on wedding dresses from dusk &#39;till dawn. Speed Star Habenyan, they call me.</p><p><strong>Fairy Guardsman:</strong> Y-yeah...I was surprised as well. Lord Boggart&#39;s judgement is superb.</p><p><strong>Fairy Guardsman:</strong> That thread-spinning contraption, could it be a creation from the Wing Clan?</p><p><strong>Fairy Guardsman:</strong> But, the Wing Clan left Muryan behind 1,200 years ago...</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Muryan? By Muryan, you mean Game Master Muryan?</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Huh, so she&#39;s still alive, then. Or maybe her “daughter” has taken over.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Well, doesn&#39;t matter. What&#39;s important is that we beat the Mors.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> We&#39;ll be thanked for this, right? You should treat us to a nice lunch.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> It might be against the rules to enjoy a meal in front of Boggart, but in town, there&#39;s no need to worry.</p><p><strong>Fairy Guardsman:</strong> Yeah, of course! And since we can introduce Lady Mash to everyone, we&#39;ll be killing two birds with one stone!</p><p><strong>H：Mash:</strong> Is this really alright?</p><p><strong>H：Mash:</strong> Lord Boggart told me to make sure to keep a low profile, so...</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> It&#39;s fine, it&#39;s fine! Besides, he won&#39;t be back until this evening!</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> You&#39;ve had it rough up until now, haven&#39;t you? You should enjoy yourself as much as you can.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> The fairies of Sheffield love human culture, so there&#39;s no bias against humans here.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> If we go to the tavern, we can have a big party with you as its focus. Everyone will be happy, Mash will be happy, and I&#39;ll be happy!</p><p><strong>Fairy Guardsman:</strong> That&#39;s right. Lord Boggart&#39;s forbidden the treatment of humans as slaves here from the get-go.</p><p><strong>Fairy Guardsman:</strong> We&#39;re all fellow outcasts, after all. Everybody&#39;s on equal footing here.</p><p><strong>Fairy Guardsman:</strong> No, if anything, the humans saved us...</p><p><strong>Fairy Guardsman:</strong> Personally, I also have a human woman I&#39;d like to propose to...</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Ah, that&#39;s right. Sheffield is a free town.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> I was sure it was just Boggart trying to act cool. Queen Morgan&#39;s opposite, or something like that.</p><p><strong>H：Mash:</strong> ...Um, by fellow outcasts...?</p><p><strong>Fairy Guardsman:</strong> Oh, did you not know? Until a hundred years ago, this city was abandoned.</p><p><strong>Fairy Guardsman:</strong> Then Boggart and the rest of us rebuilt it, into the Sheffield you see today.</p><p><strong>Fairy Guardsman:</strong> We were originally citizens of Norwich, but were banished by Lord Spriggan,</p><p><strong>Fairy Guardsman:</strong> and had nowhere else to go, so we drifted here. That&#39;s why—</p><p><strong>Fairy Guardsman:</strong> ...That&#39;s why we can&#39;t overlook what&#39;s going on in Norwich.</p><p><strong>Fairy Guardsman:</strong> The Queen has taken no measures against the Calamity Pool that sprung forth above the city.</p><p><strong>Fairy Guardsman:</strong> We may have been exiled, but Norwich is our home.</p><p><strong>Fairy Guardsman:</strong> In an effort to save it, Lord Boggart is flying the flag of rebellion against the Queen.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> In the moments just before the curtain of night fell. In your world, it would be the hour of dusk.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> She stood alone atop the castle walls, looking out over the Fairy Kingdom.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The twilit sky stretched out without end, over the image of Britain, ever beautiful, yet ever sorrowful.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> —</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> What are you doing? Did you forget the way back to the castle?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Boggart. The view is quite beautiful here.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Address me as Lord when you speak to me. Don&#39;t forget to show me proper respect.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> It&#39;s only natural we should have a good view. This place is meant for keeping an eye out for invaders of our territory.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> However, what you and I see as “good” is entirely different.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> This was once a battlefield. Only recently have the bloodstains begun to fade.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I&#39;m sorry. I did not know about the circumstances of this town, it was selfish of me.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> ...to you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes? What was that, Lord Boggart?</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> —</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> ...nothing. This scenery, it looks good to you?</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> These desolate hills as far as the eye can see. These hills, not of the world of man, ruled by us fairies.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. To me, they appear irreplaceable.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> When I look at them, I get a feeling of profound loneliness, but also of affection.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Rob, Wag, Winky...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> All the people who have ended up here, everyone in Sheffield...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I understand everyone is suffering. I don&#39;t quite understand why that is, but...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Everybody desires “to live here”. They want to live in this city, no matter how difficult.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I don&#39;t think a Britain that wishes for no more than that can be ugly.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> —</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> ...What a foolish opinion. This is why humans are so troublesome.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Return to the castle. You can be seen from the barracks here. Your being here is a distraction to the soldiers.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> I&#39;ll be late tonight. Have Habetrot keep an eye on you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. Thank you for your concern, Lord Boggart.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...and that&#39;s what he said. Lord Boggart is a fine lord, isn&#39;t he?</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> You&#39;re just being deceived, Mash! There&#39;s nothing decent about a man who makes his wife call him by his title!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I-is that so? I thought that was because of his position as a lord.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Since when I called him that, he had a very pained look in his eyes...</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> What the hell, that&#39;s even worse! Old lion-face is actually a devoted husband!</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Don&#39;t mess with my bride, even if your marriage is only for appearances&#39; sake!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> For appearances...you mean, this is a fake marriage...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A-am I actually a deceitful vixen who&#39;s using her womanly charm to seduce the gentle Lord Boggart...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Am I actually an unmatched seductress in addition to the Child of Prophecy!?</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Hahahahahahahaha, well, maybe you are!</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> This is too much for Boggart to handle! He&#39;s the kind of guy who needs to be hated!</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> You&#39;re his natural enemy! Your predecessors must have really screwed up, Boggart!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh? What do you mean “needs to be hated? ”</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> I&#39;m talking about the underlying desires and special traits of fairies.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> “I want to be loved,” “I want to be hated,” “I want to be protected,” “I want to be hurt. ”</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Human emotions change over time, but the desires of fairies have a fixed direction.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Boggart&#39;s trying to suppress his violent impulses through reasoning.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> He wants someone to hate, and he can&#39;t display his true quality without that.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Well, as long as Mash is Mash, Boggart can&#39;t be too rough.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> As long as I am who I am...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But...how can I do that?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I have no memories. I didn&#39;t even know my own name.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Until I came here, no, until Rob and the others called me the Child of Prophecy...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I didn&#39;t know what to do or what I should be doing.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No, from the very start—</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Did I even have a “self”, before I lost my memories?</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> ...What do you mean?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...There is one thing I&#39;ve come to learn from losing my memories.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> There&#39;s a void in my heart, like a big hole.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> All fairies have a purpose. You could say it&#39;s the “gain they desire”.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Helping someone for money. Hurting someone for money.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But I don&#39;t have that—</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It always becomes apparent after I help others.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I ask myself, “What do I want, now that I&#39;ve come to help? ”</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s such an empty feeling.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...And as someone with a heart, that wasn&#39;t something that could be endured forever.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Before I lost my memories, I was probably not even aware of this emptiness.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But now I understand. Because I can&#39;t remember anything else, I can&#39;t fool myself anymore.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> There was some part of me missing.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No, there&#39;s a gap waiting to be filled by something, but I stubbornly refused to let it be filled.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> And...I really feel like there&#39;s nothing I can do about it.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Habetrot blinked at the unexpected confession.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Losing her memories wasn&#39;t all bad. She had become aware of an even grander problem.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Right. Not many people understand what kind of personality they have, or what they really want.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> They say that you finally understand right before you die, but unfortunately, we&#39;re still alive.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> What you need is the urge to live in the “present. ” A purpose you can be proud of, to become someone you can love.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> You said there&#39;s a gap, huh?</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> It&#39;s not just the contemplation of what you should do as a person. It&#39;s the desire to act as yourself, what they call an ego.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> You don&#39;t notice it until you&#39;re being supported by someone, but—</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Finding that is a journey for you and you alone, Mash.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> It might seem like a big deal to leave off right in the midst of it, but do not fret.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> She won&#39;t get her hands on the answer until much, much later.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> For now, a few small words of encouragement will suffice,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> so that one day, the wheel of time may spin a story just for you.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Oops, I forgot an important scene. How about we go back in time for a bit?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;ve been waiting for you, milord. Thank you for your hard work as lord of the city.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Hm. The image of a wife showing devotion to her husband, is it?</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> How shrewd. I see through your shallow wisdom, young lady.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Your fate is decided if you act obediently.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> My objective is the throne. I will kill Morgan, even if I have to defeat the clans.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Everything is no more than a tool to achieve that. You are no different, “Child of Prophecy”.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> I&#39;m used to embracing humans. Let&#39;s scatter some flowers here.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Resist if you so desire. However, don&#39;t expect to be treated gently, alright?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> In the room for honored guests at Sheffield Castle, the room reserved for Mash,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> the Child of Prophecy was told to don her wedding gown and await Boggart&#39;s visit that evening.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> To put it simply, she was the 62nd bride, and this was her wedding night.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Gwaaaaaaaagh—!?</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Yeeaaaaaaargh!?</p><p><strong>Garden Guard:</strong> What&#39;s going on, is it a siege!? —Lord B-Boggart!?</p><p><strong>Garden Guard:</strong> What on earth!? Aah, the wall near the throne is collapsing!</p><p><strong>Garden Guard:</strong> Everyone, to arms! Lord Boggart&#39;s been assassinated!</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Stop that nonsense, I&#39;m still alive! Don&#39;t call the guards! I merely slipped!</p><p><strong>Garden Guard:</strong> Ah! M-my apologies!</p><p><strong>Garden Guard:</strong> How very like the Rock Lion, to be unscathed after falling more than 50 meters!</p><p><strong>Voice from Above:</strong> I-I&#39;m so sorry, Boggart! I&#39;m coming right now!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Are you hurt!? I&#39;m sorry, I was so very nervous...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You tried to use my shoulder as support when you stumbled from exhaustion, but—</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It was so sudden, I reached out...and he just flew off...</p><p><strong>Garden Guard:</strong> ...(silently realizes what has happened)</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Guardsman. Not a word of this to anyone, understood?</p><p><strong>Garden Guard:</strong> Sir! I understand! I didn&#39;t see a thing!</p><p><strong>Garden Guard:</strong> Now please excuse me! (The Child of Prophecy is amazing! I can&#39;t wait to tell everyone! )</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Uh, Boggart? Shall I rub your back?</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> No need! You are not to touch me ever again from now on! What sort of wife throws her husband out of his castle on their wedding night!?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The rumors spread overnight.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> A princess of iron who made even Lord Boggart kneel. She was strong, gentle, and somewhat eccentric.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> It was the arrival of a heretofore unseen Fairy Knight, they said.</p><p><strong>Fairies Gathered in the Tavern:</strong> I&#39;m telling you, Sheffield&#39;s been reborn, ever since Lady Mash came here!</p><p><strong>Fairies Gathered in the Tavern:</strong> Not only can she fight off the Mors, she&#39;s happy to help with anything,</p><p><strong>Fairies Gathered in the Tavern:</strong> but best of all, she scolds Lord Boggart if he gets too violent! Thanks to her, the old Lord Boggart is back!</p><p><strong>Fairies Gathered in the Tavern:</strong> This way, we won&#39;t lose to the Queen&#39;s army! We will take Norwich back!</p><p><strong>D：Wag Toasting with Everyone:</strong> Three cheers for Lady Mash! Three cheers for Lord Boggart!</p><p><strong>D：Wag Toasting with Everyone:</strong> Three cheers for our very own knight—for the Knight of Sheffield!</p><p><strong>Fairies &amp; Wag:</strong> Hip hip, hooray!</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> ...Man, Wag sure doesn&#39;t have a care in the world. Knight of Sheffield, my ass.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Mash is the Child of Prophecy, not just a knight for this town.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> I mean, the princess dress is nice, but...it&#39;s something special, after all.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> If you ask us, Mash looks elegant even wearing that iron armor of hers...</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> You jealous of Boggart, Rob? You&#39;re the ones who brought her here.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Of course not, it&#39;s just weird how the people here keep putting her on a pedestal!</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> ...Not that we didn&#39;t do the same thing.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Every morning, I see Mash on top of the castle walls, looking off into the distance.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> ...She seems so lonely. Like she&#39;s unhappy, even though she&#39;s always smiling.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> I have to wonder if we might have made a mistake in bringing her here.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> ...Hmm.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Then you think she might not be the Child of Prophecy, Rob?</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> ...Hm. We just picked her up off the side of the road at first. To begin with she was...well, just another piece of merchandise.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> And despite that, we had feelings for her before we knew it. We talked with her like she was one of us.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> ...Wag and me aren&#39;t from the Fairy Kingdom. We&#39;re just fairies from somewhere else that washed ashore.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> They call us flotsam. Objects, humans, fairies...</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> It just happens sometimes. We&#39;re Changelings like that.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> (Flotsam? I&#39;ve never heard of this...but I guess that&#39;s what happens under Morgan&#39;s rule. )</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> We don&#39;t belong to any clan, and we aren&#39;t Nature Spirits either. So there&#39;s no place for us.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Her Majesty Morgan&#39;s soldiers will capture you, draw Command Spells on you, and then leave you for dead.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Even if they leave you be, at the end of the year you will die when your tax is squeezed out.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Killing isn&#39;t necessary. That&#39;s why I was desperate to do whatever jobs I could find.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Wag&#39;s just that kind of guy. No matter what&#39;s happening, he&#39;s just oblivious...</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Well, I&#39;m the older brother, so I gotta take care of him.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Every year, survival became the only thing I cared about. I guess I have that to thank for why I haven&#39;t turned into a Mors yet, then.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Well, I forgot a few things in exchange. Hesitation. Wonderment. Compassion.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Before I knew it, I started thinking of myself as a legitimate scoundrel, and just did whatever I wanted.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> That would have been easy enough.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> With that girl though, I knew I hadn&#39;t forgotten.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> ...the Child of Prophecy will save the fairies of the Fairy Kingdom. We&#39;re just outcasts. It doesn&#39;t matter to us.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> So maybe she&#39;s not the real deal. The Child of Prophecy won&#39;t save us.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Annis is but a fake...she&#39;s something more than the Child of Prophecy...</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Maybe then, you&#39;re still in town because—</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> What do you know, idiot!? Get the hell out of here! You&#39;re just the princess&#39; tailor! Quit selling your bullshit!</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> That&#39;s right. I&#39;m Habetrot the Seamstress, friend of all brides.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Leave guarding Mash to me. If we&#39;re ever in trouble, I&#39;ll come to you first.</p><p><strong>D：Rowdy Fairies &amp; Wag:</strong> Yeah! Who&#39;s afraid of the Queen or the Mors!? We&#39;ll protect Mash!</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> ...Sigh. You were right after all, Winky.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> If we had parted sooner, none of this would...? Winky? Hey, where&#39;d he go?</p><p><strong>Fairy Guardsman:</strong> Lord Boggart. The 4th Platoon has returned from Edinburgh.</p><p><strong>Fairy Guardsman:</strong> They were unable to meet with Knocknarea personally, but negotiations went smoothly.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> We&#39;ve managed to get the iron weapons. Send the weapons to the fairies, and the armor to the humans&#39; barracks.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> The humans will assist the fairy soldiers with their presence.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> I don&#39;t expect much from their raw strength. It&#39;s enough if they avoid dying.</p><p><strong>Fairy Guardsman:</strong> Sir. I&#39;ll have the tailor fit your armor right away.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Has the Child of Prophecy gone into town again? I thought I told her to stay by the throne.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> A lord&#39;s wife should not be so thoughtless. Who is giving her these ideas? Is it Habetrot?</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> She thinks she can push her luck just because she&#39;s useful as a tailor. Tell her there won&#39;t be a next time, even in regards to the Child of Prophecy.</p><p><strong>Fairy Guardsman:</strong> Ah, well...</p><p><strong>Fairy Guardsman:</strong> Lady Mash said she wanted to be helpful to Lord Boggart in her own way.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Only those who obey are of any use to me!</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> In Sheffield, I am the law! No matter the reason, the punishment for disobedience is death!</p><p><strong>Fairy Guardsman:</strong> Aaaah...!</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Heya, I heard you got your hands on some weapons? I just came to check if you got a bunch of garbage or not!</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Hm? What, is Boggart in a mood again?</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Are you upset that Mash isn&#39;t here? I see, I see, Mash is real strong after all.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> I heard troops are on their way here from New Darlington.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Does the great rebel lord want his wife by his side to protect him?</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> I need no one&#39;s protection! I don&#39;t want to be bothered by having that girl anywhere near me!</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Then, it doesn&#39;t matter where Mash is! ☆</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> As far as you&#39;re concerned, all you need is for her to be in Sheffield, right?</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> ...tch. You don&#39;t know when to shut up. I&#39;d twist your head off if I could replace you.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Very well. The Child of Prophecy can do as she pleases during the day hours.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> But you&#39;re taking quite the tone with me, Habetrot. I expect you&#39;ve brought some appropriate results.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> The iron cylinder that was brought in with that girl...it&#39;s similar to the spear Morgan carries.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Can you figure out its inner workings? Is it something we can make use of?</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> ...I don&#39;t know how it works, but if you just want to shoot it, that should be fine.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> I can tell that&#39;s not its original purpose, though...somehow, just touching it makes me feel sick.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> I think it&#39;s a weapon that shouldn&#39;t exist in this world...</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Mash, why do you have something like that...it really doesn&#39;t suit you at all...</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Indeed. She never mentions the cylinder.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Perhaps she&#39;s unconsciously avoiding it.... you could even say she&#39;s trying to escape it.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Wow, that&#39;s pretty perceptive for you, Boggart. I&#39;m of the same opinion, but let&#39;s be honest—</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> I don&#39;t care about the Child of Prophecy. Can it be used as a weapon?</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Well, yeah. I mean, it&#39;s a cannon. Do you know what that is? No?</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> You put a bullet, or magical energy in this case, in the chamber, compress it, and with combustion it&#39;s forcibly expelled.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> But it sucks up a lot of magical energy. The fairy who shoots it will likely succumb to fatigue.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> If you want to make use of it, do so yourself, Boggart. Don&#39;t force it on your soldiers.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> It&#39;s not something your average fairy can withstand.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> So you&#39;re saying it&#39;s only to be used by the strong?</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Hmph. How appropriate. A good representation of my ability as king.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Guess there&#39;s nothing you can say to someone with a rock for a brain...</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> More importantly, about what I said before...</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> The Queen&#39;s army is coming here. Are you ready for them?</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> As the lord of this city, what countermeasures do you have planned?</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Thanks to our supporters in Camelot, we know who we&#39;ll be facing.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> It&#39;s the Queen&#39;s 3rd Division.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> About 2,000 men. The Queen probably judged that as sufficient.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> —hah.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Hahahahaha! How naive of her!</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> They won&#39;t even get past Sheffield&#39;s walls.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Our walls are made from bark peeled off the World Tree. They can&#39;t be destroyed so easily.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Without Fairy Knights, the Queen&#39;s soldiers pose no threat. I&#39;ll let them wear themselves out against the castle walls.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Now that Knocknarea is prepared to head south, the Queen doesn&#39;t have the luxury of sending reinforcements.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Seven days. If we hold out for seven days, the 3rd Division won&#39;t have the strength to keep up the siege.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> After that it&#39;s up to me and my elite. We&#39;ll unleash all the resentment we built up during that time.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> I see, you&#39;ve thought this through. I&#39;ve got no need to worry.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> So have you told Mash this is going to turn into a battleground in the next few days yet?</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> In terms of fighting strength, she&#39;s on par with a Fairy Knight. Aren&#39;t you going to tell her?</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> No. How many times must I tell you? She&#39;s not needed!</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> The Child of Prophecy only needs to raise the morale of the troops. Anything else is a distraction.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Don&#39;t presume too much, Habetrot. She&#39;s nothing more than window dressing.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Good evening, Lord Boggart. I see you&#39;ve come to see me tonight as well.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> I didn&#39;t come because I wanted to. The gate guards are nearby, I had no choice.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> It&#39;s a disgrace for a member of the Fang Clan to visit the chambers of a woman he doesn&#39;t even embrace...</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> It&#39;s against my principles to waste time. Tonight is...</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Let&#39;s discuss the Child of Prophecy. I&#39;m told you have no memories, but how much do you know?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I&#39;m sorry. A fairy turning 16 this year, who will save Britain. That&#39;s all I know.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> —How crude. This goes beyond even a lack of knowledge.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> ...It was 16 years ago now.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> The head of the Mirror Clan, Ainsel, possessed the Sacrament of being able to predict the future.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> “A savior that will save Britain has been born. In due time, a true king will appear to defeat the false king. ”</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> That was her prophecy.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Queen Morgan rounded up all the fairies born that year and executed them, but her purge was incomplete.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> There are many villages that hide their opposition to her.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Some of them sent away their newborn fairies, entrusting their hopes to them.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> That being the case, there were also towns which raised fairies that year, in an attempt to bring about the Child of Prophecy.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Or perhaps they wanted to present them to the Queen 16 years later...like a neatly wrapped gift.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Whatever the case, the “Child of Prophecy” is very valuable, even by itself. Every faction was searching frantically for it.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Nobody doubted Ainsel&#39;s prophecy.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Why, you ask? Because they knew the precedent. There will be a savior born in Britain.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> One to purify the great calamity every 1,000 years...one who can sing with the voice of paradise.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> However, records from the Fairy Calendar are lost to us. There are only two things that remain.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> The first is from the year 4000 of the Fairy Calendar. That would be more than 6,000 years ago.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> When Britain was on the verge of collapse due to a war between the clans, a single fairy brought about salvation, at the cost of their own life.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> The second is the Summer War in the year 2000 of the Fairy Calendar. The war with the northern fairies who came ashore from the Island of Shadows.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Our ancestors were driven to the brink of extinction by iron-wielding soldiers led by Queen Mab.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Once again, a single fairy stepped between both sides, subdued the conflict, and laid the foundation for the six clans of the present day.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> The name of this savior was “Tonelico”.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> After stopping the war between the clans, the savior was laid to rest in the lands furthest to Britain&#39;s north, the shunned land of Orkney.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> ...Hrm. The ignorant masses claim that the “Child of Prophecy” is the reincarnation of that savior, but...</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> I don&#39;t care either way. No matter how many times they save Britain, in the end, we cannot win.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Because the Calamities still come back. You can hardly call them a “Savior”.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> If those abominable Mors and the incessant Calamities had vanished along with them, then I&#39;d permit them that name.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...“Calamity. ” Everyone in this town fears that word as well.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No, even before we came here, fairies in every city feared it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No matter how ruthless Queen Morgan is, she has quelled the Calamities up until now.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s why you need to follow her, even though you fear her. I guess...</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> That&#39;s right. Morgan declared that she was forsaking Norwich.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> The perfect opportunity. The first huge gap in the Queen&#39;s defenses revealing itself since Tristan&#39;s designation as heir.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...? Lord Boggart, are you pleased?</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> One needs a reason to raise an army. Rather, to recruit troops, you need a cause.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Norwich is a unique opportunity, Mash, for me to take the throne for myself.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> I have no intention of saving Norwich. But I will make good use of it.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> My declaration is a simple one. The restoration of Norwich and the elimination of the “Calamity Pool”.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Until those are fulfilled, Sheffield will not obey Camelot.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> The Queen will to have to accept my conditions, or suppress Sheffield&#39;s army.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> To tell the truth, it doesn&#39;t matter what she does. Her armies will be exhausted either way.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> In the meantime, by colluding with the fairies of the north and joining arms with the Round Table Army in the south,</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> I will raise an army of my own, one to rival the Queen&#39;s.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> You are the catalyst of that cause, “Child of Prophecy”. I do not expect you to save Britain, or anything of the sort.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Understand? The fact that you remember nothing matters not.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> At best, keep up appearances for the hope of the people.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> For someone like you, that&#39;s about as much as you are good for.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> —</p><p><strong>Hooded Fairy:</strong> ...that&#39;s the current state of things in Sheffield.</p><p><strong>Hooded Fairy:</strong> There&#39;s about 3,000 of Boggart&#39;s soldiers, 2,000 assorted fairies, and 300 humans.</p><p><strong>Hooded Fairy:</strong> They&#39;re still steadily gathering forces now, so...won&#39;t they become more of a problem, the more time we give them?</p><p><strong>Queen&#39;s Army・Knight:</strong> ...Seems like it.</p><p><strong>Queen&#39;s Army・Knight:</strong> Shit. Her Majesty gave Sheffield dispensation to assemble military force to prepare against the northern fairies, but...</p><p><strong>Queen&#39;s Army・Knight:</strong> To assemble 5,000 rebels...We&#39;ve never had an insurrection on this scale before.</p><p><strong>Hooded Fairy:</strong> Seems like Lady Tristan&#39;s games have gone too far...</p><p><strong>Hooded Fairy:</strong> The number of fairies she&#39;s killed without reason since the founding of New Darlington has finally come to light.</p><p><strong>Hooded Fairy:</strong> All of Britain has doubts in both Lady Tristan,</p><p><strong>Hooded Fairy:</strong> and of Queen Morgan&#39;s judgement in knighting her, so...</p><p><strong>Queen&#39;s Army・Knight:</strong> Quell thy tongue...there is no need to state that which is so painfully obvious.</p><p><strong>Queen&#39;s Army・Knight:</strong> We swore an oath of allegiance to Her Majesty. Save your frivolous opinions.</p><p><strong>Hooded Fairy:</strong> Sorry for that...just a slip of the tongue.</p><p><strong>Hooded Fairy:</strong> So, what about my payment?</p><p><strong>Queen&#39;s Army・Knight:</strong> ...Fine. Hey, pay him.</p><p><strong>Queen&#39;s Army・Knight:</strong> He may have lost his position, but Boggart is still a Fang Clan head. He&#39;s worth more than a thousand fairies on his own.</p><p><strong>Queen&#39;s Army・Knight:</strong> Send word to Camelot as soon as possible, so that we may obtain Lord Gawain&#39;s aid.</p><p><strong>Hooded Fairy:</strong> ...What about the Child of Prophecy? That was the crown jewel of my tip-off.</p><p><strong>Queen&#39;s Army・Knight:</strong> Don&#39;t make me laugh. We caught one of those yesterday.</p><p><strong>Queen&#39;s Army・Knight:</strong> It&#39;s probably just Boggart&#39;s entourage, and as such, it&#39;s not even worth confirming.</p><p><strong>Voice from Behind the Tent:</strong> Oh, I&#39;m not so sure that is strictly true, Officer.</p><p><strong>Voice from Behind the Tent:</strong> There was no lie in his story. The part about the Child of Prophecy was especially good.</p><p><strong>Voice from Behind the Tent:</strong> “Black iron armor, a large shield, the appearance of a 16-year-old girl,” and—</p><p><strong>Voice from Behind the Tent:</strong> “A black iron cylinder that makes you uneasy just by looking at it,” was it?</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> Well well, now you&#39;ve got my attention. Tell me a little more, bro.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> Well? What&#39;s her name? You do know it, right?</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> You came here to sell some information, yet you&#39;ve conveniently left that part out.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> Bit shady, don&#39;t you think? I think you know, and yet you&#39;re choosing to not tell us.</p><p><strong>Hooded Fairy:</strong> ...Is that how it sounds? Sorry, but you&#39;re imagining things. I really don&#39;t know.</p><p><strong>Hooded Fairy:</strong> You&#39;ll have to excuse me, if there&#39;s no further payment. I&#39;d like to be back in the south by tomorrow.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> There&#39;s no need to rush. You&#39;ve come all this way, so why don&#39;t we take our time, and have a nice little chat?</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> Hey, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll remember soon enough, Winky. After all, that&#39;s what your expression is telling me.</p><h2 id="section-6-wales-i" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-6-wales-i" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 6: Wales (I)</h2><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s so peaceful...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Yeah.

As far as the redheaded dude is concerned at least, aren&#39;t ya?</p><p><strong>The Seventh Fairy:</strong> The lass just posed a different kind of danger, though.</p><p><strong>The Seventh Fairy:</strong> There was this huge bang, and we were almost killed, along with our guards.</p><p><strong>The Seventh Fairy:</strong> Follow the other little miss&#39; example, why don&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>The Seventh Fairy:</strong> She threw all kinds of stuff around too, but none of it came near us.</p><p><strong>The Seventh Fairy:</strong> It&#39;s alright to be rowdy, but be aware of your surroundings, okay?

Let&#39;s take this opportunity to discuss a few things, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> It&#39;ll be troublesome to explain if you say something like “I trusted you, but you were really my enemy all along?! ” later on.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...It&#39;s a long story, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> So you&#39;re saying, he&#39;s some kind of impure Servant produced by something called the Alien God?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> And before now, he&#39;s been Fujimaru&#39;s enemy...?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Pretty much. He did something especially extraordinary during our last moments in Olympus.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Muramasa. You&#39;re a powerful Servant who severed the Saint Graph of the Titan Atlas.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> And yet you failed your assassination attempt on Queen Morgan, and were defeated by another fairy entirely.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I&#39;m having a hard time believing that. Can you offer some sort of explanation?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> There&#39;s really nothing odd about it. I&#39;m an Alter Ego who specializes in slaying gods.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> The Alien God incorporated that kind of Divine Spirit into me.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Some kind of blind God of War, who brought about the Twilight of the Gods.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> The other god is...my dearest wish, or rather, my aspiration. Well, I&#39;d rather you don&#39;t ask me about that.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> What? It&#39;s not like I&#39;m especially strong. I just don&#39;t have to expend my magical energy when “slaying gods”.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> It was most suited for Olympus, but Scandinavia...well, it would have been another matter, I guess.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Scáthach-Skadi, right?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> If this Alter Ego of mine would have met her, I imagine she would have been pretty upset.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> If only that blind God of War hadn&#39;t been deceived...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Well, that about sums it up.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> In worlds where gods and Divine Spirits are prevalent, that&#39;s where I shine as an apostle, you know.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;re strong, so long as you&#39;re fighting gods...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Then conversely...</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...I see. I had a bit of an inkling, but you cleared it up.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> There&#39;s no concept of “religion” here. Meaning—</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Yeah. There aren&#39;t any gods in Britain.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> I don&#39;t know the particulars of how the world ended up this way though.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> A world dominated by fairies, but there&#39;s no sign of the greatest Mystery of them all: a god.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Well, isn&#39;t that to be expected? Don&#39;t only humans pray to the gods?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Fairies are all-powerful, so there&#39;s no need for them to seek salvation from beings greater than themselves.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Inevitably, the concept of “a god” will never come to exist in their society.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hmm...well, when you put it like that, it definitely makes sense...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...I&#39;ll have to compile some notes on all this later. I need Holmes&#39; take on this...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I don&#39;t really get all this “god” stuff, so I can&#39;t comment...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Muramasa, you&#39;re definitely Fujimaru&#39;s enemy, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> You saved us by coming along, but mutual enemies travelling together is...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> You don&#39;t need to worry, Artoria. Didn&#39;t I tell you in Gloucester?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Now that you saved me, I&#39;m part of the Child of Prophecy&#39;s retinue. That&#39;s easier for me.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> I don&#39;t want to nitpick my job, but...this way, I can finally get motivated.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You don&#39;t like working for the Alien God?</p><hr><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Of course not, it&#39;s all a bit of a bad joke, if you ask me!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> I don&#39;t even know who or what this “Alien God” is!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Summoning me and fusing a bunch of stuff into me without my consent, then unilaterally compelling me to do its dirty work.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> I&#39;m an arms dealer, so I don&#39;t really want to comment on good and evil at this point, but...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> When I was alive, as someone sworn to the Buddha, I couldn&#39;t perform any heretical work.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Well, I&#39;m fused with a bunch of other things now. There&#39;s no right or wrong to speak of.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> That&#39;s why I do what I have to do, in order to get the job done. As Muramasa, it&#39;s the least I can do.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Yeah. Muramasa was that kind of Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Well. If I were true to the Heroic Spirit Muramasa, it&#39;d be without doubt.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> As you can see, I&#39;m but a more humble Muramasa. But I&#39;m useful in my own way.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> So now you&#39;re saying you took the job to help Artoria?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> ...well, that&#39;s what I meant.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> What? What are you smirking at me for? You&#39;re kind of a brat, you know that?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I see. Well, if that&#39;s the case, we&#39;ll put our trust in you as well.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> We need as much strength as we can get, and if it&#39;s from a Heroic Spirit we know already, then all the better.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Nice to be working with you, Senji Muramasa. Even if it&#39;s only during this Lostbelt, I&#39;m glad to have you with us.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Yeah. After all, you&#39;ve already paid in full, so I&#39;ll gladly lend you a hand, no strings attached.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> ...Well, that aside...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> I don&#39;t really want to ask, but we were associates, after all...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> What was Limbo&#39;s death like?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It was the worst.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It sucked.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It was the right thing to do.</p><hr><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> ...I see.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Alright!

It was absurdly strong...</p><p><strong>Red Rabbit:</strong> Was that not a fairy bitten by a Black Dog, driven mad by the pain?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Is that different from the Mors?</p><p><strong>Red Rabbit:</strong> Yes. When fairies become Mors, they lose their purpose, their brilliance, and become “meaningless,”</p><p><strong>Red Rabbit:</strong> and the fact that such “meaninglessness” is contagious when touching Mors is the cause.</p><p><strong>Red Rabbit:</strong> On the other hand, a fairy who becomes so absorbed in their purpose that they lose sight of themselves will continue to generate magical energy without end,</p><p><strong>Red Rabbit:</strong> to the point that they will be unable to maintain their form. I suppose you could call them evil fairies.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> The fairies of the Nameless Forest were like that...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> When they got hold of a human, they lost control of their inhibitions, and in the end they all killed each other.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What&#39;s a Black Dog?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Evil fairies that devour their own kind.

We&#39;ll probably stay here a few days, so let&#39;s set up camp.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Now that we&#39;re here, I can&#39;t help but worry about what&#39;s going on outside.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Let&#39;s get some rest for now and wait for Oberon to come back.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p>~After dinner~</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You know, I&#39;ve wondered for a while now...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> When it comes to fairies, what is the structure of “family” like?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I saw relationships like brothers and sisters in Salisbury, but I didn&#39;t see any of parents and children.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Of course you didn&#39;t. All fairies are born independently, after all.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Fairies with similar attributes will refer to each other as siblings,</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> or, as in the case of the “seven fairies” we saw yesterday, they could have been a “set of seven” since they were born.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I suppose that&#39;s just what it is to be a fairy.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Then what about “daughters? ”</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I heard that Fairy Knight Tristan is Morgan&#39;s daughter, so how does that work?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Hahaha, Tristan isn&#39;t Morgan&#39;s daughter! It just means she&#39;s the heir to the throne.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> In human terms, you could say Morgan adopted Tristan.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Among fairies, their “daughters” and “sons” are actually those born in the “next generation” to come after their own deaths.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Let&#39;s see...Hm, for example: let&#39;s say there&#39;s a “spool fairy A”.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Having lived for 100 years, “spool fairy A” has fulfilled their purpose and will go to sleep.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> But the position of a “spool fairy” and the way of being one will not have disappeared from Britain.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> After the passing of “spool fairy A,” a “spool fairy B” will be born in Britain.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> This relationship is simply called the “previous generation” and the “current generation”.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I see. So then what is passed on to this new generation?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> As humans, we inherit our genes, records, names, our family tree, and so on...</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Yes. Fairies are born independently, so there is no such connection.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> The “previous generation” and the “current generation” are completely different fairies. A “record”, or...maybe “stories”, “memories,” well...</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Fairies who are powerful enough could be able to continue something like that, but it&#39;s basically still a brand new “next” part to it.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Even so, if their positions are the same, their abilities and appearance would be similar between generations too.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> That&#39;s why no matter where or when they were born, a fairy will always know whether they are a “spool fairy”.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> In some cases, even though the “current generation” is still alive, a new fairy who resembles them is born.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> These are rare instances, but in those cases, the new fairy could be considered the “son” or “daughter” of the current generation.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> That&#39;s why fairies who are able to use magecraft are called “Morgan&#39;s daughters”.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> In this Britain, the only ones who are able to use magecraft are Queen Morgan,</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Tristan, who was given the ability as her successor,</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> and Artoria, who has been able to use it since she was born.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Those two would seem, to the rest of the fairies, to both be of the same nature as the queen...hence they are called “Morgan&#39;s daughters”.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> ...So, that&#39;s why...that Fairy Knight was so hostile toward the Child of Prophecy.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> There&#39;s a rumor going around...that the Child of Prophecy is the daughter of Her Majesty...</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> That&#39;s not quite the case, Artoria.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> It&#39;s not because she is Morgan&#39;s daughter that she is able to use magecraft. It&#39;s because a fairy who wields magecraft can become the next ruler of the Fairy Kingdom.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> That&#39;s how I think it is. That&#39;s why Morgan gave Tristan the ability to use magecraft.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Something like, “you&#39;ll be the next Queen, so you can lay waste to Britain as you please. ”</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> This is probably Morgan&#39;s way of “breaking the prophecy,” to not let the throne fall into the hands of the Child of Prophecy.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> But the truth of the matter is, you were born with magecraft. So to Morgan—</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> No, to Tristan, it&#39;s like “there&#39;s no way the real one showed up now! ”</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Perhaps the reason she was panicking at the auction house, was because she couldn&#39;t stand the fear of what could happen?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> ...I-is that so. Do I...make people scared...</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Perhaps. Either way, the conflict between you and Tristan isn&#39;t one that will be avoidable.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> But don&#39;t worry about it. Let&#39;s just take it easy.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> When you use your magecraft, you are the Child of Prophecy, the one destined to defeat the queen.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> No matter how strong Morgan is, or how powerful the Fairy Knights are.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> As long as you are the Child of Prophecy, you are the protagonist of Britain right now.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> If you do all that is required of you, ultimately, the prophecy will come true.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> We&#39;re just here to help you achieve that. In the end, if you are the one still standing, Britain will be saved.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> —Even if we lose a few people along the way.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...No good, I can&#39;t sleep at all...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Can&#39;t sleep because you have too much on your mind, huh?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Ah, sit down. You don&#39;t have to get up.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I saw you all alone, before I left to gather information.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Do you mind if I sit next to you? Great, then I&#39;ll help myself.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Well then. Do you want to talk about everything that&#39;s happened, just to take your mind off things?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> The story of everything before you arrived in this Lostbelt. The long, long story of your journey here.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I see. So that&#39;s the story of yours and Chaldea&#39;s journey.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> The future of Earth, the survival of mankind, all the Lostbelts up until now, and the person in front of me here and now.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Yeah, I wouldn&#39;t be able to sleep with all that either. Especially not that last bit.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> You feel guilty about the “Child of Prophecy”.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> No, I think “left out” is what you feel.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Artoria will shed a lot of blood going forward. But none of it will be on your hands.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Until now, you have been the one who had to do that. That&#39;s why you could fight, even if it was difficult.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> No, that&#39;s why you had to fight. Because the burden was all on you.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> But not this time. You have to leave it to others...you have no choice but to leave it all to Artoria.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> So you don&#39;t know what to think or feel.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> You might even think of yourself as a coward in this Lostbelt.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> “We don&#39;t actually have any intention of saving this Fairy Kingdom,” you said.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s—</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...maybe...that is the case...</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> “Our missing teammate is what&#39;s most important. If anything happens to Mash, it would be my responsibility. ” Right?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Oh? Surprised, are you? I can tell if you&#39;re pretending to be alright.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> But, you know...</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Down the line, if Mash dies in an accident while alone in the streets, is that really your fault?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Because you didn&#39;t watch and protect her all the time?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> It wouldn&#39;t be. That&#39;s not worrying for her. That&#39;s just self-criticism and self-harm.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Mash is a human being, and it&#39;s in humanity&#39;s nature to be able to lead their own lives.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> If you respect her and see her as an equal, then you shouldn&#39;t worry so much about her, but trust in her.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Taking on the burden all on your own won&#39;t do anyone any good. When the crucial moment comes, you&#39;ll be too weighed down to act.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> ...Well, from what you told me about your journey so far, it doesn&#39;t seem like your mind is getting any lighter.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> You&#39;ve always been much less grounded.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> You&#39;re the kind that lives life on your own terms, aren&#39;t you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Live on my own terms...?</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Yeah, living the way you want doesn&#39;t mean living without hardships.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> What you enjoy, what you desire most.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Fighting for them with all your heart, pushing yourself for the things you love, that&#39;s what living life on your own terms is all about.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> That&#39;s what was going on during the Incineration of the Human Order. Well, not like I was there to witness it, right?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> In a way, the two of us are alike. You could say...we have the same role here in Britain.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> We&#39;re just bystanders. Unfortunately, neither you nor I are the main characters of this story.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Just like the Fairy King Oberon in “A Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream”.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> The only thing we can do is watch. Support those who have to rush into battle for us.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> But that doesn&#39;t mean you have to beat yourself up.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> After all, there will definitely be a moment where you have to do what&#39;s necessary.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> The kind of moment where there&#39;s no one else by you, with something only you can do, and it will turn the tables.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Doesn&#39;t that sound cool? But for the time being, we&#39;ll have to be patient and continue to look forward to that moment.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> What&#39;s wrong with “just being a bystander”!? Even the audience plays their part!</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> At the very end, we have to show them the grand play that even God himself wouldn&#39;t have seen coming!</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Revealing the tip of fate seems like it&#39;ll be a lot of fun!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Pfft, That&#39;s just like you, Oberon!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Thank you. I&#39;m feeling a lot better.</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> There&#39;s no such thing as too crazy. That&#39;s what I&#39;ve always lived by!</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> ...Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> There aren&#39;t many people that can explain exactly what kind of person they are.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Unlike a tool with a clear instruction manual, we&#39;re living beings. We&#39;re born uncertain.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> But you know, everyone knows that there&#39;s at least one thing that they&#39;re good at.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I&#39;m embarrassed to say this, but,</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> in this instance, I don&#39;t really think I&#39;m a coward. Of course, neither are you.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Oops. Sorry Blanca. I got carried away whilst chatting.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> We should gather intel on Manchester tonight. It&#39;s finally time to gather information about the north.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Well, that&#39;s it from me. I&#39;ll see you again tomorrow night, I don&#39;t want to be left without dinner, after all.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> [♂ Wait up. /♀ Wait. ]</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Hmm?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What exactly is your purpose, Oberon?</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> To overthrow Morgan, of course. It&#39;s not really my part, but that&#39;s why I was summoned.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Hm, not because of the Human Order, or something along those lines? Ah, that&#39;s what you&#39;re asking about.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I didn&#39;t want to tell you...but I can&#39;t pretend that I want something great like what I just said.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> —Yeah. I&#39;m looking for Titania.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> The one I told you about. Oberon&#39;s queen in “A Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream”.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Titania, the Fairy Queen. The only one who could love the eccentric Oberon.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> If possible, I&#39;d really like to meet her in person.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Though—it&#39;s probably a pipedream.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Titania is a fictional fairy. She doesn&#39;t exist in pan-human history.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Yeah, she was an existence permitted only within fiction.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Ow, ow ow ow...!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Come on! I said it was just a light spar, but Muramasa treated it so seriously!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> That&#39;s because I&#39;m old. I have to give the young&#39;uns a hard time without any mercy.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> It doesn&#39;t look like Fujimaru needs any more of a hard time though.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> The unfolding of the battle in relation to simple summoning, that&#39;s very important.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> It would be better for me to guard you than to go out into battle.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> With the right strategy, you might even be able to beat a Fairy Knight!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> A Fairy Knight....</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Could you do it?</p><hr><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Oh, if I use everything I&#39;ve got and expend all my magical energy, then I could!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> They&#39;ve beaten you to a pulp before, huh? Well, this time it&#39;s our turn.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> As the strongest here, the Fairy Knights are not to be feared, I tell ya!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Mmh.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Muramasa, your weapons are made of iron, right? Could I have some of the materials?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> No, sorry, but I&#39;m the only one who can use these. Like, they&#39;ve been paid for in advance with my magical energy.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> If you want to use them, you&#39;ll have to prepare them from scratch by yourself.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> If you want iron, the only way to get that is for you to head to the mines. Norwich is in charge of those, right?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I see...then I guess I&#39;ll have to find it elsewhere...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> (I finally thought of a way to defeat Gawain, and yet...)</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> What, you look like you&#39;re scheming something. Want a hand with it?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I don&#39;t! Stick to Fujimaru, gramps!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> —</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Artoria has entered her rebellious phase, hasn&#39;t she? Or is that just the way she&#39;s always been?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Maybe, she&#39;s just a sore loser.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Maybe, she doesn&#39;t like having Muramasa as her grandpa.</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> That&#39;s wrong, I&#39;m just acting like the Child of Prophecy!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I&#39;m the Child of Prophecy after all! So I&#39;m going to be very serious from now on!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Serious from now on?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You&#39;ve always been serious. There isn&#39;t anyone who thinks you haven&#39;t been.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Haha. Is this because of what Oberon said last night? How he said a direct confrontation with that Fairy Knight is inevitable.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> That&#39;s right...but...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> ...I can&#39;t be lost forever.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I don&#39;t really get the feeling of being on a pilgrimage to save Britain or to ring the bells, but...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> ...Gloucester, and all the fairies we met along the way, are all expecting it to happen.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Even in the village where I was born, Tintagel, they all believed in me, and so they sent me on this journey.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I&#39;m not sure if I can meet everyone&#39;s expectations, and that&#39;s what I worry about the most...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> That&#39;s why! I thought I&#39;d start off by proudly announcing “I am the Child of Prophecy! ”</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> W-w-well, I just have the spirit of hit-or-miss, I don&#39;t have any concrete ideas...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> What&#39;s up with that? You sound like a little girl who can&#39;t decide whether she&#39;s brave or cowardly.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Yeah, exactly.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (I can&#39;t afford to lose my way either. )</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I too, will partake regardless of Chaldea&#39;s mission.</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m here to help you, Artoria.</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> B-but what about Mash!?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> The only reason we&#39;re on the same team right now is because we&#39;re searching for Mash.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Of course we&#39;ll still look for Mash. That part is obvious.</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> But on top of that, I want to help the Child of Prophecy too.</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> —</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I agree. We weren&#39;t clear on our position before.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Searching for Mash is our top priority, but that doesn&#39;t mean we leave Britain to fend for itself.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> We&#39;re not working with you for Mash&#39;s sake, we&#39;re working with you for Britain&#39;s sake.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I want to leave this country with a smile after I&#39;ve helped the friends I&#39;ve made along the way, so I can be pleased with myself.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Isn&#39;t that what all of this is about, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yes!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Even though I&#39;m sure the new Director will scold me.</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yeah, I agree! In the end, even Gordolf would say the same thing!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> That means—not only Muramasa,</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> but Fujimaru and da Vinci, will also accompany me on my pilgrimage?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> And of course, Oberon, who isn&#39;t here right now, as well. Our victory will be rewarded handsomely, after all☆</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> How about it, future King? If it bothers you, we can always part ways.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> No—not at all! You&#39;re all welcomed! I would have never even dreamed of this!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> The first alliance as the Child of Prophecy! Wow, somehow I actually seem like a king! Yay!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yeah, you really seem like a king.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (I&#39;m glad you&#39;re so happy with this! )</p><hr><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Well, even if we&#39;re excited, that doesn&#39;t change the fact that we don&#39;t know what to do.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> It&#39;s good that you&#39;re motivated as the Child of Prophecy. But seriously, what are we supposed to do now?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Ghh, the reality of it makes me want to die...!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Let me be happy for now at least, just for this moment, Muramasaaaa!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> No, as the oldest one here, I have to offer a different view, don&#39;t I?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I&#39;ve heard your conversation. Hm, if that is the case, I have a suggestion.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That voice—</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Oberon!</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon? :</strong> The time has come earlier than expected. Now is the time to show the Child of Prophecy what she must do.</p><p><strong>Oberon? :</strong> This is where we must be headed. The fork in the road of destiny, the trial that will prove the rumors of the Child of Prophecy once and for all...</p><p><strong>Oberon? :</strong> Yes! It&#39;s time to go save Norwich!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I can hear your voice, but I can&#39;t see you at all!? Oberon, is that really you, Oberon!?</p><p><strong>Oberon? :</strong> Huh? What&#39;s with that reaction. Ah, I see. That&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Oberon? :</strong> Everyone, down, below you. Look further down.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Phew. Long distance traveling is very tiresome. But I had to see the intel with my own eyes.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Hello, everyone, is it the first time you&#39;ve seen me like this?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> The miniature, dapper speedster, who travels around Britain on a Mach-speed Hawk-moth.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> The Fairy King riding in the hand of Robin Goodfellow, Rider Oberon, that&#39;s me!</p><p><strong>Everyone else:</strong> You—</p><p><strong>Everyone else:</strong> You&#39;re so tiny!?</p><h2 id="section-7-fragment-4-sheffield-ii" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-7-fragment-4-sheffield-ii" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 7: Fragment / 4 - Sheffield (II)</h2><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Military boots resounded across the northern lands, as the Queen&#39;s army continued their march forward.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> In amongst the vanguard of the army heading for Sheffield, the standard of “Black Flame and Fortress” was fluttering.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Fairy Knight Gawain was advancing towards Sheffield.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Her goal was neither to suppress the rebels, nor to negotiate with Boggart.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Beryl Gut, who had joined them yesterday as the Queen&#39;s representative, gave a broad grin.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> It was just one day before the city of Sheffield would disappear from Britain.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Lord Boggart, have you still not gotten any rest?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I would like to ask if something is troubling you.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Hmph. You can&#39;t even pour me a drink? What a useless wife you are.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Well, either way, it&#39;s not as if I am familiar with the taste of alcohol. I don&#39;t really understand mankind&#39;s cuisine in general.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> To exercise one&#39;s ingenuity, and go through the trouble of complicating the flavor of meat. To me, it is a meaningless waste of time.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> The Fang Clan has no need for the likes of humans, let alone restaurants...</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Haven&#39;t you heard? The city of Oxford is brimming with restaurants.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Everywhere you look, there&#39;s one of Woodwose&#39;s restaurants. Like a poor joke taken too far.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Imagine if all the shops on the main street of Sheffield were restaurants.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> You would likely laugh out of sheer astonishment.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s.... yes. It would be rather strange and laughable.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Indeed. It&#39;s nothing more than an amusing appearance. At some point, I will have to show you—</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> ...No. Forget it. There&#39;s indeed something wrong with me.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> “Child of Prophecy”. You exterminated Mors at the request of the townspeople.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Soldiers witnessed you fighting in that armor. This in spite of me telling you not to stand out.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. I apologize. I&#39;m unfit to be Lord Boggart&#39;s bride.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> That has always been the case, you fool.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> You are capable of fighting the Mors, but you fear carrying a weapon.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> You didn&#39;t come back for the “Iron Cylinder”.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> I heard of it from the merchants. They found you with that “Iron Cylinder”.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> But not once have you mentioned it. As if you want to forget about it.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> That thing can rival Morgan&#39;s Holy Lance.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Why are you running from such power?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I do not know. But that “Iron Cylinder” is going to make everyone....</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I have a feeling that it&#39;s going to hurt Britain itself...that is what frightens me.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> No.... You aren&#39;t just scared of that “Cylinder”.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> You fear battle itself—</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> No, never mind. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever know what your true feelings are.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Only records and achievements shall be considered. Your memories from before coming here have yet to return, is that so?</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Whether it&#39;s your calling or not, you are without a doubt a knight. You&#39;ve known battle for a long time.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> But I don&#39;t remember seeing you in the Queen&#39;s army, nor was the appointment of a new Fairy Knight ever mentioned.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> I&#39;ve never seen a fairy like you. Where did you come from?</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Are you really...are you really the Child of the Prophecy who will save Britain?</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> If so, then your destination will be nothing other than a battlefield. The pilgrimage of “The Child of Prophecy” is built on a path of war and blood.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Would you be capable of such a feat? Not merely to overthrow the Queen, but to seize control and rule over all six clans by force?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s...that&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Hmph, you couldn&#39;t. Even should your memory return, you are unfit for this.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Fairies live for the sake of their purpose. What will you do if it&#39;s something you do not want?</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> You are not the Child of Prophecy, after all. You are merely a mislead imitation, a lost child.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> I have known battle for a long time. Ever since I was born, I have been fighting against the Mors.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> The Fang Clan has fought Mors and suppressed them. They are the most powerful Clan in Britain.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Woodwose and I were the strongest of them all. I couldn&#39;t tell you how many times we saved Britain from the Mors.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> For our service, Woodwose was made Lord of Oxford, and I of Norwich.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So I&#39;ve heard. Lord Boggart was the Lord of Norwich.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But, what brought you to Sheffield?</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> I was done in by a man named Capless. He has since taken the name Spriggan.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> No, enough talk about a low-lives like him. It is not for you to hear.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Do you know about the Caterpillar Wars of 200 years ago? The only war in which the Queen gave off a womanly shriek.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Fufu. How very unlike you to be afraid of insects, Morgan.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> During that war, Morgan granted the knightly title of Gawain to ■■■■■■■■.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> It is impossible to further recall her name, due to the Queen&#39;s True Name Redesignation.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Until Gawain is defeated, no one can utter her original fairy name.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Woodwose persecuted ■■■■■■■■ for being the daughter of that abominable Black Dog, but I came to admire her strength.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> In a sense...I am also somewhat responsible for that thing becoming a Fairy Knight.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> “If you don&#39;t want to be called a dog, don&#39;t fight with your claws and fangs. ”</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> “■■■■■■■■. Child of noble blood. You shall fight with your sword—your great horn. ”</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> She took a liking to my words, and has since carried her sword. Soon after, did the Queen recognize her as a knight.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> She became a Fairy Knight, and volunteered herself to be the shield to protect the fairies from the Mors.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Perhaps because she herself was despised as the daughter of a Black Dog...</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> She came to understand the feelings of the weak and sought the responsibility of being strong.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> The Queen referred to it as “noblesse oblige”. Good grief, I wasn&#39;t even aware of that part of human culture.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> You remind me of ■■■■■■■■ as a newborn.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Troubled about the fact you were born strong, hating yourself for having to exploit the weak.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> That little girl&#39;s unseemly crying face.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...You still cherish her, don&#39;t you? That person, Gawain.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Never! 200 years ago, when that thing became a Fairy Knight, I stopped thinking about her.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> ...No. What&#39;s up with me...</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Something&#39;s wrong. This is not a matter of valor, but of personal history...</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> This was nothing but idle talk. Forget about tonight. Do not lay it on your mind. I&#39;m returning to the war council.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. Take care, Lord Boggart. But, please, don&#39;t stay up too late.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> —</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> I have wondered this for a while. Why are you not afraid of me?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Most likely, it&#39;s because Sheffield is a beautiful city.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I heard that Lord Boggart rebuilt this city from the ground up.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Even though it is a fortified city, it is a bright and pleasant city that cherishes the fairies who live here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I don&#39;t think I could feel afraid going up against something like that.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> ...That&#39;s true. Compared to Norwich, Sheffield is indeed a beautiful place.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> However, such things conclude today. From tomorrow onwards, the gates will be closed.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Morgan&#39;s army is drawing near. If it comes to battle...you will find it difficult to call it “a beautiful city” any longer.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Lord Boggart, what was that...!?</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> It&#39;s a warning from the scouts. But it&#39;s early, way too early...! Hey, what the hell is going on?</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Give me a status report!</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Are you saying the Queen&#39;s army crossed the eastern Vein Corridor in just two days?!</p><p><strong>Fairy Guardsman:</strong> Sir! The Queen&#39;s army is assembling at the front gate as we speak!</p><p><strong>Fairy Guardsman:</strong> Also, a message was delivered a moment ago. Do you wish to read it?</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Read it. Just the important parts. What does Morgan have to say?</p><p><strong>Fairy Guardsman:</strong> Ha, ha.... . this is......it is...it is......that......</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Report! Why are you hesitating?</p><p><strong>Fairy Guardsman:</strong> Yes, milord!</p><p><strong>Fairy Guardsman:</strong> “Deliver the Child of Prophecy to me. If you comply, I shall grant Sheffield its freedom,”</p><p><strong>Fairy Guardsman:</strong> ...it says!</p><p><strong>Fairies:</strong> Deliver the Child of Prophecy.... . Lady Mash? Why?</p><p><strong>Fairies:</strong> What about Norwich? Is this the solution to our return to Norwich?!</p><p><strong>Fairies:</strong> No, what do they mean by granting freedom in the first place? Do they not see Lord Boggart&#39;s expansion of armaments as a problem!?</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> —Gaaaaaaah!!!!</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Whatever...!</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> You don&#39;t care about our rebellion, Morgan!</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Your insults to the Fang Clan know no bounds—!</p><p><strong>Fairy Guardsman:</strong> Message, message!</p><p><strong>Fairy Guardsman:</strong> Scouts have identified the standard of the Queen&#39;s army!</p><p><strong>Fairy Guardsman:</strong> Gawain is at its front! The Fairy Knight Gawain!</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Oh. So that&#39;s how it is.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> My Queen. You were boastful in your letter, but your true intentions are showing in your command, aren&#39;t they?</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Sending your right-hand, Gawain, proves that you fear our army.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> As long as Knocknarea&#39;s army remains in the north, Sheffield cannot fall.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> The Queen has chosen negotiation over subjugation. The army outside has no intention of fighting.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> It&#39;s no wonder they marched so fast. They are not equipped for battle.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Now...will you return Norwich to us, or will you dispatch troops to purge the “Calamity Pool”?</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Let us hear which one you will choose, O Queen of the Fairy Kingdom.</p><p><strong>Fairy Guardsman:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Fairy Guardsman:</strong> ...and, another thing, Lord Boggart. The standard was not only that of Gawain.</p><p><strong>Fairy Guardsman:</strong> The enemy lines fly the standards of three knights. Tristan, Lancelot—</p><p><strong>Fairy Guardsman:</strong> The sighting of all three fairy knights has been confirmed! What sits at our door is the largest military force in Fairy Kingdom!</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> All of them are here—!?</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Gawain&#39;s Soldier:</strong> All the troops are in position. Is there anything else, Lord Gawain?</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> Stand by until the messenger we sent to Boggart returns. Tell Tristan&#39;s troops to do the same.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> ...And what about Lancelot?</p><p><strong>Morgan&#39;s Soldier:</strong> Lord Lancelot is waiting in the skies. She will descend on the castle when the battle begins.</p><p><strong>Morgan&#39;s Soldier:</strong> Since Her Majesty&#39;s orders were to not only cleanse Sheffield, but to annihilate Boggart&#39;s army,</p><p><strong>Morgan&#39;s Soldier:</strong> anyone in the castle, military and civilians alike, will be caught in Lord Lancelot&#39;s attack.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> ...I see. Either way, it&#39;s a bother for her to fall in line with us.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> Tell Lancelot to descend on the back gate. That is where the Child of Prophecy will escape, should they attempt to do so.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> ...Boggart. If you surrender the city now, we can spare this forthcoming bloodshed. There will be no need to wield my horn in vain.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> This is the difference to our strength. If you are a man of reason, do not resist needlessly—</p><p><strong>Gawain&#39;s Soldier:</strong> Message, message!</p><p><strong>Gawain&#39;s Soldier:</strong> The messenger you sent to Sheffield has returned with a reply from Lord Boggart!</p><p><strong>Gawain&#39;s Soldier:</strong> “There is no Child of Prophecy within my castle. Only the flag of rebellion against the Queen resides here. ”</p><p><strong>Gawain&#39;s Soldier:</strong> “This castle is my lifeblood. Only when my life returns to the earth will it have served its purpose. ”</p><p><strong>Gawain&#39;s Soldier:</strong> That is all!</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> ...The fool.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> First squad, second squad, switch to anti-fortress gear! Sheffield&#39;s walls are tough!</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> It may even surpass my “Foul Weather”! Be prepared to lose 20% of our men before taking the castle!</p><p><strong>Gawain&#39;s Soldier:</strong> Sir! Under Her Majesty the Queen, we are all willing to accept any fate!</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> Boggart...! You&#39;ve got more ambition than you can handle...!</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> Did you really think Her Majesty would let Sheffield off easy, just to keep Knocknarea in check?</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> Do not underestimate us! Even if you strike under the cover of Knocknarea, Camelot will not fall!</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> If you misread the big picture like that, you do not have what it takes to stand as a leader!</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> You&#39;re an old soldier left behind by time, and I will drive you out with this horn of mine!</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Gather our troops! Hold the siege!</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Send an envoy to Knocknarea! We will hold for two days, and she will send reinforcements by then!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Under Boggart&#39;s command, Sheffield&#39;s resistance began.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> “With three Fairy Knights instead of one, there&#39;s no hope for us! We should just hand over the Child of Prophecy! ”</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Many people clamored to such thoughts, but in the end, Boggart curbed them all.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> No one knew for certain if he wanted to keep the Child of Prophecy safe, or to use her as his trump card.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Regardless, it was the right decision. Had he offered up the Child of Prophecy,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> the fairies of Sheffield would have been slaughtered much sooner, and with much less mercy.</p><p><strong>Soldiers of Sheffield:</strong> There&#39;s a report from the watchtower! It is as if the weapons of the Queen&#39;s army are on fire!</p><p><strong>Soldiers of Sheffield:</strong> One layer of the bark has already melted...! Despite being built by the Earth Clan with sturdy oak wood,</p><p><strong>Soldiers of Sheffield:</strong> it won&#39;t last until morning! We need reinforcements as soon as possible...!</p><p><strong>Soldiers of Sheffield:</strong> We have to deal with the Queen&#39;s army climbing over the wall!</p><p><strong>Soldiers of Sheffield:</strong> Although there are not many of them, the enemy soldiers are highly trained. We will eventually be overrun!</p><p><strong>Soldiers of Sheffield:</strong> Our soldiers have put up a good fight. There&#39;s still no fighting inside the castle, but—</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> What!? Is Gawain engaging alone!?</p><p><strong>Soldiers of Sheffield:</strong> It&#39;s an aerial assault by Fairy Knight Lancelot! She is destroying all of the barracks!</p><p><strong>Soldiers of Sheffield:</strong> It&#39;s no use, even the eyes of the Wind Clan cannot track her...! She&#39;s too fast, we can&#39;t shoot her down...!</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> I don&#39;t care if the barracks have been taken out! Drop her to the ground! Then I&#39;ll deal with her myself!</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Lancelot may have the agility of a honey bee, but that is all she has going for her. Once she&#39;s on the ground, she will be no match for me.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> What happened this time!? Did they fire a cannon at us!?</p><p><strong>Soldiers of Sheffield:</strong> No, it&#39;s Gawain!</p><p><strong>Soldiers of Sheffield:</strong> She is standing in front of the main gate by herself, and she is swinging Galatine!</p><p><strong>Soldiers of Sheffield:</strong> The bark at the main gate only has 10 layers left! At this rate, the regrowth will not be able to keep up!</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> That little girl...! What is happening in the castle, what happened to the soldiers&#39; formation!?</p><p><strong>Soldiers of Sheffield:</strong> That&#39;s...The residents started panicking, and we cannot deploy the formation fully!</p><p><strong>Soldiers of Sheffield:</strong> Some fairies started demanding that the back gate be opened, and so a riot broke out—</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> The back gate shall not be opened! If even one person escapes outside, our collapse will start from there!</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Guard Captain, you have defended the throne well, now take control of suppressing the riots!</p><p><strong>Guard of the Throne:</strong> Understood! Let&#39;s go, everyone!</p><p><strong>Soldiers of Sheffield:</strong> There is chaos both inside the walls and outside! If only the fighting was all in one place...!</p><p><strong>Soldiers of Sheffield:</strong> Please give us orders, Lord Boggart! What should we do!?</p><p><strong>Soldiers of Sheffield:</strong> You were the one who claimed that we could hold back the Queen&#39;s army when they attacked! Or should we offer up the Child of Prophecy now—!?</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> I know, I know! All we have to do is stop one of them!</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> We have a cannon powered by magecraft here! Let&#39;s test the power of the Child of Prophecy!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Boggart, exasperated, ran to the “Iron Cylinder” attached to the castle&#39;s keep.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Boggart himself did not think that this would change the tide of the battle.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Nonetheless, he placed his finger on the trigger in the hopes that it would at least bring about a stalemate.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> This was the beginning of the end for Sheffield.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The coup de grâce which turned the siege into a raze.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The ray of light emitted from the castle&#39;s keep quite literally swept away the atmosphere of the battlefield.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> More than 600 of the Queen&#39;s soldiers, who had been attacking the main gate of the castle, vanished in an instant.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Even the soldiers of Sheffield who had fought valiantly on the ramparts met their end, blood spurting from every orifice of their bodies.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> All the fairies in the vicinity of the trajectory of the blast had dropped dead, as if falling asleep.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The castle walls, the same walls which withstood direct attacks from Galatine, had melted down into not even a shadow of their former selves.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The Fairy Knight who had stood in front of the main gate was now nothing more than a hazy figure in the white smoke.</p><p><strong>Gawain&#39;s Soldier:</strong> Lord Gawain—Lord Gawain—</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> For but a moment, fear ruled the battlefield. The morale of the Queen&#39;s army plummeted,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> and even the soldiers of Sheffield, who should have been crying out in jubilation, had the same peace of mind as if they were in the midst of a nightmare.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Amidst the white smoke, a single shadow arose with the roar of a beast.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Ha—</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Haha—</p><p><strong>Soldiers of Sheffield:</strong> Lord...Boggart...Lo...gart...</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Haha, hahaha, hahahahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> What is this, what in the world is this!? Amazing, truly amazing!</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Behold, soldiers! If this isn&#39;t a good blessing, then what is!?</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> We can win, we can win! With this Cylinder, even Fairy Knights are nothing to be feared!</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> No need to stop at Morgan! That fool Woodwose too!</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> And Knocknarea in the North! And that “Calamity Pool” that has fallen on Norwich!</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> We can exterminate them all, blow them all away! This is splendid, simply SPLENDID!!!!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> But Boggart did not notice. Although he saw it, he did not notice it.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Not the anomaly of the Queen&#39;s soldiers, who lacked so much as a corpse. Not the soldiers who suffered and lost their lives on the castle walls.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Not the fairies falling in the streets. Not even the soldiers falling like withered trees right beside him.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ah— Aah, ah—</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The Child of Prophecy fell to her knees, in despair of her sins.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> It wasn&#39;t just that she had hurt the people of the city she so loved.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> It&#39;s true that she had brought the Cylinder here.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> And she hadn&#39;t been able to stop Boggart, that was true as well.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> But her real sin, she thought, was her own weakness. In using her amnesia as an excuse,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> she never once stopped to think about the impact her actions would have on those around her; about the lack of foresight regarding the consequences of her presence here.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Next, who&#39;s next!? Lancelot, where are you flying to!?</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Child of Prophecy, come over here! If you do it, you can surely fire this thing more accurately than I!</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> That blue bee is next! Drop her from the sky! Burn the entirety of the Queen&#39;s army to the ground, fwahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Unaware of the anomalies surrounding him, Boggart turned to look behind him.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> And there he saw,</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Why do I—</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> have to hurt a world as beautiful as this...?</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> —</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Leave him here, we have to go, Mash! We cannot stay here with him, we have to escape!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> —B-but, to leave Lord Boggart alone,</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> —Tsk, I don&#39;t need you! You were always too soft at heart!</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> A queen who cries in battle will only get in my way! Take her wherever!</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> See what I mean! Boggart has already set his mind on killing all his enemies!</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Even if you stay here, nothing will change! What do you want to do here!? What CAN you do here!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Outside...! We have to help everyone in this city!</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Ok, let&#39;s get going! I had planned to run, but I&#39;ll go with you!</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Goodbye, Boggart! For all the work I have done for you, I will take this bride as payment!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, and—please stay safe, Boggart!</p><p><strong>Gawain&#39;s Soldier:</strong> Aah...Lord Gawain! I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re alive!</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> Hah? You can&#39;t believe...? Oh, the bullet of light just now.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> It was nothing more than hot light filled with magical energy! It tinged with poisonous iron, but there was nothing more to it!</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> It had no skill, no conviction! It was nothing compared to a strike from Her Majesty Morgan!</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> Resume the advance, you weaklings! You are still the elites of Camelot!</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> Boggart has, in his foolishness, destroyed his own strongest line of defense!</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> Go through that fool&#39;s front gate and capture the castle!</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Gawain:</strong> We need not pursue those who fled. The priority is for the castle of Sheffield to fall!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> As the Queen&#39;s army passed through the front gate, the soldiers of Sheffield fought back.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Those holed up in their homes, clasping each other&#39;s hands, had no choice but to surrender to the Queen&#39;s army breaking through their doors.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Seeing the fall of the front gate, those who were able rushed to the back gate in order to escape.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Fairy Knight Gawain did not move from the front gate, and instead gazed up at the tower of the castle one kilometer away.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> As if to tell Boggart, whose mind had been transfixed by the destructive force of the Cylinder: “Aim here. ”</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> You think you stand a chance against me...! You think you can bait me, little girl?</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Damn you, knight of Morgan! Next time, you shall not endure!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Boggart, in all his excitement, had not even noticed that the poison from the “Cylinder” was felling him as well.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> All that remained to him in this moment was hostility towards the blasted Fairy Knight Gawain, and his admiration for ■■■■■■■■&#39;s excellent leadership.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Hu...that little girl, how dare she—</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Boggart&#39;s mouth hung agape at the thought of her having become such an impressive knight.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> At the same time, what came to his mind was the tears he had seen before.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> —</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> For the first time on this battlefield, he stopped to wonder “why? ”</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Why had that girl cried? Why had she been so distraught?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> There was nothing to be distraught about. For in the end, Boggart would never come to understand the sensitivity of that girl.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> No, this is a battlefield! What are you confused about!? Weapons are to be used, and enemies are to be defeated!</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Sheffield is mine...! It will not relinquish even one of my people as long as I live!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> There was a thinly veiled sense that his anger was not directed at the Fairy Knight, but at his own inadequacy.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Fingertips beginning to numb, Boggart placed his finger on the trigger one final time.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It seems the inside of the castle is still safe. Is it possible to evacuate everyone from the streets into here!?</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> It&#39;s possible, but there would be nowhere to run if we had to! We&#39;d either be caught or killed!</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> If we want to save as many people as possible, we should open the rear gate and secure an escape route!</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Sheffield will fall faster, but it will whether we do this or not, so who cares!</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Whether it&#39;s to be captured and killed by the Queen&#39;s army, or to flee to the north and become one of Knocknarea&#39;s slaves,</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> to disappear into the fields, or to escape into the realm of a Fairy Deadlord!</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> You should at least have the freedom to choose for yourself! Let&#39;s go to the back gate, Mash!</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> But if we run into a Fairy Knight, we&#39;ll run away, okay? Those guys are only after you, Mash!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes...! I&#39;m coming, Habetrot!</p><p><strong>Sheffield Fairy:</strong> Quickly, quickly, open the gates! The Queen&#39;s army is coming!</p><p><strong>Sheffield Fairy:</strong> If we get caught, won&#39;t we get taxed!?</p><p><strong>Sheffield Fairy:</strong> I don&#39;t have that much life force left, so if they do that, I&#39;ll die!</p><p><strong>Sheffield Guard:</strong> Calm down, even if we open the gate, the situation won&#39;t change! You can&#39;t get out of this place!</p><p><strong>Sheffield Guard:</strong> Go back to your homes, go back! Lord Boggart will drive away the Queen&#39;s army in no time!</p><p><strong>Sheffield Guard:</strong> Hold on until then! If you are without a home, head to the castle!</p><p><strong>Sheffield Guard:</strong> We have to get to the front gate, we can&#39;t afford to lose time here...!</p><p><strong>Sheffield Fairy:</strong> It&#39;s no use! Flames are raining from the sky...! If we stay in the house, we&#39;ll only burn to death!</p><p><strong>Sheffield Fairy:</strong> Isn&#39;t the inside of the castle already packed with the Queen&#39;s soldiers?</p><p><strong>Sheffield Fairy:</strong> We have to run outside, Knocknarea&#39;s army will be arriving soon, right!?</p><p><strong>Sheffield Fairy:</strong> They&#39;ll definitely help us! After all, we&#39;re with the king!</p><p><strong>Sheffield Fairy:</strong> Just get out of here, there&#39;s nothing to be gained by staying here!</p><p><strong>Sheffield Fairy:</strong> There&#39;s no way we can rely on Boggart! He&#39;s been a loser from the Fang Clan from the very beginning!</p><p><strong>Sheffield Fairies:</strong> That&#39;s right, that&#39;s right! Lord Boggart has failed! Even though he was the ruler of this territory, he was weak!</p><p><strong>Sheffield Fairies:</strong> It&#39;s 2,000 years too early for him to be pointing his blades at the Queen!</p><p><strong>Sheffield Guard:</strong> You—!</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Aah, what the hell! It feels like this place is about to explode at any minute!</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> It seems like there&#39;s going to be in-fighting here before the Queen&#39;s army can even capture us.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> We can&#39;t even get any help from the guards, it seems. I get it, but...</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Come on, this way&#39;s blocked too! Master Boggart was way too thorough with this.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Wag, how are those sewers? You think we can get through there?</p><p><strong>Wag:</strong> No use, the walls extend down here too! Even if it&#39;s to prevent invasion, this is just too much!</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> This is really bad, there&#39;s really no way to escape. Wag, have you checked how to get the rear gate open?</p><p><strong>Wag:</strong> Of course I did! I overheard the guards like you said I would, brother!</p><p><strong>Wag:</strong> The two of us could probably handle it. On both sides of the gate, in the left and right guardrooms,</p><p><strong>Wag:</strong> there are levers behind the third pillar with a vine pattern on it. If we flip those, we&#39;re good.</p><p><strong>Wag:</strong> Oh, but don&#39;t step on the picket of the scaffolding below the lever. They say that it&#39;s a safety device that renders the lever useless.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> If you know this much, then you&#39;re good to go. Good job, Wag. You&#39;ll be able to finish the job by yourself now.</p><p><strong>Wag:</strong> Hehehe, is that so? Is that so!?</p><p><strong>Wag:</strong> I wonder if I&#39;ll be able to do everything by myself like Winky!</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Oh, we&#39;ll see, we&#39;ll see. Think about it more when I get caught.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Well then, let&#39;s grab the guards&#39; attention and get that gate opened.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> The fairies in Sheffield have treated me to a lot of drinks.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> This is the least I can do for them—Damn, it&#39;s the Queen&#39;s army! They&#39;re already here!</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Forget about opening the gate, Wag. Let&#39;s hide in here and see what happens!</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> We were a little too late, whatever we do now won&#39;t go well! Hell is gonna break out all around us!</p><p><strong>Wag:</strong> Huuh!? B-b-but, all we have to do is open the gate, right!?</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Idiot, I&#39;ve taught you to not do more than you&#39;re supposed to.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> What&#39;s the most valuable thing in this world? Your own life, right?</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Then you have to take great care of it. If it&#39;s worth the most, you have get the most out of it, right?</p><p><strong>Wag:</strong> I see. That&#39;s right. It&#39;s not good to barely get any use of something that&#39;s very precious.</p><p><strong>Wag:</strong> Then let&#39;s wait a little longer in here, in these sewers— Brother, over there!</p><p><strong>Wag:</strong> The Queen&#39;s soldiers are being blown away! That&#39;s— that&#39;s Annis, brother!</p><p><strong>Wag:</strong> Annis came to help!</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> I told you, she&#39;s Mash now! But well, this changes things!</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Let&#39;s sneak into the guardroom now, while Mash has the attention of both the Queen&#39;s soldiers and the guards!</p><p><strong>Wag:</strong> Phew, she did it! That&#39;s our Mash, our Child of Prophecy!</p><p>Note! Scene Change</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Fairies streamed to the back gate, as the Queen&#39;s army rushed to capture them.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The guards stepped forward to intercept the army, but the escaping citizens blocked their way, rendering them unable to do so.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The Queen&#39;s soldiers swung their blades on the fairies struggling to escape their inevitable death through the gate.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Once the blood began flowing, it would not cease.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The fairies were gripped with fear as the soldiers dealt with them, in a way befitting insurgents.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The back gate had become an ocean of blood. Not a single person could escape.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Of course, there was no way she would let such a thing come to pass.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Haaaaaaah!!!!!</p><p><strong>I：Sheffield Guard:</strong> Lady Mash!? Why are you here!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m here to assist! Lute, can you open the back gate!?</p><p><strong>I：Sheffield Guard:</strong> O-on my own accord...! But, yes, I will!</p><p><strong>I：Sheffield Guard:</strong> If the Lord&#39;s consort, Lady Mash, is passing through, there&#39;s no other option but to open it!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes...! Thank you so much!</p><p><strong>I：Sheffield Guard:</strong> Think nothing of it.</p><p><strong>I：Sheffield Guard:</strong> ...I&#39;m about to do something I will regret. I&#39;ve failed my job as a guard.</p><p><strong>I：Sheffield Guard:</strong> I&#39;m opening the gate, someone come help me! Hurry! Don&#39;t let the Queen&#39;s army proceed past the guardroom!</p><p><strong>I：Sheffield Guard:</strong> Don&#39;t let anyone touch the safety device! If you see anyone suspicious, go ahead and cut them down!</p><p><strong>Queen&#39;s Soldier:</strong> We have sighted the fairy who is suspected of being the Child of Prophecy. She must be dealt with here.</p><p><strong>Queen&#39;s Soldier:</strong> Four of you, come with me. The rest stay here and finish off the citizens.</p><p><strong>Queen&#39;s Soldier:</strong> Do not let anyone who dares defy the Queen escape.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ha—! I am your opponent!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Shed any further blood, and I will respond in kind.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I am the Knight of Sheffield, Fairy Knight Galahad!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I am your enemy, and I will be the one to defeat you...!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Sheffield Fairy:</strong> The gate has been opened! The Child of Prophecy has opened the gate!</p><p><strong>Sheffield Fairy:</strong> I don&#39;t see the Queen&#39;s army outside! Hurry up, hurry! We can take this chance to escape!</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Alright, we&#39;re done here! We should escape too, Mash!</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Leave Boggart to fend for the city.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> He may be a brute, but he&#39;s still an actual knight. If he planned to rebel, I&#39;m sure he was prepared to be defeated.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> You don&#39;t have to stand with him. This is his final battle, and his alone.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Habetrot!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...escaping is prohibited.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...death by the noose, or death here. The choice is yours to make.</p><p><strong>Sheffield Fairy:</strong> La, la—</p><p><strong>Sheffield Fairy:</strong> Lancelot! It&#39;s Fairy Knight Lancelot!</p><p><strong>Sheffield Fairy:</strong> Ee, eeeek! I&#39;m going to be killed, I&#39;m going to be killed!</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Wha— What&#39;s that? Fairy...? Fairy Knight? THAT thing?</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Lancelot:</strong> ...Sighting of the Child of Prophecy, confirmed. I was hoping it would not fall to me, but I have no choice. She must be captured.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Lancelot:</strong> ...more importantly. What did you say just now?</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Lancelot:</strong> Galahad, was it...That&#39;s a grand statement for a nobody.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> This is bad, she&#39;s coming for us. You have to give it everything you&#39;ve got, Mash!</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> And yeah, why did you call yourself Galahad anyways!?</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Just who is that even, what kind of sugar daddy are you keeping on the side, you...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> N-no, I don&#39;t know either, I was just spurred on by the heat of the moment...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Never mind that, I will fight back! Everyone, please escape...!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ugh-ghhhhh...!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I can&#39;t...stand up to...even one of them...my powers are...already...</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Lancelot:</strong> ...I see. I figured you would would endure a little, but—that shield...</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Lancelot:</strong> Relying on the protection of the Round Table is without sense. Such Mystery is completely different.</p><p><strong>Sheffield Guard:</strong> Shit! That explosion just now was from the castle tower—did something happen to Lord Boggart!?</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> (Aha! It&#39;s nice to see you&#39;re not giving up, but that face! Oh come off it, don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re planning to save him—!? )</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Lancelot:</strong> ...you have regained your strength, then. A stubborn one, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Lancelot:</strong> Is it simply for the fact that you call yourself Galahad?</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Lancelot:</strong> But you can&#39;t, Child of Prophecy. This is the end for you.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Lancelot:</strong> You cannot leave here. There is no need for two Children of Prophecy.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Lancelot:</strong> Farewell. You were far too hasty to name yourself a Fairy Knight, and to falsely assume the name of Galahad.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Lancelot:</strong> —Who&#39;s there?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Sorry, but that young lady is my acquaintance.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I didn&#39;t want to involve myself, but it&#39;d be no good for her to die here.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Stand down, Lancelot. That way, we can both return to our lives before long.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Are you—are you perhaps the wolf who&#39;s been watching over me constantly...?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Come on, does something so obvious really need to be said?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I guess you have good intuition, or rather, good discernment as always, young lady.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Leave this one to me and run. I can at least buy you some time.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Y-yes, I&#39;ll take your word for it! Thank you very much, robed man!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Huh, you&#39;re not going outside!? What are you doing, heading back into the castle!? Heeeeeyyyy!?</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> I knew it...</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> But it can&#39;t be helped, that&#39;s just how Mash is!</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Grimm! You&#39;re Grimm, right! Sorry it&#39;s been so long, but I&#39;m looking forward to working together again!</p><p><strong>Grimm the Wise:</strong> Yeah, leave it to me. Though, if my enemy is her, there&#39;s no way I&#39;d end up surviving!</p><p><strong>Grimm the Wise:</strong> Nevertheless, I ask of you, will you be my enemy? I&#39;ll at least fight you with the determination to drive you out of this castle.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Lancelot:</strong> ...Grimm. So, you are Grimm the Wise...</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Lancelot:</strong> A familiar of the savior who once lived during the Fairy Calendar. Now a Servant summoned in the Queen&#39;s Calendar, seemingly not having learned his lesson.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Lancelot:</strong> Her Majesty the Queen has given me leave to handle you...Out of curiosity, do you have any last words?</p><p><strong>Grimm the Wise:</strong> It&#39;d take too long to tell. Well, we&#39;re both outsiders in this Fairy Kingdom,</p><p><strong>Grimm the Wise:</strong> so let&#39;s not worry about our surroundings, and fight to our heart&#39;s desire!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>???:</strong> Huuuh, he deflected that one too. It seems true then, that he&#39;s as hardy as Gawain.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> But hooooow sad ♡ I&#39;m not interested in the hardness of his hide.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> I want to touch his throbbing muscles, and scrape out his rumbling knotty intestines.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Look, your insides are a disarranged and suffering mess! I&#39;m gonna make you look like an unsellable doll!</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png" alt="1-light"></p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> Uh-oh, careful with that, Lady. You&#39;re making blood splatter all over us.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> I&#39;m about to reunite with a very dear friend of mine. I can&#39;t have my only good suit getting stained.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> What are you talking about? You were already covered in blood.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> But hey, better yet, look, Beryl, how miserable Boggart is.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> A spell that reflects the soul to create a projection...Look, look, it works just as I imagined!</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Bend your arms ~ ♪ Bend your legs ~ ♪</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> He&#39;s just like some ugly marionette! This magecraft you taught me is too much fun!</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Agh—, agh, ah—!</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> Yeah, they call it Fetch!</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> I couldn&#39;t use it, because it was a little too advanced for me, but it is no problem for a fairy such as you.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> It&#39;s quite the perfect match, actually! Well, I didn&#39;t imagine you would become so addicted to it!</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> It&#39;s called Fetch, oh~~! I&#39;ve decided, I will use this as my Noble Phantasm!</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> I&#39;m going to use you as my plaything from now on, but you won&#39;t know what is happening.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> You&#39;ll be in my hands, but won&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing to you.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Aaah— this is the best!</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Shake your head from side to side, put your hands together in prayer! There is no better way for a fool to die!</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> .... Screw you...Tris.... tan...you sow, as if— I—.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Shut it. Just die already. How are you still alive even after I dismantled your heart, damn it?</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> Hold on, it&#39;s still too early for that. Stay calm. Please, Lady.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> Boggart still has to be useful one last time. He just has to stay alive a little longer...until...</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> Speak of the devil, here she comes. Good. She really did love you, didn&#39;t she, my lord?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Are you all right, Boggart?</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> —wh...y? —</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Wait, Mash, slow down for a secon— Woah, what&#39;s that!?</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Boggart is all bloody and floating in the air! The ones on the throne, is this their doing!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...guh. We&#39;re here to help now, please hold on...!</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> Hooooooold it right there. If you move even an inch, Lord Boggart dies, okay?</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> You came to help, right? Then let&#39;s be friendly, and talk it out first.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> Isn&#39;t that right, Mash? You&#39;re not a belligerent woman, are you?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You&#39;re—</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...someone I know. But my memory...</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> Ah, I get it, I get it. Lost your memory, have you?</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> What was it...Mikey? Minky? No, Funky?</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> I got all the details from a guy with a name like that.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> But what a disaster, Mash! I can&#39;t even begin to imagine your troubles.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> Struggling so much in such a strange land! I, Beryl Gut, have come for you!</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> I know everything about your past! Now, let&#39;s go to New Darlington together!</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> We&#39;ll have lots of fun conversations there, just like old times, won&#39;t we?</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> ...Mash. This guy&#39;s no good. Lancelot was a troublesome opponent because she was so strong, but...</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Whether he&#39;s strong or weak, this guy&#39;s bad. The stench of blood permeates his soul.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I agree with you. Even if he seems like someone I know...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We can&#39;t take his words for granted. That much we can be sure of.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> Oh, come now, Mash. What, you lost your memory and became peevish?</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> Ah I see, it was was the poor nature of the fairies you kept company with, wasn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> You&#39;re right. If I&#39;d been around filthy bandits, I would be very suspicious too.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> But rest assured, I&#39;ve always been your...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What happened to the fairy who told you about me?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> —Tell me, where is Winky now?</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> —I can&#39;t tell you that.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> After all, I don&#39;t know where dead people go when they die, nor do I really care to find out.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You—!</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Hey! Don&#39;t you dare move another step!</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> No way!</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> Oh...!</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> H-how cruel, huh— I&#39;ve never seen such a fierce romantic gesture—</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> Scary, scary. At this rate, we&#39;ll be chopped to pieces.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> To be honest, neither I nor the Fairy Knight over there are any match for you right now.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> After all, you are the Fairy Knight who took the name of Galahad, the greatest of the Knights of the Round Table, the Knight of Heaven.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> Why, in that case we have no choice but use dirty tricks. If you will, Tristan.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Leave it to me. Are you sure this is what you want?</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Look, I&#39;m going to lead your beloved Lord Boggart over this wall. If I release the string, he will fall head first to the ground.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Falling from this height would be nothing for him normally, but this guy&#39;s been beaten to death&#39;s door.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> It will be the finishing blow for him.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> So, how long will you be courting my man for?</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> Bless you, Lady Spinel!</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> How did you even know what I wanted you to do? You&#39;re a genius!</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Of course I understand you, it&#39;s you and I! I know exactly where this is going!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...What on earth is your goal here?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You haven&#39;t come to capture the Child of Prophecy...to capture me, have you?</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> No, to be honest, I came here to kill the Child of Prophecy.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> But well, the situation is a bit tricky. It looks like we&#39;re in a tough spot.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> We&#39;re no match for you.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> You won&#39;t forgive us for hurting Boggart.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> Frankly, if Boggart dies here, we&#39;ll die next.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> We couldn&#39;t stop you if you flew into a rage.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...That&#39;s right. I&#39;m not sure you could either.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> Right, then! Let&#39;s do a bit of gambling!</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> I&#39;ll share a secret with you. I am Morgan&#39;s Master.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> Ah, you don&#39;t understand the meaning of Master. Well, think of it like I&#39;m Morgan&#39;s husband.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> If you kill me, Morgan&#39;s army and power alike will be halved.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> As the Child of Prophecy, you can&#39;t possibly pass up on this opportunity.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> As I said before, even the two of us are no match for you.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> It&#39;s a shame I set all this up to bring you here, because if it comes down to a fight between us, all will be lost.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> Unless there was some sort of...hindrance, I guess?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You&#39;re asking me to let you escape in exchange for saving Boggart?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You want me to choose one or the other.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> No, there&#39;ll be no need for you to choose, will there?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The thread that held Boggart in the air snapped.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Beryl Gut knew her all too well.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> He knew full well that she would not hesitate to jump after Boggart to save him.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Boggart...!</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> You see? No matter what&#39;s going on inside her head, her reaction will be the same regardless.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> Whether she lost her memory or not, it doesn&#39;t matter!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Beryl Gut&#39;s laughter echoed through the air. After laughing for a while at her do-or-die rescue...</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> Now then, let&#39;s retrieve the Black Barrel— where would it be—</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> Hey, Lady. The cannon that was up there until a little while ago. Big thing, three meters long.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> Where&#39;d it go? Did it maybe just...fall down? Seriously?</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Eh...sorry, I didn&#39;t see it. I was busy daydreaming about you, so...</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> Ahhh...</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> Well, nothing can be done about it! It&#39;s all right. Not a big deal!</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> So we&#39;ve had enough fun. Let&#39;s go home, Lady Spinel.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Huh? Is it alright to leave the Mash girl alone? You wanted her so badly.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> Yeah. Morgan told us not get into a fight with the Child of Prophecy, right?</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> In the first place, everyone but Lancelot had the tables turned on them. I&#39;ll have to think for a little longer on how to get my hands on her.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> ...That&#39;s right. She&#39;s stronger than me...</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> What&#39;s with that, that&#39;s so boring. She was so cocky, I wanted to mess her up.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> I&#39;m so stressed, I feel like I&#39;m going to die. May I go and butcher the fairies here?</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> Come now, it&#39;s better to just change the way you do things.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> I told you, didn&#39;t I? If you can&#39;t hurt them on the outside, then let them rot from the inside.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> As the Child of Prophecy, she will help others to her heart&#39;s content.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> What awaits her at the end is a guilty conscience.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> The more she acts the part of the Child of Prophecy, the more she&#39;ll despair at the end of it all.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> After all, that&#39;s the foundation on which this Fairy Kingdom was built, right?</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> She fell for a few seconds from the throne room, down into the castle courtyard.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> She sprung down the castle wall, taking Boggart&#39;s dying body in her arms, and fell to the ground on her back.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Guh...ah—</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> She had moved to protect the dying Boggart, but his weight had been added to hers,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> and as expected, she had become dizzy from the impact.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No, this is...nothing—! But Boggart, are you safe?</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> —guh—</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> I&#39;m alright. Come...now, it&#39;s only the second time I&#39;ve fallen from this height.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Despite his gasping for air, Boggart&#39;s harsh tone remained.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The girl was relieved, but that relief was short-lived.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Boggart&#39;s body was cold as the stone around him, his breath short and sharp.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We&#39;ll get you medical care soon...but, all the people in the castle...</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> No matter. There are no more medics.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> I could hear the clashing of swords. The sound of fires. The soldiers screaming as they fought.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> ...So that&#39;s it. They even took the castle?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes...by the time I returned to the castle, it was already lost.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> You...why...</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> ...No...it&#39;s all right.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Take me to the rear gate. You returned to assist me, so will you do that?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. Ah, no, Habetrot hasn&#39;t...</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> I&#39;m right here~! What were you thinking, jumping off the castle walls like that!</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Thankfully, it turned out to be the fastest escape route.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Thank goodness...! As one would expect of you, Habenyan, you&#39;re light and nimble!</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> That&#39;s right! My spinning machine can even fly for a while! It&#39;s got all the bells and whistles you&#39;d expect!</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> But you&#39;re not allowed to call me Habenyan! That would make me the happiest of all!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Right.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Now then, I will escort Boggart to the rear gate! Habetrot, can you cover us?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> “Of course,” Habetrot replied with a nod.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> All the while, the girl tried her best to hold Boggart&#39;s large frame in her arms.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> She came to the realization that the magical energy which had overwhelmed her earlier had now dissipated.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> With her fight against Lancelot, and the fall just now, she had long since reached her limit.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> You fool. You might be a Fairy Knight, but you are still part human.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You mustn&#39;t, Boggart! You cannot carry me with that body of yours...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I can walk on my own, so just set me down!</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> If you don&#39;t even have the strength to remove my grip on your body, you will not convince me of such a thing.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> The rear gate is this way. Let&#39;s go.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Boggart lifted her aloft in his arms and, with his body covered in blood, began his stride.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Laboriously, painstakingly, but as steadily and earnest as a groom running away with his bride in his arms.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Woah, it&#39;s even worse than before!</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> This is bad, Boggart. The rear gate is crowded with fairies! If we approach now, the Queen&#39;s soldiers are sure to spot us!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Until this moment, Habetrot had managed to lead them past the Queen&#39;s army undetected.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> But such good fortune was drawing to a close.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Once they entered the street leading to the gate, the Child of Prophecy and Boggart alike would be seen by everyone.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Indeed...It is quite fortuitous that the gates are open, but this...hmm?</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> ...No, we will exit from that gate. If we stay here, we&#39;re sure to be found out.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> With your help, some of my strength has returned. We will run from here.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> I will also have to lead the people who are still confused about whether they should stay in the city or escape.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Child of Prophecy. You stand out. Keep your head down until we&#39;re outside.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...? Y-yes, I understand.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> ...Alright, let&#39;s get going.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Why are you dawdling, you fools!?</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> The castle has fallen, the fighting in the main street has come to an end! The Queen&#39;s soldiers are coming this way!</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Escape through the back gate into the twisting cave of Thistle Hill! If you are a citizen of Sheffield, you know what this means, don&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Sheffield Fairies:</strong> Lord Boggart! You&#39;re alive!?</p><p><strong>Sheffield Fairies:</strong> B-but, the twisting cave of Thistle Hill is a place of no return. That&#39;s where the Fairy Deadlord...</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> I will be going. Should you have other plans in mind, do as you please. But you cannot stay here.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Hear them now, their footsteps! The largest body of the Queen&#39;s army, Gawain&#39;s Black Dog squad, approaches!</p><p><strong>Sheffield Fairies:</strong> Damn it!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> At Boggart&#39;s command, the fairies all rushed out of the rear gate, one after the other.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Boggart held the girl, as if to relieve the fairies&#39; confusion.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> And then he himself slowly marched through the gate.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> You did great, Boggart. But what will we do if they make it outside?</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Look behind you, the Queen&#39;s army is chasing after us!</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> As long as the gates remain open, they will soon catch up to the people—huh?</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> The gates are closing...What a contraption, Boggart.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> It&#39;s designed to close after you walk through it?</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> ...It seems so...once again, we have been blessed with good fortune.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> There was a tone of anguish to Boggart&#39;s voice. Through it, you could sense that something was not right.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> She raised her head with all her might, and faced the now distant gate.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> —</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Wait. Please wait! Wait...! Aah...aah...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> G—...G—.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Good—Goodbye, goodbye!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Thank you for...for saving me that day...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Thank you for granting me a name...! Thank you for always making me smile...!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> With Boggart still holding her in his arms where they stood,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> she frantically waved toward the two brothers, thanking them with the most genuine smile she could muster.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Master Boggart, he&#39;s alive! Is that Mash?</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> So they got there in time to help him...in this situation, we should do something to help, as well...</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> ...but...this...</p><p><strong>Wag:</strong> How awful, Mash&#39;s face is so pale! I can see it all the way from here!</p><p><strong>Wag:</strong> I bet Lancelot got to her, and that&#39;s why Boggart is supporting her!</p><p><strong>Wag:</strong> But what a relief that they&#39;re able to run away!</p><p><strong>Wag:</strong> We should go too, bro! We could travel with Mash once again!</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> ......Right. That wouldn&#39;t be so bad.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> I bet we could even get Master Boggart to join us. He&#39;d be a great bodyguard.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> And if he was there, things would be a lot easier for Mash. Hehe, Winky might object to that, though.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> But you know, before we do that, there&#39;s something else we have to take care of.</p><p><strong>Wag:</strong> Huh? What could that possibly be? What could be so important right now?</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Yeah, someone&#39;s gotta do it. I can&#39;t do this alone.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Wag, I can&#39;t do this without you.</p><p><strong>Wag:</strong> Brother? What&#39;s with that scary face?</p><p><strong>Wag:</strong> Come on, tell me. We&#39;re brothers, aren&#39;t we? If there&#39;s something you want to do, I&#39;ll help you.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Oh, right, right. Well then, let&#39;s go close that gate.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> We overheard how to do it earlier, so it should be easy.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> We lower the lever to close the gate, and trigger the safety mechanism so that it can&#39;t open again.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> That should be enough. The Queen&#39;s army won&#39;t be able to get outside for a while.</p><p><strong>Wag:</strong> Haaah!? Bro, what are you saying?</p><p><strong>Wag:</strong> —</p><p><strong>Wag:</strong> —Alright. I see, I see. Alright, brother! Let&#39;s do it!</p><p><strong>Wag:</strong> But we can at least say goodbye first, right? I wouldn&#39;t want to worry Mash!</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Sure. We&#39;ll have to break into the guardroom either way, so let&#39;s go to the top of the stairs and escape to the top of the gate.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> And then...alright, alright, Master Boggart has his eyes on us.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> He&#39;s a real stickler for detail, he is. I&#39;m sure he&#39;s guessed the plan.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Why are you dawdling, you fools!?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Boggart&#39;s sturdy voice resounded throughout the square.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> It gathered the attention of the confused fairies, but at the same time, it called the attention of the Queen&#39;s army.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Well then, let&#39;s go, Wag. This is the first time I&#39;ve been this excited since we came to the Fairy Kingdom.</p><p><strong>Wag:</strong> Yeah, you&#39;re right, bro! We&#39;ve made people angry, been scolded, hated...</p><p><strong>Wag:</strong> We&#39;ve been through a lot, but in the end, I&#39;m glad we ended up here!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> And so the gate shut.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The Queen&#39;s soldiers were, of course, furious.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> When they found the two fairies hiding in the guardroom, they would slash them without end to try and drive them out.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Outside they could see Boggart moving away, and in his arms, the face of the girl who turned to face them.</p><p><strong>Wag:</strong> Look, brother, Mash spotted us! She&#39;s looking right here!</p><p><strong>Wag:</strong> Heey, heey! I&#39;m glad you&#39;re okay! Take caaaaaare!</p><p><strong>Wag:</strong> I&#39;m too much of an idiot to make myself clear but...Thank you for everything, I mean it!</p><p><strong>Wag:</strong> Thank you for saving our lives!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Rob looked on sorrowfully, yet pridefully, as his younger brother waved and gestured.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The sound of military boots echoed downstairs. Soon, their journey would meet its end.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> ...Hey, it isn&#39;t all bad. When you put your life on the line for something, you know you&#39;re doing it for what matters the most.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Aah, screw it, I&#39;m waving too! I don&#39;t give a shit about the Queen&#39;s men!</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> So long, and good luck, Mash!</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Don&#39;t worry about us, we&#39;ve already gotten our payment!</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Despite the prophecy, you saved us, you whimsical knight!</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> It was a great journey! My most cherished memory, I&#39;ll never forget it for as long as I live!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Following this, some soldiers gave chase, but Boggart and his people were able to escape undetected.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> This is how the battle of Sheffield came to its end.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Above that rear gate, the voices of those two fairies, seeing their friend off until the very end, lived on forever and ever.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The fairies who escaped from Sheffield were in a certain cave in the north.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The twisted cave in Thistle Hill. An evil cave inhabited by a lone Fairy Deadlord.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Boggart had prepared this place for use as an emergency shelter.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The Fairy Deadlord had been done in by Boggart, and it was now a sanctuary.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Naturally, there were stockpiles of food prepared for humans. There were even the oak trees that the fairies liked.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> As Lord, Boggart had done what was required of him. Even so, Boggart was now—</p><p><strong>Sheffield Guard:</strong> Lord Boggart, please, at least have a drink of this. It&#39;s morning dew of the thistle flower.</p><p><strong>Sheffield Guard:</strong> It might at least moisten your throat...</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Boggart did not move any longer. The heat had all but left his body, and the light all but left his eyes.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> It had been a lie that his strength had returned. It was the last remaining stubbornness of him as a lord.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> ......Hey, where is the Child of Prophecy...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Yes, I&#39;m right here with you, Lord Boggart.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> ...You? Well, that&#39;d be right...the fairies are here too.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> ...This place leads to the Eastern Vein Corridor, Odovena. The Odovena is Britain&#39;s leyline cavern...</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> ...you can get to any city without going up to the surface...if you wish to escape, use it well.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> .... Guards. If you have scattered the Queen&#39;s pursuers, remain here for a while.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Remember, do not seek sanctuary from Knocknarea in the north.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> She is generous to those who come, but ruthless to those who leave.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> As a ruler, she&#39;s no better than Morgan. If you must seek help, go to the Round Tables in the south—ugh...!</p><p><strong>Sheffield Guard:</strong> Lord Boggart! Please rest!</p><p><strong>Sheffield Guard:</strong> Leave it to us, the people of Sheffield, your people, we will protect them!</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> ...the people of...Sheffield...</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> For 100 years...I came here, stirred by the anger of being driven out of Norwich...</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> ...I had it better than I thought...I now realize that.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> ...I had land, had people...had a burning purpose.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> ......Oh, indeed, I hated Morgan. I hated Woodwose, I hated Spriggan.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> I desired the throne of the Fairy Kingdom for vengeance, but...</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> I wanted to protect Norwich...I really did.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> I wanted to live up to the expectations of me as a lord. I wanted to save my people. More than anything—</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> I wanted to return to my hometown. That bustling city of sea breeze and busy craftsmen...</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> ...I wonder why. I thought I hated that restless place.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Are you familiar with these strange feelings, Child of Prophecy?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Yes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...It&#39;s called homesickness. From the beginning, you...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Lord Boggart, you raised your troops just to save Norwich.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> Ha.... it&#39;s as if...you can see right through me, hahaha.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> You, the “Child of Prophecy”, who despises war. What happened to that “Iron Cylinder”...?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> She shook her head. I wonder if Boggart noticed the look on her face.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> ...I see...I have given you an excuse to escape.</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> ...I never had any doubt about myself as a lord, but...</p><p><strong>Boggart:</strong> .... Mash. Until the very end, to you I was never—</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> And so, Boggart drew his final breath in peace.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The fairies mourned the loss of their lord, and felt the anxiety of what might happen tomorrow crashing down on them.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Muffled air filled the cave. In the midst of it all, she alone looked up with strength.</p><p><strong>Sheffield Guard:</strong> Lady Mash, that shield in your hand...what are you going to do...?</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Well, you&#39;re not Boggart&#39;s wife anymore. So? What are you going to do from now on, Mash?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m heading to Norwich.</p><p><strong>Sheffield Guard:</strong> Lady Mash!? No, are you going to Norwich all by yourself!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. Not because I am the Child of Prophecy. I&#39;m going to save Norwich from the danger it faces.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s what I want to do most now. It feels as if it is my duty.</p><p><strong>Sheffield Guard:</strong> That&#39;s...in that case, we will accompany you! We have to protect the Child of Prophecy!</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> How-ev-er! Your job is to guard the people.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> I get how you feel, but if you&#39;re so heartless, Boggart will definitely come back to haunt you, don&#39;t you think?</p><p><strong>Sheffield Guard:</strong> Well, that&#39;s...that&#39;s true, isn&#39;t it! But is it really okay to go alone, Lady Mash?</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> She&#39;s not alone, I&#39;m with her. Besides, I&#39;ll be able to show her the way.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Wolfie! I knew you&#39;d be following me still!</p><p><strong>White Wolf:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The wolf did not give a single howl, but merely turned it&#39;s back on Mash and walked away.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Deeper and deeper into the cave. Into the long, dark labyrinth they knew as Odovena. .</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Eh, leaving already? You&#39;re so impatient. But well, we don&#39;t have much time, so we should hurry up.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Using the Vein Corridor, it will take no less than a week to get to Norwich.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> There&#39;s no telling when the rumored “Calamity Pool” will come alive. We can&#39;t afford to waste any time.</p><p><strong>Sheffield Guard:</strong> ...That&#39;s right. Odovena is a perilous place.</p><p><strong>Sheffield Guard:</strong> We would be a burden to Lady Mash.</p><p><strong>Sheffield Guard:</strong> ...We wish you the best of luck, Lady Mash. You have our gratitude for saving Lord Boggart.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> —Yes. But it is I who should be grateful for everything.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Please, everyone, don&#39;t make any rash decisions. Take good care of yourself.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I am the knight of Sheffield, leave saving Norwich to me!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> And so, she departed on her journey, this time in the truest sense of the word.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> She would have various adventures in the Vein Corridor, but I&#39;ll spare you the details for the sake of brevity.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> After breaking through the labyrinth, and meeting with all kinds of different fairies, this lone Child of Prophecy would arrive at the city of her destiny, Norwich.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> To find out what would happen there, and what happens after—you&#39;ll just have to wait for the rest of the story!</p><h2 id="section-8-river-of-dracae" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-8-river-of-dracae" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 8: River of Dracae</h2><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> And that&#39;s all there is to know about the current situation in Britain!

After all, that&#39;s what happened to Sheffi—</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> No, forget I said anything. It was a slip of the tongue.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Now&#39;s the time to gather allies. I strongly advise that we head to Norwich next.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Don&#39;t you agree, Fujimaru? I heard your proclamation earlier, after all.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> You know it too, right? As the “Child of Prophecy”, Artoria lacks both self-confidence and...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Accomplishments.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Exactly! As a savior, nothing is more important than having “saved a city”!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> True strength.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> ...no, well, it&#39;s good to be strong, but I&#39;m talking about something else. You know, that thing.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> ...if you would, da Vinci?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The accomplishment of having “saved a city”. Artoria isn&#39;t a knight who fights alone.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> If she&#39;s to lead a large number of fairies, reputation matters more than strength.</p><hr><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> I see. If we can repel this Calamity, where even Queen Morgan has thrown in the towel,</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> the Child of Prophecy will no longer be but a mere rumor, and instead become reality. There wouldn&#39;t be anyone left who would doubt Artoria.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I&#39;m sure you&#39;re right, but...umm...I wonder if the current me could really purify the Calamity Pool...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Without a doubt! You can do anything with that vigor you displayed at the auction house!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Worst case scenario, you&#39;ll get hit and shatter into a million pieces! I&#39;ll be right there to pick up your remains if you do!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> You&#39;ve got this far being reckless, haven&#39;t you? Isn&#39;t that right, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> With the same energy, you can do it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> If anything, getting shattered is when the real fight begins.</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I&#39;ll have you know, I&#39;m actually really cautious!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> That&#39;s right! Zooooooom!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Artoria is a bear full of courage, vigor, and the power to lead us forward!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> She&#39;ll absolutely, absoluuuuutely be able to do something about Norwich, no doubt about it!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Let&#39;s get going right away, and start on our journey! Our destination is Norwich, the City of Calamity!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> To save Britain, with all of our powers combined!</p><p><strong>Everyone else:</strong> ...who are you!?</p><p><strong>I：???:</strong> Hello, nice to meet you! I&#39;m Gareth!</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> Gareth the Wanderer, aspiring to be Artoria&#39;s squire!</p><p><strong>Welsh Fairy:</strong></p><p><ruby><img src="https://i.imgur.com/vQCGvDe.png" alt="welsh1-light"><rt>Here you go, here you go!</rt></ruby></p><p><ruby><img src="https://i.imgur.com/vQCGvDe.png" alt="welsh1-light"><rt>Lunch, lunch!</rt></ruby></p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> Aha. Thank you again for the food today. (Munch munch munch. )</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> Both the fruit that you gave me yesterday and today are absolutely delicious, thank you! The forest here is truly wonderful!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Sorry, but could we return to our earlier conversation? In summary, so far you&#39;ve—</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> Yes! I&#39;ve been following you since your time in Gloucester!</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> Ah, since you attended the auction, to be exact! Even against an enemy like Tristan, someone that every fairy fears,</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> you took her verbal slugfest head on, cool as a cucumber! And then even had a magecraft duel, like KABOOM!</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> “I ate my vegetables every day for sixteen years! ” “Go back to school and start from scratch! ”</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> Yes...Just thinking back on it, your choice of words filled me with determination!</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> That&#39;s when I became convinced! Artoria is the lord whom I will serve!</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> And of course, I&#39;ve been spying on what you&#39;ve been doing since the auction, too!</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> Artoria was always the first to lend a hand, no matter how suspicious the person asking for help was!</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> I don&#39;t know anyone in Britain these days who would be so trusting towards other fairies!</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> I don&#39;t know much about Ainsel&#39;s prophecy, or even the rumors going around, but...</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> Artoria. I know that you are the one destined to save Britain.</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> So please...let me join you on your pilgrimage.</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> I&#39;m a low-class fairy who has been wandering from city to city, but I, Gareth, will make myself useful for sure...!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Umm, uhhh...what should I do, guys?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I&#39;m not the great fairy she makes me out to be, and being called a lord is just so...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Artoria. You&#39;re smiling, you&#39;re definitely smiling!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Huh, really!? Wait wait, deep breaths, take deep breaths!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (This is definitely Gareth...)</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> (Yeah. Gareth, also known as Beaumains. One of the Knights of the Round Table in pan-human history. )</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> (But let&#39;s just keep quiet about that for now. After all, Artoria looks genuinely happy! )</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> ...Can I ask you something? Why do you want to be Artoria&#39;s squire?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> You said you don&#39;t care about Ainsel&#39;s prophecy, or the rumors going around.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> So, you don&#39;t believe in the “Child of Prophecy”. That being the case, what is it that you see in Artoria?</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> That&#39;s...well, yes.</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> ...To tell you the truth, I&#39;ve been wandering for so long, I don&#39;t even know what kind of fairy I am.</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> I&#39;m not part of the Wind Clan, nor the Earth Clan, nor the Fang Clan. I&#39;m no good at any of that kind of stuff.</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> But ever since I was born, I&#39;ve had this “purpose” in my heart...</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> This time, I will protect everyone. This time, I want to become a fairy who can fight for real.</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> ...I want to actually help those who are suffering. That&#39;s the purpose in my heart right now.</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> But I&#39;m not very strong, so the only thing I&#39;ve been able to do is be patient.</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> I managed to get my hands on an iron weapon, and I&#39;d been managing to defeat some of the Mors.</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> At the same time, I saw some Fairy Knights working for Her Majesty from afar. And then I thought, from the bottom of my heart,</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> “I want to become a knight like that, too. ”</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> I want to become a knight who protects everyone, and become powerful enough to serve a ruler whom I really respect.</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> But soon after, I heard that Her Majesty Morgan was actually a bad ruler, and that the Fairy Knights were just knights who can defeat the Mors...</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> And so, I was convinced that my dream would never come true, as long as Britain stays the way it is.</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> However!</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> When I heard there was an auction for a fairy who would save Britain, I snuck in at the last possible moment.</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> After my fateful encounter with Artoria, my dream of becoming a knight came true!</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> Err, no, I haven&#39;t fulfilled my dream yet, but...it feels like I have.</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> Well, that&#39;s all I have to say!</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> I hope you understand why I want to serve Artoria now!</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I see. Well, it can&#39;t be helped.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I suspected that she was a spy sent by Morgan, but there&#39;s no way someone this awkward and clumsy works for her.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> And it looks like Artoria and Fujimaru support you.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> So of course, I support you too. The more people we have on our side, the better. Let&#39;s work together from now on, Gareth.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Also, you mentioned you didn&#39;t know what kind of fairy you were, but I guess that&#39;s all sorted now.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> You&#39;re the first subject of Artoria. Gareth, the “apprentice knight”.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Nice combination! We did it, Gareth!</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> Yes! We may have been an inch from certain defeat, but that was a total victory!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You two are really getting along well!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> They seem to be about the same age too. Are you jealous, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What&#39;s an Okikuchan?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Yeah, I have a bad feeling about this...I hope it&#39;s not the first in a series to come.</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I have never seen a fairy like that before. Maybe it was a stray fairy who made this place its territory?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Either way, good work everyone.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Fujimaru, da Vinci, and Artoria can return to the carriage.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Gareth and Muramasa, can you continue guarding Red Rab-bit for now?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Without proper protection, we&#39;re sitting ducks for bandits and beasts alike.</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> Leave it to me! Running is my specialty!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Da Vinci would attract the wrong kind of attention. We need someone who exudes toughness, I guess, huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> At this pace, how long will it take to get to Norwich?</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> About two days or so, I believe. That is, assuming there&#39;s no trouble along the way.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Sure, stray fairy attacks like the one we just encountered don&#39;t really count, that&#39;s just par for the course.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> What we should be worrying about is running into the Queen&#39;s guard patrols. They are also the reason why we don&#39;t go any faster than this.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> A carriage going down the road in a hasty manner is an obvious case of someone running away from something, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> If they stopped us and looked in the carriage, we wouldn&#39;t be able to fool them.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The Child of Prophecy...are you saying there are wanted posters of Artoria out there?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> No, not of Artoria. They would just see her as another country fairy.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> It&#39;s Fujimaru who would be in danger.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> In most cases, it&#39;s strictly forbidden for non-military personnel to go outside the city.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> They would question [♂ him /♀ her] about which clan they belong to, and they would find out the truth.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Just like a police questioning...Morgan even has that stuff figured out.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Right. That&#39;s why we&#39;re maintaining this speed. We&#39;ll only let it fly when we&#39;re “completely hostile”.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> By the way, Artoria, is this your first visit to Norwich?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Yeah, it&#39;s my first! Norwich, the city of blacksmiths! I&#39;ve always wanted to go there!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Huh? But, don&#39;t fairies hate iron?</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> The Wind Clan does, but the Earth Clan treats it as a commodity.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Fairies hate “weapons made of iron”,</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> but when used in everyday items or constructions, they&#39;re not so averse to it.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Well, frequent handling of iron may get you complaints from those in the neighborhood, but that&#39;s just proof of your ability as a craftsman!</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Hmm, it&#39;ll be your first time in Norwich, so I&#39;m sorry you&#39;ll be seeing it in such a shocking state, but...</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> To be perfectly honest, this will be the first major turning point.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I believe Britain&#39;s fate will be decided by how well we fare in Norwich.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> See, it&#39;s just as the prophecy said:</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> “A city of iron, a sea of soot. When the calamity is repelled, the pilgrimage will be hailed. ”</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That&#39;s definitely about Norwich, isn&#39;t it? The prophecy of the Child of Prophecy might be abstract 80% of the time,</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> but that line very clearly indicates a “where” and “what”.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Both for us, and for Artoria alike, it&#39;s a battle that we cannot afford to lose.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Right. Whether real or fake, the Child of Prophecy must save Norwich.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> However, on the other hand, you could argue that no calamity will strike Norwich until the Child of Prophecy arrives there.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> In that case, there&#39;s no need for us to worry too much right now.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> This might be our last chance at a peaceful journey, so let&#39;s just enjoy it while we can.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Oh, right. This will be Fujimaru&#39;s first time east of Salisbury too, right?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> We&#39;ll be passing Oxford soon. I&#39;d suggest you get a good look.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Oxford is the home of Woodwose, chief of the Fang Clan. The city houses another bell that the Child of Prophecy must toll.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Huh, aren&#39;t we going to stop by?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Sure, I&#39;d love to show you around the restaurant district by the main street, but Woodwose is a very violent man. If we meet, there will inevitably be a battle.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> He wouldn&#39;t even try to test our mettle like Muryan did.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> There would be no room for talking it out...so I guess Oxford&#39;s is a bell that must be rung by force?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> You&#39;re right. It would be impossible for us to ring the bell there without the use of force.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Although the appearance of the Fairy Knights has diminished the extent of Woodwose&#39;s authority, the Fang Clan remains the dominating force in the Fairy Kingdom.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> We won&#39;t be able to take on Oxford for quite some time still.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...and we would turn the city into a battlefield?</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> ...Well, that&#39;s the thing. You could say that&#39;s what ringing the bells is all about.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Aurora and Muryan are exceptions in that they don&#39;t want to turn their cities into battlefields.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> But from the very start, Oxford is a place of bloodshed.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> In year 800 of the Queen&#39;s Calendar, about 1,200 years ago now, this area was the domain of the Wing Clan.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> But the Fang clan took it from them by force, and killed all the members of the Wing Clan.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> In other words, Muryan in Gloucester is...</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> There may have been others in the clan who survived, but...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> From what I&#39;ve heard, Muryan is one of the sole survivors of the Wing Clan.</p><p>~Oxford, the Clan Head&#39;s private chambers~</p><p><strong>Fang Fairy:</strong> Welcome back, Lord Woodwose. Thank you for your service at Camelot.</p><p><strong>Woodwose:</strong> Hmph, what a waste. Forced to spend my time in such inconclusive meetings.</p><p><strong>Woodwose:</strong> The number of tagalongs have also increased. Year by year, Her Majesty&#39;s audiences become increasingly suffocating.</p><p><strong>Woodwose:</strong> No, that&#39;s not the issue. The issue is the other clans!</p><p><strong>Woodwose:</strong> Spriggan and I are the only heads who attend!</p><p><strong>Woodwose:</strong> Knocknarea the rebel, Muryan the coward, and Ainsel, who remains forever in hiding!</p><p><strong>Woodwose:</strong> They only care about their own wants and needs, with no regard for the future of this realm! The only sane heads remaining are me and Aurora!</p><p><strong>Fang Fairy:</strong> So it is, indeed. Lord Woodwose is a patriot who truly concerns himself with the Fairy Kingdom.</p><p><strong>Fang Fairy:</strong> Please, as soon as you can, you should proceed with your marriage plans with Her Majesty...</p><p><strong>Woodwose:</strong> M-mm. That&#39;s right. The king of the Fairy Kingdom should be a man of strength.</p><p><strong>Woodwose:</strong> And yet, Beryl Gut...!</p><p><strong>Woodwose:</strong> While we were carefully laying the groundwork, he swooped in and took Her Majesty&#39;s hand as if it were his to take!</p><p><strong>Woodwose:</strong> The fact that he claims to be a “foreign magus” matters not, why should I be deceived by a mere human!</p><p><strong>Fang Fairy:</strong> ...L-Lord Woodwose...</p><p><strong>Human Guard:</strong> Excuse me, Lord of Oxford! I am here to report on the resource management at the ranch!</p><p><strong>Woodwose:</strong> —</p><p><strong>Fang Fairy:</strong> (Manoy...what awful timing...after all the trouble you went through to become a soldier...)</p><p><strong>Human Guard:</strong> Uh, uhm...Lord of Oxford. I&#39;d l-like to state my report, if I may.</p><p><strong>Woodwose:</strong> I do not care. Speak.</p><p><strong>Human Guard:</strong> Sir! Of the 60 humans housed at the West Ranch, 10 were sent to Camelot, and the remaining 50...</p><p><strong>Woodwose:</strong> Were sent here. Hm...Well, that&#39;s good. With 50 men, we&#39;ll be able to let everyone with advancing Mors symptoms—</p><p><strong>Human Guard:</strong> About that...it&#39;s...the remaining 50 were all taken to Manchester, into Gawain&#39;s custody.</p><p><strong>Human Guard:</strong> She said they were in need of re-education. .</p><p><strong>Woodwose:</strong> She can&#39;t do that! She confiscated them, that brat!</p><p><strong>Human Guard:</strong> Hyaa!?</p><p><strong>Fang Fairy:</strong> P-please calm down, Lord Woodwose...! The soldier merely stated his report!</p><p><strong>Woodwose:</strong> Quiet! Why should we suffer so for the sake of such a fragile being!?</p><p><strong>Woodwose:</strong> We can increase the number of humans as we wish, and yet the Queen hasn&#39;t increased the number of shipments at all!</p><p><strong>Fang Fairy:</strong> That&#39;s...because only humans with emotions have functioning creativity that can nurture us fairies...</p><p><strong>Woodwose:</strong> We cannot afford such flexibility in Britain right now!</p><p><strong>Woodwose:</strong> The Mors grow in number every day! If we don&#39;t increase our manpower, this city will be devoured!</p><p><strong>Woodwose:</strong> Or does the Queen think that it&#39;s of no issue, as long as she has her Fairy Knights!?</p><p><strong>Woodwose:</strong> You have no idea about the hardships our Fang clan has gone through to fight for our Queen...!</p><p><strong>Human Guard:</strong> —</p><p><strong>Fang Fairy:</strong> ...Lord Woodwose...</p><p><strong>Woodwose:</strong> Huuu...</p><p><strong>Woodwose:</strong> ...Be composed...be tolerant...for I am a warrior worthy of serving my Queen...</p><p><strong>Woodwose:</strong> Discard of the body. I will be having dinner.</p><p><strong>Woodwose:</strong> Aurora has brought some good wine. It seems the Wind Clan is also struggling to survive.</p><p><strong>Fang Fairy:</strong> J-just like that...</p><p><strong>Fang Fairy:</strong> ...Manoy...you were a talented chef...but you said you wanted to be of help to Lord Woodwose, despite being human...</p><p><strong>Fang Fairy:</strong> If fairies and humans are so different...then why can&#39;t humans know their place...?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> This was the third one...Exterminating monster cats is not exactly my forte...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Since we spent the night by Oxford, we&#39;ve been on the road for two days...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> The animals are growing increasingly ferocious here. Could it be because we&#39;re so close to the Great Pit?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Great Pit...you mean the one you can see over there?</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Right, the Great Pit at the center of Britain.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> And that wall rising up on its north side, as if to shelter the Great Pit, is Camelot Castle.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> The capital of sin, Camelot, where Her Majesty Queen Morgan resides.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That Great Pit...Mike told me about it. He said it was a place to dispose of sinister things.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> A fairy who lost their name may vanish from the city and end up in the forest in the west of the island.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> However, some things are simply no longer needed, or just cannot be gotten rid of or destroyed. Things that are simply obstructions.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Such unwanted things are what we might call non-combustible waste. That hole is a place for disposing of such things.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It looks pretty deep, but I wonder just how deep it is. Could you tell, Muramasa?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Oh, that? It&#39;s likely near 10,000 meters deep.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> I fell in, but didn&#39;t reach the bottom. As I fell, Lancelot blew me off course.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Thankfully, I was able to catch myself on the wall.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Ten thousand!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That&#39;s as deep as the Mariana Trench!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Fujimaru, how do you know how deep the Mariana Trench is?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Is there a connection here, or what?</p><hr><p><strong>Red Rabbit:</strong> My friends, please stop talking about the Great Pit. You&#39;ll bring bad luck over yourself and me alike listening to this.</p><p><strong>Red Rabbit:</strong> That Great Pit is something “everyone knows” of in the Fairy Kingdom, but “nobody should speak of”.</p><p><strong>Red Rabbit:</strong> It is simply bad luck. Do you remember the fairies who had gone there to dump their waste?</p><p><strong>Red Rabbit:</strong> They are ones who have sinned, and been put in charge of the Great Pit as punishment. The Pilgrims of the Landfill.</p><p><strong>Red Rabbit:</strong> Regular fairies shouldn&#39;t even be looking at the hole, so just forget about it.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Pilgrims in spite of being offenders...that&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> It&#39;s strange, isn&#39;t it? I thought it was strange too.</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> I don&#39;t understand why they&#39;re called pilgrims in the first place. “Pilgrim” is a word coined for the sake of the Child of Prophecy, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> A memento left behind by the six fairies who were there in the beginning.</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> They were enshrined, and the bell towers are a means of representing our roots.</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> And so, I heard that Ainsel named this journey to the bell tower shrines in order to govern the clans a “pilgrimage”.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I see. That&#39;s right, there shouldn&#39;t be such a concept as a “pilgrimage” in the Fairy Kingdom.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It&#39;s something made up specifically for the Child of Prophecy. That makes sense.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Huh? In Fujimaru&#39;s world...in pan-human history, is “pilgrimage” a common word?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yeah. Religion...you&#39;re not familiar with that, are you?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> If many people believe in, find salvation in, and cooperate under a single teaching...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> If those people were to travel to the place where that teaching originated...to them, that place would be sacred,</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> and that&#39;s what you&#39;d call a “pilgrimage”. In our world, it&#39;s something anyone can do.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It is the simplest and most important ritual you can partake in.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Anyone! You don&#39;t have to be chosen by a prophecy to go on a pilgrimage!</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> That&#39;s the beauty of pan-human history. Everyone is equal, and no one is special.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Even if you do something bad, you can be forgiven if you atone for your misdeeds. And even if you&#39;ve done something good, you can still be punished for your wrongdoings.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Basically, it&#39;s a world of discussion. Though it&#39;s not always that simple.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> What happens today carries over to tomorrow, and what happens tomorrow carries over to the next day.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> There&#39;s no “eternity” or “change” the same way there is for fairies, so the outside world is constantly changing.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Woah—I see. It really is a very human land, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> As someone who is always falling behind, I think a world where everyone helps each other out sounds really nice.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> No, everyone in the Fairy Kingdom are alike, so we shouldn&#39;t bother comparing who&#39;s better!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;re right.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> At least Britain is lovely.</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> What about you, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Ah, what? Did I ask that in a strange way just now maybe?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I just want to know how you feel about your own world.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> How do you see yourself in the future, is what I&#39;m trying to ask...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Oh, like that...</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Yeah, like that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I don&#39;t know how to put it, but...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I think I&#39;ll like it as much as anyone else...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I think it makes me just a little anxious...</p><hr><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Oh, that&#39;s a surprise! The Fairy Kingdom has splendid bridges too—</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> —hold up, is that it?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> It&#39;s awful, the entire thing has collapsed from the piers up. Did they make a mistake in the structural analysis of the framework or something?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Some time ago, there was a rainy season in the Fairy Kingdom. The river probably flooded,</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> and that in combination with the Mors&#39; violent rampages probably lead to this.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> But we have other issues. On the other side of this “River of Tears”, beyond that hill, you can see Norwich, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Is the river too deep to cross?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Yes, it&#39;s much deeper than it seems. According to some it&#39;s even bottomless.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Can fairy carriages fly...or something?</p><p><strong>Red Rabbit:</strong> Flying would be nonsensical! What do you think the ground is for!?</p><p><strong>Red Rabbit:</strong> Romance! Romance needs to be considered! Even had I wings, I would run on the ground! That&#39;s just how I am!</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> S-sure? I don&#39;t really get it, but I&#39;ve received your complaint.</p><hr><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> So this is the end for the carriage then? Thank you for your service, Red Rab-bit!</p><p><strong>Red Rabbit:</strong> What was that, you dog-eared mutt!? In this moment, I am Fujimaru&#39;s faithful steed.</p><p><strong>Red Rabbit:</strong> On our journey here, as I composed my poems, I swore to accompany [♂ him /♀ her] until the end of [♂ his /♀ her] journey.</p><p><strong>Red Rabbit:</strong> I would rather beat you here and now and return home, than be left behind by you lot.</p><p><strong>Red Rabbit:</strong> I hope that you will remember that I am prepared to go to such lengths, neigh-bour.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> The River of Tears...! Then, this must be the river of Dracae!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> What&#39;s that? Dracae? I recall there was a fairy of that name in pan-human history, however...</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> The Fairy Deadlord, Dracae. A great fairy once known as the Holy Grail of Water.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Her special trait was to “summon the treasures one desired”...</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Well, it&#39;d be easier if you just saw it, right? Look over there.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> See all those fairies hanging around under the bridge? They&#39;re likely searching for Dracae as well.</p><p><strong>Earth Fairy:</strong> If you go into the river, you can&#39;t get out? That&#39;s because you guys are weak!</p><p><strong>Earth Fairy:</strong> Out of the way, cowards, I&#39;ll go first! Dracae, Dracae, can you hear my voice?</p><p><strong>Earth Fairy:</strong> What I wish for is a “silver axe”! I accidentally misplaced mine recently!</p><p><strong>Earth Fairy:</strong> I&#39;d appreciate if you could bring me a new one—I knew it, yahoo! It&#39;s coming!</p><p><strong>Fang Fairy:</strong> I-it&#39;s not exactly what I wished for, but...</p><p><strong>Fang Fairy:</strong> Lord Woodwose ordered me to procure a hair ornament that would suit Lady Aurora...</p><p><strong>Fang Fairy:</strong> If I could get a “rainbow-colored hair piece” or something...ah, no way, something&#39;s actually coming...</p><p><strong>Fang Fairy:</strong> ...I need to get it...need to get it...but all fairies who enter the river of Dracae, they all...</p><p><strong>Fang Fairy:</strong> Aah, my hand, something just...haa, something just grabbed me!? No, I knew it! I don&#39;t want it!</p><p><strong>Fang Fairy:</strong> I don&#39;t want it! This isn&#39;t what I wished for! Help me, somebody! Uwaaaaaa!</p><p><strong>Red Rabbit:</strong> Pardon me, may I leave you all here and go live with my parents?</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> Can you just keep your horse ears shut for a bit? You&#39;re ruining the story.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> As you can see, Dracae is a most dangerous Fairy Deadlord.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> “She lures you to the river with the treasures you desire, and once you grab them, she pulls you into the river to kill you. ”</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> You could call it the scales of desire and life. That bridge was probably made to avoid Dracae.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> So, it&#39;s dangerous to even be near the river.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> However, we simply continue on foot from here, then.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> I&#39;ll carry Fujimaru and we can jump across the decrepit bridge.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> How about it, Artoria and Gareth? Could you make that jump?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Don&#39;t be absurd, Muramasa. How many meters is that even–</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> No problem, Gareth can handle it! I&#39;m quite good at jumping, you see!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> O-o-of course I could too, just like that, va-voom! Wouldn&#39;t be a problem! I&#39;m the Child of Prophecy!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hmm, it&#39;s not that I couldn&#39;t jump it, but I&#39;m a bit unsure.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Oberon, this river, can it really be crossed like that?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> No, it can&#39;t. The “treasures” would appear in the stream in the middle of the jump.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> If you were to see any of it, that would be it. You would dive straight into the river.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Ah...I see. It seems I underestimated the Mystery of this fairy...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> See what I mean, Muramasa!? You&#39;ve got to think about what you&#39;re doing, Muramasa!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Stay, Artoria. Stay.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> S-sorry...it&#39;s just... Muramasa just reminds me of the old man from my village, so I just...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Then, we&#39;ll have to go around the river. Is it possible to go upstream?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> So, we&#39;ll have to go around the river?</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Right, if we go upstream, we&#39;ll be outside of Dracae&#39;s territory.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> We&#39;ll lose about half a day doing so, but it&#39;s better than taking any risks.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Just don&#39;t look at the river. If you see “something you want”, ignore it even if it comes near you.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Dracae is invincible within the river, but she&#39;ll never leave it either.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> As long as we stay away, there won&#39;t be any problems.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> ...“Treasures” floating up...uhm, Oberon.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> If we were able to ignore what came down the stream, couldn&#39;t we then cross the river without having to worry?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> No, as long as Dracae has magical energy, “treasures” will keep flowing endlessly.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> If we try to just ignore them, we&#39;ll be locked in a constant struggle against Dracae.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> ...I guess something like that could work.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> It&#39;s not so much something “you want”, more something you would give your life for.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Since we as a group have high aspirations of saving Norwich,</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> we might not be enchanted by Dracae&#39;s “treasures”. We might be able to force our way across.</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> Ah! Something&#39;s coming down the stream! Is that—</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> An Artoria plushiiieee!</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> There&#39;s no way you&#39;re not a dog fairy!</p><p><strong>Red Rabbit:</strong> A carrot over TWO METERS long!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Is that—no way, a Holy Grail!?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Grails are coming up the stream!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But that&#39;s nothing! A Grail or two now and then isn&#39;t too rare!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Don&#39;t underestimate Fujimaru&#39;s self-control–</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Is that a dozen Grails!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I can&#39;t get them out of my head...guh!</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> This is bad. I didn&#39;t imagine it would be this good at nailing people&#39;s desires...however, I am the renaissance genius, Leonardo da Vinci.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> No matter what, I won&#39;t be coerced–</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Dinosaur fossils—!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> How the hell did you guys ever make it through five Lostbelts!?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> No, that&#39;s not it. That&#39;s just how strong Dracae is!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Don&#39;t look at the river, Artoria! I&#39;m going to save those idiots who got dragged down!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Normally I wouldn&#39;t, but right now I am an imitation, so there&#39;s nothing I want!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Eh—ah, really!? Are you really that lacking in greed, Muramasa!?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Don&#39;t look over here, you idiot! The river&#39;s right there!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> —Oh.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> We just lost five people in under a minute! What are we gonna do, Muramasa!?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> ...that thing just now, was that really what she wished for?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> You&#39;ve gotta be kidding me—</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Oh, Oberon! Go find a rope and toss it into the river!</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Like there&#39;d be something as convenient as a rope...ah, crap, I looked at the river too!</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I&#39;ve done it now! What the hell is that coming down the river!?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Magical energy sold out!?</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Hey, what do you have to say for yourselves, you morons? I&#39;ll give you one chance before I bonk you over the head.</p><p><strong>Everyone else:</strong> You seeeeee,</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> there was no way we weren&#39;t gonna get that stuff!</p><hr><p><strong>Everyone else:</strong> Ouch!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Do you really have no remorse!? When we deal with things in Norwich, you&#39;ll have an entire day of zazen to look forward to, you hear that!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Muramasa&#39;s so strict...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> By the way, Fujimaru, what&#39;s zazen?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> A discipline to make you feel calm and refreshed.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> That&#39;s so interesting! I wonder if the soul ever separates from the body!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> A discipline to make you feel refreshed through beating.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> T-that&#39;s a really special kind of training...it&#39;s too early for me to try that, I think.... haha...</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Aaaah! I thought I got the treasure, but it&#39;s gone!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You tricked us all along, Dracae!</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> For real...my Artoria figure disappeared too...I lost it when Muramasa whacked me...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Just as I thought. Basically, there&#39;s no way someone could manage to prepare the things everyone desires.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> What you saw was merely a figment of your imagination. It was all just foam in the water.</p><p><strong>Red Rabbit:</strong> Your sweet tongue always knows what to say. Your sweet tongue.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> O-oh, thank you.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Well, hopefully you&#39;ve learned from this that not all that glitters is gold.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;ll think about what I&#39;ve done...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Now what?</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> It seems like we&#39;re at the bottom of the river...but I can&#39;t even see the surface if I look up.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> This is without a doubt the fairy territory of Dracae.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Swimming straight up to get out...it&#39;s not something that will allow that.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> We won&#39;t be able to return to the surface unless we deal with Dracae.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Well, now that it dragged all of you down here, I expect it to come to us...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> What kind of fairy is Dracae even? Is she human-like? Fish-like?</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> A mermaid, they say...although, no fairy that&#39;s been dragged in has ever returned, so...</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> Oh, but I&#39;ve heard it attacks more humans than fairies! She drags men down to make them her lovers!</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> They say that if you&#39;re human, you&#39;ll be let go before she kills you, and that&#39;s how the name Dracae came about in the first place.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Huh? Make them her lovers? As in, get hitched?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> So when Dracae lures her prey to the river, she&#39;s looking for someone to marry...is what you&#39;re saying?</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> Yes! She&#39;s the terrible marriage hunting fairy!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...Hmm. That&#39;s just like our Dracae in pan-human history.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Yours, you mean...Dracae existed there as well?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yeah. It&#39;s part of folklore passed down throughout Europe.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> She disguised herself as gold rings and dishes floating downstream, then dragged in men who would come to pick them up.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> However, she wasn&#39;t just trying to find a lover. Dracae&#39;s purpose was to—</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Wish...wish...my...purpose...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I beg of you...beg of you...please, I...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Far...I have...searched...this...world　to...looked in vain...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> AA—AA—aaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> She&#39;s coming, get ready! If she&#39;s attacking us, we have to respond! We can finish that thought later!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> From the looks of it, this thing&#39;s serious! Don&#39;t be caught off guard, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Dracae:</strong> Nowhere.... nowhere...why...why...</p><p><strong>Dracae:</strong> What is...wish for...don&#39;t know...don&#39;t know...don&#39;t know...</p><p><strong>Dracae:</strong> But...a dream...saw...my...treasure...</p><p><strong>Dracae:</strong> My...love...my...</p><p><strong>Dracae:</strong> My...baby—</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> Dracae is dispersing...But, uhm...</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> What&#39;s that “bae bie” she mentioned? Do you know, Artoria?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> No, I&#39;ve never heard that word either. Baybie...(glances)...baby?</p><p><strong>Red Rabbit:</strong> I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re looking at me like that, I have never heard of such a thing either.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> No, &quot;baby&quot;, as in</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...Yeah. Just as I thought, it seems.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Fujimaru, let&#39;s discuss this later, just the two of us. Alright?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Huh? S-sure, got it.</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> The flow of mana is normalizing! Dracae&#39;s fairy territory seems to be rescinding!</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> We did it! —guh—</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> Blub, blublub, blublublub! Blublub—</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Bluuubblub! Blububulub! Blublublubda!</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I see. You fought Dracae at the bottom of the river and defeated her.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Then as you were having a casual conversation, you didn&#39;t realize the river turned back to normal, and so you almost drowned.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> But you were swept downstream and managed to make it out alive, and then you walked back here.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Is that about right, ladies and gentlemen? Well, I was just here keeping an eye on our stuff, but that&#39;s fine I guess.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Don&#39;t be so down, Oberon. I&#39;m sorry for leaving you here.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Oh, you can put that rope away now. How&#39;d you even find one?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> You have Blanca to thank for that. She flew all the way out here to find us.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Sorry you were left out, Oberon.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Oh, it doesn&#39;t bother me. It&#39;s my fault for being late.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> As an acquaintance of Shakespeare, I simply wanted to be involved if it was a comedy.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You should&#39;ve come in as well.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> No, I&#39;m no good with water...thankfully Dracae&#39;s magical energy was sold out...</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Either way, the threat of Dracae is no more. We can now cross the river.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Red Rab-bit, travel upstream until you find a bridge, then meet us at Norwich.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You stand out. If you remain outside the city, we&#39;ll easily spot you.</p><p><strong>Red Rabbit:</strong> ...It seems that&#39;s how it will have to be. It is unfortunate I cannot offer you a comfortable journey in my carriage.</p><p><strong>Red Rabbit:</strong> Two days! No, as long as I don&#39;t run into some carrots on the way, I shall arrive at Norwich only one day after you.</p><p><strong>Red Rabbit:</strong> Until then, stay safe. And I sincerely ask that you not accept the service of any fairy horse but me.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Well then. The sun will set soon. Let&#39;s hurry across the river.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> We&#39;ll set up camp on the other side to spend the night. Hey, there&#39;s no real rush to begin with.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Norwich is just a stone&#39;s throw away. We&#39;re on schedule, and we&#39;ll be right on time for our destiny.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> Facing such a terrifying enemy, and then getting to taste bread as delicious as this.</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> I hadn&#39;t really given much thought to the importance of a good meal before now, but,</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> it looked so delicious when Artoria ate, and after I tried copying her, I couldn&#39;t stop!</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Come to think of it, Artoria eats a lot for someone from the Wind Clan.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> If you&#39;re looking for someone whose purpose is food, it&#39;d be the Fang Clan. Do you happen to be from the Fang Clan?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> No, I&#39;m actually not from any of the six clans. I&#39;m just a low-class fairy who&#39;s not even good enough to be in a clan.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> My habit of eating so much is because everyone in the village of Tintagel used to give me lots of food.</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> The village of Tintagel!</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> Then, you really did survive Woodwose&#39;s “hunt for the Child of Prophecy”!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> No...well, I did survive, or I guess you could say I managed to escape using Merlin&#39;s magecraft...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> It wasn&#39;t some sort of flashy show...that&#39;s a bit of an embellishment...</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Speaking of which, do you know why restaurants are so prevalent in the Fairy Kingdom, Gareth?</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> N-no, I don&#39;t. I&#39;ve never been let into one...</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> You see, they&#39;re actually a means of suppressing the Fang Clan&#39;s violent urges.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> “The Fang Clan lacks decorum. You are an embarrassment to Her Majesty the Queen&#39;s army. ”</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> “Your cravings will be satisfied through meals. I, Woodwose, will give you an upbringing worthy of this clan. ”</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> More or less. Before they knew it, it had grown into a huge franchise.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Being the owner of a restaurant was suddenly a sign of success in the Fairy Kingdom.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> ...Then, Woodwose fusses over his demeanor and dresses like a human, because...</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Yeah, it&#39;s to draw attention from his own barbarous nature.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> As the chief of the Fang Clan, he has to act like a gentleman, but his true nature remains the same.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> He&#39;s savage, greedy, and the very personification of the Fang Clan, who take pleasure in preying on the weak.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Although that aspect has also calmed down with the rise of the Fairy Knights, so now he&#39;s mostly just an old man with authority.</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> Then, Woodwose isn&#39;t all that strong?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Yeah, he&#39;s just another old-timer by now. You, who defeated Dracae, are much stronger.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> So, we should visit a restaurant after we defeat Woodwose.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I&#39;ve only eaten at one a handful of times myself, but their food is exquisite. Their salads are especially good.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Even battles need their own rewards. I promise you that much, just as we&#39;ll help Artoria.</p><p>Note! Scene Change</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Right, Artoria and Gareth are still over by the campfire talking to Oberon.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Now then, as long as we keep our conversation all the way out here, Artoria and the others shouldn&#39;t be able to overhear us...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> What, am I not supposed to be in on this? I&#39;m also a Servant of pan-human history, aren&#39;t I?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Guess we have no choice...well, I guess we&#39;ll just have to tell Muramasa as well?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Alright, let&#39;s pick up where we left off. We were talking about Dracae in pan-human history.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Dracae would drag the opposite sex into the river, but not because she sought a lover.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Her purpose was to cross-breed with men. In the case of women, they were taken as wet nurses for the children she bore.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Meaning—</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> She didn&#39;t want lovers, she wanted babies...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> She wanted to make children...</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yeah, that&#39;s the goal. But in the case of the Dracae in this world, that has not come to pass.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Even though numerous men have been dragged into the river. Do you know why this is?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Could it be...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Because in the Fairy Kingdom, no children can be born?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That&#39;s the conclusion I came to as well. However, there is a more concerning issue.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> We have learned so far that fairies mimic human society.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It would imply that both of them share the same “way of being”.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> What fairy society lacks, human society also lacks.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> In other words...humans in the Fairy Kingdom don&#39;t have the ability to reproduce naturally.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The concept of “giving birth” is lost here.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I became certain of this when they used terms like “previous generation” and “current generation”, as opposed to “parent” and “child”.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Hold up. It makes sense for fairies to come about naturally. In the first place, they&#39;re like nature&#39;s limbs.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> But how could a human just come into being? They can&#39;t exactly come about by themselves.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Human beings are “produced”.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a technique similar to artificial insemination, or the alchemical process of creating a homunculus.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But they are created “individually”, without parents or siblings, carefully nurtured, and then shipped off.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Of course, marriage customs like “husband” and “wife” exist, but they cannot produce offspring.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That is what it means to be human in this world. From our point of view, it&#39;s something rather inhumane.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But to the fairies in this world...Even to Artoria and Gareth, it would just be how things are. There would be no room to question it.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> At this point I&#39;m not sure what to make of this whole thing...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But if Fujimaru suddenly told them of this, they might be shocked.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It would create tension with Artoria and the others. I suggest we keep this information amongst ourselves.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...I&#39;m fine with that, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...Here, humans are limited to one generation...</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> ...Alright. Is this far away enough?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I don&#39;t want to wake anyone when they&#39;re resting for tomorrow.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Something just flew out of Fujimaru&#39;s tent, but...</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> What was that just now, a bird? It couldn&#39;t be that they...secretly kept a bird, could it?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Oops, I&#39;m sorry. Welcome back, Blanca.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> What&#39;s the situation in Norwich? Will the Calamity strike tomorrow, you think?</p><p><strong>A：Blanca:</strong> —</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Still no signs...I see, just in time...</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> As I thought, Ainsel&#39;s prescience can&#39;t be changed.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> “On the contrary, no Calamity will strike Norwich before the Child of Prophecy arrives”...huh?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> If Artoria arrives there, Norwich will fall. Knowing this, I still brought her here.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I asked her to repel the Calamity and shoulder the fall of Norwich.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> ...What a despicable and cowardly guide I am. I can&#39;t even let those involved determine their own fate.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> ...And yet, until we pass through this, none of it can begin.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> According to the prophecy, the first bell of the pilgrimage is in Norwich.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Alright. Thank you, Blanca. You must be tired, be sure to get some rest.</p><p><strong>A：Blanca:</strong> —</p><p><strong>C：Oberon:</strong> No, I&#39;m not going to tell any of them that we can&#39;t save Norwich.</p><p><strong>C：Oberon:</strong> It&#39;s not their sin to carry. I will shoulder this burden, should I have to.</p><p><strong>C：Oberon:</strong> Don&#39;t beat yourself up over it. It&#39;s all just as foretold, Blanca.</p><p><strong>C：Oberon:</strong> Besides, we&#39;ll have some time before the Calamity strikes, right?</p><p><strong>C：Oberon:</strong> Both Fujimaru and Artoria are in need of some happy memories.</p><p><strong>C：Oberon:</strong> Tomorrow, they can enjoy Norwich at their leisure. Our final battle will commence after that.</p><h2 id="section-9-norwich-i" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-9-norwich-i" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 9: Norwich (I)</h2><p><strong>Human Soldiers:</strong> Hey, old fellow!

Glimmering!</p><p><strong>Human Shop Keeper:</strong> Master Fang, you must have just arrived in Norwich, is that right?</p><p><strong>Human Shop Keeper:</strong> This is the newest menu item thought up by the Count. You won&#39;t even find it in the poshest place in Oxford.</p><p><strong>Human Shop Keeper:</strong> If you think I&#39;m lying, go ahead and try one. Free of charge! It&#39;s from a soup kitchen in the shopping district, after all!</p><p><strong>Well-built Man:</strong> Heeey, where&#39;s that soot-sweeping fairy!?</p><p><strong>Well-built Man:</strong> Is he off loitering somewhere instead of doing his job sweeping up!?</p><p><strong>Street Fairy:</strong> There&#39;s no problem, Master Human. THAT thing is gonna come down soon anyway, right?</p><p><strong>Street Fairy:</strong> The soot will all disappear then. Well, so will your apartment, I guess!</p><p><strong>Well-built Man:</strong> That&#39;s not what I&#39;m talking about!</p><p><strong>Well-built Man:</strong> Even if it rains tomorrow, the windows should be cleaned! Even if there was a storm coming, the garden should be tended to!</p><p><strong>Well-built Man:</strong> Because, next thing you know, you have a new tenant at your door!</p><p><strong>Well-built Man:</strong> You should never miss out on a new customer! That&#39;s what business is all about, you hear me!?</p><p><strong>Street Fairy:</strong> Haha, you&#39;re right! When you&#39;re right up on main street, you gotta have gutters cleaner than even Spriggan&#39;s!</p><p><strong>Street Fairy:</strong> When it comes to money-making principles, you can&#39;t beat human beings after all! Don&#39;t go dying on me, old man!</p><p><strong>Back Alley Fairy:</strong> ...Is this all you made yesterday? You guys aren&#39;t sleeping on the job, are you?</p><p><strong>Back Alley Fairy:</strong> Everyone&#39;s up in arms with all the talk of Morgan abandoning the city.</p><p><strong>Back Alley Fairy:</strong> The guards are even assembling at Spriggan&#39;s tower to patrol there.</p><p><strong>Back Alley Fairy:</strong> This is the perfect opportunity, you get it?</p><p><strong>Back Alley Fairy:</strong> We&#39;ll just borrow a little from those who&#39;ve saved up lots...</p><p><strong>Earth Fairy:</strong> Damn it, the harbor is off-limits! That ocean-going ship is the Fairy Kingdom&#39;s first—</p><p><strong>Earth Fairy:</strong> The Inabamaru&#39;s construction was going so well! Do you wanna lose to the Count&#39;s cutty sark?</p><p><strong>Human Carpenter:</strong> Seems the lumber isn&#39;t gonna come either...What is Lord Spriggan planning...</p><p><strong>Everyone else:</strong> So overwhelming...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So noi—sy!</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Isn&#39;t it? This is Norwich. The only harbor town in all of Fairyland Britain.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> One of the new laws introduced during the Queen&#39;s Calendar was that “no new iron weapons can be crafted”.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> So for nearly 1,900 years, no new “iron weapons” were made in the entire Kingdom.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> However...</p><p><strong>Earth Fairy:</strong> Ooh!? I thought I saw a fairy sticking out like a sore thumb! Is that you, Oberon!?</p><p><strong>Earth Fairy:</strong> You came all the way to Norwich? Even with the sky looking like that!?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Hm? Oh, that little rain cloud over there? You know, I thought the rainy season had already passed.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> But well, one little rain cloud won&#39;t kill the bustling of Norwich, will it, Nack?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> If a place seems interesting or fun, then the clever men are bound to go there.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Norwich is the place to go for a once in a lifetime frenzy, isn&#39;t it? As such, even the Fairy King will attend!</p><p><strong>Earth Fairy:</strong> Ha—haha, quite right! That&#39;s my Oberon!</p><p><strong>Earth Fairy:</strong> Yeah, we&#39;re all a bunch of misfits in Norwich, the city of illegal blacksmiths!</p><p><strong>Earth Fairy:</strong> Compared to the Queen&#39;s hammer, the Calamity Pool is nothing to be afraid of!</p><p><strong>Earth Fairy:</strong> Thank you, and please, stop by my store later! My wife&#39;s a fan of yours!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Hey, hey...that Earth Clan fairy just now, he had an outrageous aura...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> 200, 300 years? Just how many hundreds of years has he been swinging that hammer around?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I see. That fairy...Nack, was it? Just like Muramasa, he seemed totally unreasonable! What an amazing aura!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> No, I didn&#39;t mean it like that...</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Hahaha. Are you interested in Nack? If so, I&#39;ll show you to his forge later.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> As far as I know, he&#39;s a low-class fairy who has lived for nearly 400 years. He&#39;s well versed in the history of blacksmithing in the Fairy Kingdom.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> 400 years! And he&#39;s a low-class fairy!?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> He probably just never lost sight of his “purpose”. He&#39;s still active as a blacksmith, after all.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> That&#39;s what I was trying to say earlier.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> A hundred years ago, Spriggan lifted the ban on iron weapons, and Norwich expanded a lot as a result.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> “Iron weapons” are able to hurt fairies. There would be an increase in homicide...or rather, fairycide, among the fairies.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Such apprehensions were the cause for the ban, but there was turbulence among the fairies in the north and the Mors were growing in number.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Above all else, the processing of iron was absolutely essential to the development of human technology.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Spriggan put such advice of its importance forward to the Queen, who acknowledged it.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Ever since then, Norwich was no longer simply a “city of fairies,” but a “city where the law of smithing came first”.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Salisbury is a place where humans might find freedom from the “rules of the Fairy Kingdom”.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> But Norwich is a place where “all are equal under the rule of smithing”.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Some fairies still use humans as slaves, while others simply value them as skilled craftsmen.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> But more importantly, even some fairies are only treated as labor force by human businessmen.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You&#39;re saying that regular humans are employing the fairies?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Yeah. Not in their shops on the main street, though. You know, like sweatshops.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Fairies are so pure that they&#39;re really easy to swindle.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Exploited until death, dying of overwork without receiving a single Morpound...</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> There are a lot of fairies like that here.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> In simple terms, Norwich is a place where smiths and vices intermingle, you could say. Yeah.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> But that&#39;s what a human city is supposed to be like, isn&#39;t it? The main streets are clean and well-kept, while the back streets are filthy and run-down.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> The chief of the Earth Clan, and the lord of this city, Spriggan, is pushing for such a notion very blatantly.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> It&#39;s almost as if he wants to turn Norwich into a “human city”...or at least that&#39;s what it seems like.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I see...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...A human city, huh...</p><hr><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> Uhm...then, the reason for the Calamity Pool in the sky,</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> is because Norwich is a bad town? Did the Calamity come to this place because bad things happen here?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Not at all. No matter what city you&#39;re in, there&#39;s always gonna be good and bad. That&#39;s not exclusive to Norwich.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> That this is the “location of the Calamity” is simply coincidence.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Right...looks like we still have plenty of time, so let&#39;s enjoy some leisure.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> You&#39;re all free to go wherever you so please.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> After all, we&#39;re here to deal with the Calamity Pool.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> It will only be advantageous to have knowledge of the city we&#39;re meant to be protecting.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yeah, I&#39;d have to agree with that sentiment.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The Calamity Pool...I&#39;d like to gather information about those rain clouds in the sky, as well.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Fujimaru, do you want to come with me?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Of course.</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I&#39;d like to head to the smithy of that Earth Clan fairy from earlier, Nack.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I have some some magecraft items I want to try out. I was hoping a skilled blacksmith could make them for me.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> I&#39;ll come with you. I&#39;m curious about these fairy blacksmiths.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> I&#39;m supposed to be your bodyguard in the first place.</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> Blacksmiths...I think I&#39;d just be in your way if I came along...</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> How about we eat our way around town, then? I need to find a place to stay, though.</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> Can I!? Gareth joins Oberon&#39;s party!</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> It&#39;s settled then. Meet me on the main street at lunchtime.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> In Norwich, they won&#39;t be suspicious of Fujimaru walking around alone.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> However, if the guards were to question [♂ him /♀ her], we&#39;d be in trouble. Please take care of [♂ him /♀ her] should that happen, da Vinci.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I&#39;ll handle it. I&#39;ll assume the role of Fujimaru&#39;s big sister!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Now then. It would be nice to tour around Norwich, but there are a couple things we need to do first.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> First, as I mentioned earlier, is to gather information on the dark cloud above us, the Calamity Pool.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> How much actual damage has it caused at present, and how much damage will it continue to cause henceforth?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> In practice, seeing whether it&#39;s possible to get rid of the rain clouds.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That&#39;s about it for the first one. Other than that, we have one more “thing to do”...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Gather information on Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yeah, I didn&#39;t even have to tell you!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Let&#39;s start going around the shops on the main street.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> We don&#39;t have a lot of time, and we might end up looking a bit suspicious, but we&#39;re going to really have to rush through this!</p><p><strong>Bartering Merchant Fairy:</strong> A human girl in black armor?</p><p><strong>Bartering Merchant Fairy:</strong> Hmm, folks from the Round Table Army stop by here to purchase goods, so I see people in armor on a daily basis, but...</p><p><strong>Bartering Merchant Fairy:</strong> I haven&#39;t seen one that&#39;s both a girl and wears black armor. Oh? But I do think I heard about something like that recently...</p><p><strong>Bartering Merchant Fairy:</strong> Well, now that you&#39;ve come all the way here to talk, why don&#39;t you purchase a copy of my “Child of Prophecy” story?</p><p><strong>Bartering Merchant Fairy:</strong> It has the fight against Gawain at the West Ranch, and the fight against Tristan at Gloucester!</p><p><strong>Bartering Merchant Fairy:</strong> They&#39;re both really exciting, so if you&#39;re interested then I&#39;ll let you buy them for a Morpound!</p><p><strong>Bartering Merchant Fairy:</strong> I am certain that the Child of Prophecy has appeared!</p><p><strong>Bartering Merchant Fairy:</strong> When they come to Norwich, the Calamity Pool will be gone for good!</p><p><strong>The Best Shoemaker Around:</strong> Has the Calamity Pool caused any trouble? It should be easy enough to tell. The weather.</p><p><strong>The Best Shoemaker Around:</strong> It&#39;s gloomy, the winds are harsh, and it&#39;s growing colder! You&#39;d think there&#39;d eventually be some rainfall, but there never is!</p><p><strong>The Best Shoemaker Around:</strong> In the beginning I was afraid that Mors would rain down, but now, as you can see, it&#39;s business as usual.</p><p><strong>The Best Shoemaker Around:</strong> No one really knows what will happen once the Calamity Pool crashes down.</p><p><strong>The Best Shoemaker Around:</strong> Not to mention getting rid of it, I&#39;ve never even thought about such a thing!</p><p><strong>The Best Shoemaker Around:</strong> Until now, Morgan&#39;s guys have been taking care of the Calamity Pool.</p><p><strong>The Best Shoemaker Around:</strong> But we can&#39;t rely on them this time. The Queen declared that she will be abandoning Norwich, damn it!</p><p><strong>The Best Shoemaker Around:</strong> ...Ah, but now that you mention it, it is weird.</p><p><strong>The Best Shoemaker Around:</strong> Until now, how did the Queen get rid of the Calamity Pool?</p><p><strong>Café Waiter with a Red Beard:</strong> A human girl adorned in a black armor?</p><p><strong>Café Waiter with a Red Beard:</strong> Yes, of course I know of her! My other customers keep talking about her!</p><p><strong>Café Waiter with a Red Beard:</strong> She&#39;s famous up north! I don&#39;t really know the details though!</p><p><strong>Café Waiter with a Red Beard:</strong> Eek! Don&#39;t come at me so fast! I just about dropped these potatoes!</p><p><strong>Café Waiter with a Red Beard:</strong> Are you not keeping a close eye on your servant&#39;s training, young lady? Ah...</p><p><strong>Café Waiter with a Red Beard:</strong> Come to think of it, at one point there was a trend like that in Salisbury!</p><p><strong>Café Waiter with a Red Beard:</strong> You would purchase a human from a farm when they were but a child, to raise them as your own!</p><p><strong>Café Waiter with a Red Beard:</strong> If you raised them well, they could grow up to be something more than farmhands! That&#39;s right~!</p><p><strong>Barbershop&#39;s Owner (Human):</strong> I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m a human, just like you. I don&#39;t know anything about the Calamity.</p><p><strong>Barbershop&#39;s Owner (Human):</strong> After all, I&#39;ve never seen one happen.</p><p><strong>Barbershop&#39;s Owner (Human):</strong> They say the Calamity strikes once every 100 years, and the Great Calamity strikes every 1,000 years, but...</p><p><strong>Barbershop&#39;s Owner (Human):</strong> The Queen&#39;s Calendar will have passed over 2,000 years this year, won&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Barbershop&#39;s Owner (Human):</strong> Everyone here is scared that a Great Calamity will strike.</p><p><strong>Barbershop&#39;s Owner (Human):</strong> My wife fell ill, and for the time being, I&#39;m in charge of this establishment.</p><p><strong>Barbershop&#39;s Owner (Human):</strong> Every day, I wake up and crush my eyes...and then, the next morning, they&#39;ve completely healed, and so I repeat crushing them over and over.</p><p><strong>Barbershop&#39;s Owner (Human):</strong> If people are so scared, why don&#39;t they flee from Norwich? Yeah...I&#39;ve asked myself that too.</p><p><strong>Barbershop&#39;s Owner (Human):</strong> But we all have our reasons for not leaving this land. I don&#39;t want to say this out loud, but—</p><p><strong>Barbershop&#39;s Owner (Human):</strong> No, nevermind. If this got out, Spriggan&#39;s soldiers would kick my door down.</p><p><strong>Barbershop&#39;s Owner (Human):</strong> I don&#39;t want to worry the missus any more than she already is. I&#39;m sorry, but I&#39;m gonna have to ask you to go somewhere else.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hmm...well, that was about what we could have expected, wasn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> So that&#39;s it for the Calamity Pool, I guess. If there was a solution, they would have already executed it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> But we did learn some things about Mash.</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yeah, it went from “people have never even heard of her” to “people have heard of her somewhere”.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I&#39;ll try to gather some more information this afternoon. To our surprise, Mash may be closer than we thought—</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> We&#39;re back! Nack&#39;s smithy was just amazing!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> “I don&#39;t know how to put this, but I wish I could do something like this,” I thought as he easily made me magecraft items~!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Yeah, he had some great ideas! He invented Fairy Kingdom-style vacuum insulation!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> The question is how light he can go...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Old man Nack had some surplus alloy steel, so hopefully he can forge it into some stainless steel.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> You two getting along with your sinister schemes? Well, at least it seems you&#39;re getting your money&#39;s worth.</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> I have returned~...Amashing...the lounge in Norwich is just amashing~</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> There&#39;s a place called a sauna...it&#39;s really hot, but so relaxing...</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> And then...I had some of the best fruit juice...</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> If I&#39;m going to stay anywhere, it has to be that inn...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Thanks for today, everyone.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> A hotel with a...spa?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> So recreational facilities are that developed here...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It seems just because they don&#39;t share the same advancement in industrial technology, the concepts remain the same as in pan-human history.</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Well, I&#39;ll spend some more time looking for a lodging place.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I didn&#39;t hear anything we haven&#39;t heard before.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> It was all just complaints about Queen Morgan and people&#39;s hopes in the Child of Prophecy.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> “When will the Child of Prophecy arrive? ”, “When they come, they will be welcomed by the entire city! ”</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> “There&#39;s no doubt they&#39;re a great-looking fairy! ” , “I&#39;ve never seen them, but I would definitely recognize them immediately! ”</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> “Stronger than even Queen Morgan, more fair than even Lancelot,”</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> “More imposing than even Gawain, more tender than Tristan without a doubt! ”</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Well, they don&#39;t have the wildest idea you&#39;re already here!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Lower your voice, Oberoooon!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Only that last one is true.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Hahaha...is that so...maybe...there was that thing with Tristan...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> But it wasn&#39;t even a competition, so I feel both happy and sad...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Don&#39;t worry, you come out on top in all of them.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> D-do you think so? Is that how you see it, Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> True, I haven&#39;t really gotten serious yet! But I&#39;ll be in big trouble if I don&#39;t have some hidden power!</p><hr><p><strong>B：Fairy by the Side:</strong> Eh...ah, woaaaaaahh! Seriously, my eyes and ears didn&#39;t deceive me!</p><p><strong>B：Fairy by the Side:</strong> Hey everyone, look! The Child of Prophecy is here!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Eh, ehh...! Wait a minute, can I have some time to prepare!?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Wrong, wrong, um, well, you&#39;re wrong, you&#39;re wrong, but...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I may not look like much, but you&#39;re right, I am the Child of Prophecy—</p><p><strong>Fairies in the Square:</strong> The knight from Sheffield who crossed the supposedly unsurmountable Vein Corridor!</p><p><strong>Fairies in the Square:</strong> She punished the despot Boggart, and has now come to help in Norwich!</p><p><strong>Fairies in the Square:</strong> The Child of Prophecy donned in black armor is here—!</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> Good evening to you, my beloved citizens of Norwich. And please, be silent.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> Normally, I would announce something like this after getting word out for all of you to gather by the bell tower, however...</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> If you all found out, there&#39;s no other choice. Let me introduce you all on this occasion.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> This knight is the hero who drove back the three Fairy Knights at Sheffield, and delivered the death penalty unto Boggart the exile.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> The Child of Prophecy, the Fairy Knight Galahad.</p><p><strong>Fairies:</strong> The Child of Prophecy! The Child of Prophecy! She has really high magical energy capacity, without a doubt!</p><p><strong>Fairies:</strong> But Spriggan, why is the Child of Prophecy here with you?</p><p><strong>Fairies:</strong> The Child of Prophecy is an adversary to Her Majesty Morgan, no?</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> It is merely a misunderstanding. Her Majesty has never ordered such a thing as killing the Child of Prophecy.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> “Once located, politely take them into your custody, and invite them to Camelot. ”</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> That is the order the clan chiefs have been given by Her Majesty, Queen Morgan.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> So in accordance with that request, I personally went to receive Galahad, who had come through Odovena.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> We couldn&#39;t disregard the risk of something happening along the way, and so she was escorted here by my elite guard.</p><p><strong>A：Fairies:</strong> So that&#39;s how it is...the Child of Prophecy will soon be brought to Camelot...</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> No, no!</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> Her Majesty Morgan never ordered such a thing to occur “immediately”!</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> I am Spriggan, chosen by your vote as head of the Earth Clan!</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> My loyalty to Her Majesty Morgan is without doubt, but above all else, I prioritize the safety of everyone in Norwich.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> As such...for the time being, Lord Galahad will stay in my Vault Fortress.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> The Child of Prophecy has arrived in Norwich! The Calamity is no longer to be feared!</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> Citizens, please find peace in keeping your businesses open!</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> Let me, Spriggan, shoulder the responsibility of the Queen&#39;s scolding!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> The c-c-child of prophecy...huh? Huuuuh?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Could it be that I have perhaps been incredibly embarrassingly mistaken? Ahahaha...</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> That cannot be right. Please have faith in yourself, Artoria!</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> I don&#39;t know who this Galahad is, but surely she&#39;s either a sham or the real deal!</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> Right? Isn&#39;t that right, Fujimaru? You&#39;ve been with Artoria all this time and...</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> Why do you have an expression as if time stopped? If you betray us, I&#39;ll stab you, just so you know.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Because—because...</p><hr><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> Because?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s Mash—!</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> What—!?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> —</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Ah, you can&#39;t! Calm down! You can&#39;t rush into the square right now...!</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> Oh? I am in the middle of my speech, and you have strolled right through the crowd, up onto my stage.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> You are not from Norwich, are you?</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> If you were, you would be aware of the consequences of such a thing—</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> Hold it. Stand down. He&#39;s only human, hardly dangerous.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> Your features, they are Japanese, right? Then, you are the one of whom Beryl spoke...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Out of my way, I have no business with you!</p><hr><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> If you have not come to see me, whom is it you have come to see?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s obvious—it&#39;s you, Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Galahad:</strong> Mash...uhm, how did you know that name? You and I have never met, yet...</p><p><strong>Galahad:</strong> Ah...I see, it&#39;s what I called myself in Sheffield, so it must have spread from there.</p><p><strong>Galahad:</strong> Yes. I am Mash, Knight of Sheffield. I am also known as the Child of Prophecy.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Eh—?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (Don&#39;t tell me...Mash doesn&#39;t remember either...? )</p><hr><p><strong>Galahad:</strong> Just as Spriggan said, I have come to repel the Calamity from Norwich.</p><p><strong>Galahad:</strong> Though I cannot promise I will definitely be able to do so...</p><p><strong>Galahad:</strong> I hereby vow to fight until the very end with all my power. I would be blessed should you wish to lend me your power.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> —</p><hr><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> That&#39;s our Child of Prophecy. What a wonderful announcement. These citizens will be able to rest soundly through the night.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> Enough talk. Guards, get this [♂ boy /♀ girl] away from me.</p><p><strong>Spriggan&#39;s Guard:</strong> Sir! Hey you, let&#39;s go! You should be glad you don&#39;t get a beating!</p><p><strong>Galahad:</strong> Ah...pardon me, could I have a few more moments with that—</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> I am sorry, but we should return to the castle before long. Lord Galahad, this way, if you would.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> I have arranged a special carriage for you, fit for the Child of Prophecy...oh?</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> Is all well with you? Your tears are falling.</p><p><strong>Galahad:</strong> Eh—huh, I am—why am I—</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> You must have gotten some of Norwich&#39;s soot in your eyes. That&#39;s how it is in this town.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> Please rest for now, Child of Prophecy. My castle is the most secure location in all the Fairy Kingdom.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> ...Guards. Keep an eye on the human for now. Should [♂ he /♀ she] go someplace outside of public favor, you may arrest [♂ him /♀ her].</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> I don&#39;t care if they feel it a little. As long as you don&#39;t kill them.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> They are another of Her Majesty&#39;s visitors. In times to come, they will be useful as a bargaining chip.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Phew, that was tense. I never thought we&#39;d square off against Spriggan.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> That guy was Spriggan, head of the Earth Clan. He&#39;s also the lord of Norwich.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> And that girl he had with him. The one they called Child of Prophecy...</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> That was Mash, wasn&#39;t it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (Nodding)</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yes, I&#39;m certain. I could only see her from a distance, but that was definitely Mash.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...I don&#39;t know why she claims to be the Child of Prophecy, or why she didn&#39;t recognize Fujimaru...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> No, it&#39;s a familiar case. The Nameless Forest.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I have a special memory capacity configured, compared to everyone else, so I could mitigate loss of myself, but...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Just like Fujimaru and Artoria,</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> it&#39;s very likely that she is experiencing temporary amnesia.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> ...However, Fujimaru&#39;s memories came back rather quickly, didn&#39;t they?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> So why hasn&#39;t the shield girl gotten hers back yet?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hmm...before remembering her true self, maybe she acquired a very strong “role”...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Perhaps? Whatever the case, we&#39;ll have to speak to Mash to find out what her condition is...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Still, she was safe.</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> That&#39;s right. You were right all along, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I was quite surprised when I heard her being called the Child of Prophecy,</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> but other than that, this is good. Now we know that she is staying here in Norwich.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Yeah. Spriggan may have beaten us to her, but the very least, it appears she&#39;ll be treated as a guest of honor.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> We can try to create a situation where we&#39;re able to speak to Mash at some point. It&#39;s all just a matter of time.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> On the other hand, a more immediate issue—</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> I got it. That group there, right?</p><p><strong>L：Spriggan&#39;s Guard:</strong> You, human, and your crew. You are all under suspicion of criminal activity.</p><p><strong>L：Spriggan&#39;s Guard:</strong> Please come peacefully. If you resist, you will be punished here and now as guilty criminals.</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> Spriggan&#39;s soldiers...! What are we gonna do, guys!?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> We&#39;ll beat them up, of course! Right, Fujimaru!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yeah, let&#39;s break through!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Our goal is just to retreat! Let&#39;s go!</p><hr><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Tch, a second group. Form up around Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Don&#39;t spread out too much, they&#39;ll pick us off one by one if we&#39;re separated!</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> Y-yes! You&#39;re right, they&#39;re much stronger than me...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yeah, they might not be on the same level as the soldiers from Olympus, but these soldiers are way too good! They&#39;re fairies!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> (Let&#39;s see, in a case like this I need flash magecraft, flash magecraft...ah, I used it up at Nack&#39;s place! )</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Even more troops...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;ve got your back...!</p><hr><p><strong>Spriggan&#39;s Guard:</strong> Good, the military police must&#39;ve heard the commotion and come over. You guys, block off that alleyway!</p><p><strong>Spriggan&#39;s Guard:</strong> This is the end for your shady troupe! Lord Spriggan shall judge—what!?</p><p><strong>Norwich Military Police:</strong> It is you for whom this is over. This place is under the jurisdiction of us, the Norwich Business Association.</p><p><strong>Norwich Military Police:</strong> The City Lord&#39;s private army has no right to arrest here. You are the ones committing a crime here.</p><p><strong>Spriggan&#39;s Guard:</strong> What the hell is wrong with you? You&#39;re no more than humans...! What even is a Business soldier!?</p><p><strong>Norwich Military Police:</strong> We are a temporary security force acknowledged by the Business Association as a countermeasure against the Calamity Pool.</p><p><strong>Norwich Military Police:</strong> Our financier is the “Count”—do I need to answer any other questions?</p><p><strong>Spriggan&#39;s Guard:</strong> You&#39;re backed by the Count...!? No, we won&#39;t cause any trouble...!</p><p><strong>Spriggan&#39;s Guard:</strong> Guh...forget about it, let&#39;s go...! I&#39;ll remember that face of yours, Mr. Military Policeman!</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> They retreated quietly along with their wounded...but...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Oh, you guys are also soldiers of Norwich, I can tell. Why are you helping us?</p><p><strong>Norwich Military Police:</strong> We do not know the specifics either. However, those two...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Me?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> And me?</p><p><strong>Norwich Military Police:</strong> Yes. The Count has asked me to extend an invitation to you both to his mansion as his guests.</p><p><strong>Norwich Military Police:</strong> As his guests, you are important visitors as far as we are concerned.</p><p><strong>Norwich Military Police:</strong> If you can spare the time, please make your way over to the Count&#39;s mansion.</p><p><strong>Norwich Military Police:</strong> And let me welcome you all warmly as the true saviors of Norwich—</p><p><strong>Norwich Military Police:</strong> Indeed, Count Peperon has relayed those words.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Count Peperon—?</p><hr><p>Note! Scene Change</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> Of cooouuurse it&#39;s me! Long time no see, my deeaaar Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Artoria &amp; Gareth:</strong> Watch out, a Fairy Deadlord—!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Wait, wait, wait.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I know what you&#39;re thinking, but put your weapons away!</p><hr><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> What&#39;s this~♡ I haven&#39;t seen you in so long, and suddenly you have two new cute girls with you!</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> Lady luck smiles on you! I guess you&#39;re not only popular with Mash, but also with the local girls!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Ah...Is that really Peperoncino? How flashy, I hardly recognized you...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> No, it&#39;s not that I didn&#39;t recognize you. You&#39;re no longer merely a hungry raven. You&#39;re something more menacing, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Oh, Muramasa knows him too? We&#39;ve never met before. I would appreciate if someone introduced us.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> Oh my! (Who&#39;s this handsome man next to Muramasa!? )</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> —Ahem. I am so sorry, I haven&#39;t introduced myself.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> I am Count Peperon. An extraordinarily charismatic designer who flew in like a comet.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> With my can-do spirit, I launched a brand which rivaled the Knocker Company in just a month.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> Don&#39;t you worry too much about our past, okay Muramasa? Also...</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Hello, Count Peperon. So this is you. It&#39;s an honor to meet you.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I am Oberon. Servant of pan-human history, Fairy King Oberon.</p><p><strong>R：Count Peperon:</strong> My! Oberon, THAT Oberon!? From “A Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream”!?</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> How wonderful, you&#39;re just like I imagined! You and I will get along splendidly!</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> Our names are similar after all! Peperon and Oberon, it must be a sign of talent~!</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> ...Fujimaru. Do you really know this guy?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I don&#39;t think he&#39;s human in many senses of the word...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Pepe is a splendid person.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I have my doubts, but Pepe is human.</p><hr><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> Fufu. With support like that, I can&#39;t help but feel calmer already.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> Now then, shall we talk properly?</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> Why am I in the Fairy Kingdom? How did I acquire such a magnificent mansion?</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> I bet there&#39;s so much on your mind that you can hardly breathe, right?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> No, we get it.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You followed Beryl here on your own in order to avenge Kirschtaria, didn&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> While we were taking care of Limbo, you had a month&#39;s or so headstart on us.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> And so, with your knowledge of pan-human history, you were unmatched in the Fairy Kingdom, and reigned under the guise of a charismatic designer.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Though maybe you got a bit carried away when you started calling yourself Count Peperon...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That&#39;s what I think. What about you, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Agree completely.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (Da Vinci seems like she&#39;s seriously about to burst...! )</p><hr><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> Thank you for the explanation! You really saved me there, da Vinci!</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> But I&#39;m surprised how quick you were to point out Beryl. Do I seem like that much of an affectionate companion to you?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Eh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Eh?</p><hr><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> ...You can tell, right? How I&#39;m both happy and sad.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> When people put that kind of faith in you, it&#39;s difficult to keep acting as a Crypter.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Oh. You&#39;re still acting as a Crypter, then?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Kirschtaria came at odds with the Alien God. Rather, they were enemies from the onset.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You, who leaned so strongly on Kirschtaria...we assumed you were a Crypter no longer after Olympus...</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> I can&#39;t get off that easily. Daybit is still around, as well.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> But this isn&#39;t about that. This isn&#39;t for Wodime&#39;s sake.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> This is a matter of personal integrity.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> As a member of the A-team, I have to clean up our own mess, you know?</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> Tell me, how was your fight against Wodime, Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> Was it fun? Or perhaps bothersome?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It was both.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Kirschtaria was an amazing Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> Right—</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> Well, let&#39;s talk some more about it.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> And please, could you tell me as much as you can about the state of affairs in Chaldea?</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> I see...a crisis of the earth, separate from that of the Bleaching.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> So, Fujimaru came to the Fairy Kingdom in order to prevent this “collapse” from happening.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> You&#39;ve convinced me. It&#39;s definitely a problem we cannot ignore.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> But what went down after you arrived here is an issue. The reason why Mash isn&#39;t here.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Fujimaru, Mash, and I all took different paths through the Nameless Forest.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Somehow, Mash ended up going north, and was treated as the Child of Prophecy by the fairies there.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Do you know anything about how that happened, Count Peperon?</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> No, I don&#39;t. I have only heard that Mash is called the Child of Prophecy.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> But...she most definitely is not. She&#39;s not even a fairy.</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> That&#39;s right. The Child of Prophecy is definitely Artoria!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Noo~~...Gareth, you don&#39;t have to be so assertive of that...do you?</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> No, I am certain you are the Child of Prophecy. You are with Fujimaru, after all.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> I&#39;ve heard Ainsel&#39;s prophecy too. A staff of selection, and a foreign traveler to act as a guide.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> Those two things you definitely have. I&#39;m certain Artoria is the savior of this world.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> Not only does it match the contents of the prophecy, but the very color of your soul tells me as much.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> Have faith, Artoria. You are much more tenacious than you might believe.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Huh—ah, yes. Thank you, Count Peperon.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> But, is this really okay?</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> Speaking so lightly of pan-human history around Artoria and Gareth.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> Have Chaldea&#39;s security measures really become so lax?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...It&#39;s as you say, and I&#39;m sure Gordolf is going to lecture me about it later...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But our Master requested that we at least disclose our goal here.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> My, how honest. But won&#39;t they grow suspicious?</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> If you speak openly about pan-human history in the Fairy Kingdom, people might come to question your sanity.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> No need to worry about that. We don&#39;t understand a single word of what they&#39;ve told us anyway!</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> What she said!</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> However, we do know that Fujimaru is working very hard, so it&#39;ll be alright!</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> You have such wonderful companions, don&#39;t you? I really do envy the fortune bestowed on you.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> There may be people stronger than you, smarter than you, or what-have-you.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> But to be “blessed with people who care for you” is only afforded to those who live their life like that.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> It isn&#39;t allowed for someone like me who lived their life doing as they pleased! Only those alike yourself will join you, right?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That&#39;s not right, Count. Those soldiers from before, they trust in you.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That&#39;s not the kind of trust that money can buy. You&#39;re not as bad a person as you might think you are.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> Really? Well, if you say so.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Count, may I ask you something?</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> What would that be? I wouldn&#39;t turn down a question from a prince, now would I?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I want to know what the deal is with Norwich and Spriggan.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Why haven&#39;t the fairies of Norwich evacuated?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> What is Spriggan planning to do when the Calamity strikes?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Those two things are what I&#39;m asking of you.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> There&#39;s a simple answer, Oberon.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> The fairies of Norwich haven&#39;t been evacuated because they don&#39;t fear death in the sense that we do...</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> However, the biggest contributors are “work” and “land”.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> Fairies value their “purpose” above all else, right?</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> For the fairies of Norwich, “purpose” amounts to “work” itself.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> They can&#39;t abandon their “work” so easily, and so they are mentally shackled.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> In addition, before the dark cloud appeared in the sky, Spriggan put Norwich&#39;s land up for sale.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> In the past, Spriggan stole the land from the previous lord.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> The former lord, and all the fairies who had owned the land, were exiled to the north.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> After that, Spriggan owned all the land by himself.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> Until now, the blacksmiths in Norwich had simply been renting the land to conduct business here.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> But now it was finally up for sale, so the fairies all bought their own piece of “land”.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> Until now, those fairies had been exploited by Spriggan,</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> but now, after paying with everything they had, they finally owned their “own land”.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> The tension in Norwich had lifted, but shortly afterwards—</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The Calamity Pool appeared in the sky above Norwich...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The reason the fairies won&#39;t leave Norwich is because they now own their own plot of “land”.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> For a blacksmith, his workshop is more important than even his life.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Which means, no matter how scared they are of some “Calamity Pool”, they can&#39;t leave this place.</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> Is that why you organized those soldiers? You were worried about Spriggan&#39;s soldiers acting alone.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> No. Spriggan&#39;s soldiers have no intention of protecting Norwich in the first place.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> They&#39;d rather let the Calamity come.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> I assume that they would rather all the fairies and buildings in town simply disappear.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Why, though?</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> Well, you know...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Right...then the contract is annulled, I guess.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Ah, I understand. It&#39;s land sharking, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> Right. As expected of you, Muramasa, you&#39;re accustomed to this kind of talk.</p><hr><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> Spriggan never had any intention of giving up his land. He simply knew the Calamity was coming.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> Well, it&#39;s just as the prophecy says, “Calamity will come to a city of iron and soot”.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> As such, he initially sold off the land to the fairies at extortionate prices.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> Afterwards, when the Calamity in Norwich has been dealt with, he would reclaim the rights to the land.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> The inheritance tax in Norwich is very high. It&#39;s not something the “next generation of fairies” could afford.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> With minimal effort, Spriggan was able to pocket the profit of selling the land.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> And later, he will have the opportunity to redevelop Norwich as he sees fit.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> He struck two birds with one stone. You&#39;d think such a crooked fairy could only exist in pan-human history, wouldn&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Even compared to pan-human history, he&#39;s a villain! Spriggan, how can you be so shameless...!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> So the fairies of Norwich just “continue their daily lives”...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> No, it&#39;s as if they have to. Because if they leave...</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> They would be penniless...and as it stands now, in the Fairy Kingdom, that means being unable to pay next year&#39;s “existence tax”.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> It&#39;s improper.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> There are still fairies in Norwich who care for their human servants...</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> But when the Calamity strikes, the humans will die.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Even though the fairies sympathetic to humans want to escape Norwich, they cannot find the resolve to do so.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hold on. Spriggan doesn&#39;t have any intention of protecting Norwich, you said?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Then, him taking in Mash before means...!</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Yeah, though there&#39;s no need to worry about her. When I saw her earlier, she exuded the magical energy capacity of a Fairy Knight.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Spriggan wouldn&#39;t be able to take her on. His best bet would be to distract her in his castle to keep her away for long enough.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> The issue is...that means there&#39;s no way for us to meet with Mash anymore.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Ah, you&#39;re right...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Spriggan wants to save his own hide, so there is no way he would let the Child of Prophecy outside...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> If she started talking to the citizens or the like, she would immediately catch wind about his plans...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...We won&#39;t be able to meet with Mash?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...So we have to sneak into Spriggan&#39;s castle?</p><hr><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> I would recommend against doing such a thing. Spriggan&#39;s castle is the most well-guarded castle in all the Fairy Kingdom.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> It&#39;s like Spriggan&#39;s personality—“no one can get it”, “no one is allowed to disturb”—given form.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> It&#39;s also known as his Vault Fortress. Even a Fairy Knight would find it difficult to break in there.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> In hindsight, it might have been a mistake to let Mash be taken by Spriggan in the first place...</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> If you want to see Mash, she will have to come out of the castle.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> Alrighty, that concludes the battle~☆ You lovelies really showed me what you&#39;re capable of~!</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> Ooh...those were Norwich&#39;s specialty, golems, “treasures that come alive with use of fairy dust”!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Good job, everyone~☆</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Why were we suddenly brought to this mountain side, I don&#39;t get it...</p><hr><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> We were in the middle of a conversation when he interrupted, saying “how about some exercise? ” and I was taken aback...</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> But the fight turned out to be a cakewalk! I do appreciate being able to take the backseat!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Count, can I grab this thing as my reward?</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> Of course. Anything for the Child of Prophecy. They deserve to live a rich life after all, don&#39;t they?</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> Right you are! Thank you so much, Count!</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> Artoria, Fujimaru! Let&#39;s go to the shops when we get back to Norwich!</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> There&#39;s some wakame-flavored ice cream, and they say it&#39;s just so delicious!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (Wakame-flavored...is this Tokushima? )</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (Well...a seaside town would have that...)</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Hmm, I think I&#39;ll wait and see! Gramps...I mean, Muramasa said he&#39;d taste it first!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Haa, wakame-flavored sweets? You want me to eat seaweed sprinkled with sugar?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> ...Well, can&#39;t knock it til I try it, can I? Can&#39;t you just let me have normal ice cream, though...?</p><p>Note! Scene Change</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hmhm, that was a great way to ease the tension everyone was feeling about the situation in Norwich.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Combining a distraction and a test of our mettle into one and the same? You&#39;re cunning, Count.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> It was simply a chore that had to be taken care of. I had been asked to get rid of the golems in the area.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> Don&#39;t put too much faith in me, okay, da Vinci?</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> As I said, I&#39;m still a Crypter. Once Beryl has been dealt with, I will return to being your adversary.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...Crypter. Myourenji Arou, that was your birthname, right?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> According to Chaldea&#39;s records, you were handling dirty work for the Mage&#39;s Association at the time you were recruited by Marisbilly,</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> and after joining the Astromancy department, you finally ended up at Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...That&#39;s as much as you told us in India. However, there are no records of what you did before all that.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You helped us out in both India and at Olympus. And now we&#39;re to cooperate here in Britain as well.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I&#39;d say it&#39;s not too much of me to ask for a fellow companion to share his backstory, is it?</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> My! What a line, it struck right at my heart! You really are a universal genius! What a perfect pick-up line!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Wow, I&#39;ve never attempted pick-ups before, but I guess that WAS a perfect pick-up line just now.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> Yes, a fantastic one, I must say.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> Because you didn&#39;t say that for the sake of Chaldea, but for my own sake.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> Then, what kind of man would I be if I did not give an answer. —It&#39;s not a very exciting story, shall I tell it anyway?</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> Myourenji Arou. What happened during the time when I still carried that name?</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> What sort of person was I?</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> Well, since you knew about my dirty work for the Clock Tower, you likely have some idea already.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> My family was one of Shugendou practitioners. More specifically—of tengu techniques.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> A school of Shugendou with the premise of arriving at hell by corrupting into a tengu.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> I seemed to be exceptionally talented, and was praised for it, but...</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> I only wanted to be myself, you know? Ultimately, that ended up getting me excommunicated.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> After that, I no longer had any business with my family, and so I—settled things, and left Japan.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Settled things, what does that mean?</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> I massacred my family and their disciples.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...That&#39;s why no one knows about your past...and why there aren&#39;t any records of it, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Just in case, I&#39;ll ask you, why?</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> ...I don&#39;t really have an answer, just that I thought they were bad.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> For one generation, the Myourenji were a family of Houjutsu practitioners.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> When the founder fell to the world of the tengu, he connected a path to the Maouson on the mountain, but...</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> The issue was, that path was only for the “founder”. As such, his descendants faced some trouble.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> Long training were forced on us in order to superhumanize our bodies without the help of the Maouson.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> In terms of magi, well...it&#39;s probably more accurate to say we were like Muramasa.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> Through rigorous work they would create a special “body”—special “circuits”—that would only be around for a single generation, as they died without passing it on to their descendants.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> That wasn&#39;t my issue, though. My issue was how the family was set up.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> I&#39;m a direct descendant of the “founder”, so I was born and raised on the mountain, but...</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> The other children in the Myourenji family were kidnapped from the world below the mountain, you see?</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> Back in the days, when the mortality rate of childbirth was higher, kidnapping children to raise them and act as their foster parent...</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> Such a thing might have been fine, but—</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> If they couldn&#39;t keep up with the training, you&#39;d be thrown down the mountain. Even if you endured the training, you were only bound to descend into hell.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> There is nothing to gain from meddling in other people&#39;s fate, only to corrupt them into tengu.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> There was nothing to be gained for those people. That is why I killed every single one of them as I climbed down the mountain.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Even though they were your family?</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> Because they were my family. If they were mere strangers, I would have been able to ignore them.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> But because we were family, related by blood, I had to assume full responsibility, wouldn&#39;t you say?</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> I might be a man of compassion, but my fastidiousness takes priority. In the end, a clean slate took priority over even my feelings for my relatives.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> Just as I am now a brute who prioritizes settling the score over my sentiment as Crypter.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> I&#39;m convinced this is the reason I have cooperated with you all these times.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> Do you understand now?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Indeed. You&#39;ve displayed strength far beyond what I imagined.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Although, I am curious about something. When you said you were talented, what extent are we talking about?</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> Let&#39;s see...</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> The Shugendou practitioners of the Myourenji family would acquire an abhijñā after 100 years of training...</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> If you were able to acquire even one of the six abhijñā, you would qualify as a tengu...</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> By the age of 10, I had acquired three of them.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> Shinsokutsuu, to run long distances; Tashintsuu, to read others&#39; minds.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> And then...Roshintsuu, awareness of one&#39;s own lifespan and destiny.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> That&#39;s the kind of stuff you&#39;d expect from the family&#39;s greatest genius!</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> Dear me, I&#39;m SUCH a luxury! I&#39;ve been a deceitful man since I was born!</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> But about this, don&#39;t go telling anyone!</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> I hope this can stay between just me and you, da Vinci!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Thank goodness Count Peperon is such a gourmand~!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It&#39;s been 26 days since we arrived in the Fairy Kingdom, and during all that time we haven&#39;t had a full course meal!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> A mix of Italian and Japanese cuisine.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yeah, Artoria and Gareth seemed apprehensive about eating at first, but they devoured it in the end.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Oberon was out of his seat, though. Now that I think about it, it&#39;s rare to see him eat.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Huh...? Hasn&#39;t it only been 16 days?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Ah, I knew there would be a discrepancy there.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I&#39;ve suspected it since Salisbury, but now is as good a time as any to explain it.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Most likely, the time you have spent in the Fairy Kingdom is 10 days more than what you think.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You told me you were in the fairy village in the Nameless Forest, but it had already been 10 days before you woke up there.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> About 10 days after I started working for Mike is when you guys finally showed up.</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Anyway, it&#39;s getting late. We&#39;ll have a lot to think about tomorrow, so I think it&#39;s best we rest now.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> One party will scout out Spriggan&#39;s Vault Fortress, while another investigates the Calamity Pool in the sky.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> We can split up first thing in the morning, and afterwards we&#39;ll know what we need to plan for.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Well then, good night, Fujimaru. The Count prepared private rooms for us.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> So take it easy tonight, okay?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Oh.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Oberon.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Good evening, Fujimaru. I was just heading out for a bit.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> More reconnaissance, dressed like that?</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Unlike the rest of you, I can&#39;t fight. I have to at least do some scouting for you.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> You&#39;re heading to bed, are you? We&#39;ve been out on the plains for a long time now, so it must be nice sleeping in a proper bed again.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Not only did Artoria reach Norwich, but Mash appeared as another Child of Prophecy.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> In this case, there&#39;s no way Morgan won&#39;t act. I&#39;ll have to keep a careful eye on Camelot for now.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> No sweat, I&#39;ll be back by sunrise. Well then—</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> ...No.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> ...Excuse my curtness, but are you alright?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...What?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...Do I seem overworked?</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Yeah. When we were talking about Spriggan and Mash earlier, I thought you were gonna get up and storm the Vault Fortress then and there.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> But you kept quiet. You didn&#39;t change your priorities.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> All you wanted was to see Mash, but your responsibility as Master of Chaldea held you back.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> It was a smart decision, but I could tell it bothered you. I could see it on your face.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Worry and trust are different, aren&#39;t they?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You&#39;re the one who taught me that, Oberon.</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Hmm, well, I did say that, but...</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> ...I just didn&#39;t expect you to meet her so soon...I shouldn&#39;t have said those things...</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> No, it was nothing. I just had something I need to tell you.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> ...You said Mash hadn&#39;t recovered her memories yet, that she had forgotten her name in the Nameless Forest.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Da Vinci&#39;s hypothesis was correct. If someone loses their name in that forest,</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> and before recovering their memories, acquires a more powerful role than their former self—</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Having acquired a “new self”, sometimes, it might not be possible to go back to their “old self”.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I don&#39;t know how she got caught up in the whole “Child of Prophecy” thing,</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> but do you believe that the girl you knew as Mash once held a greater role than that of the Child of Prophecy?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> A herculean burden of shouldering the hopes of countless people. The indescribable torment of being responsible for the fate of an entire world.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> ...Yeah, I&#39;m sorry, but I cannot imagine anything greater than that. The Mash you sought is gone.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> But to expose the riddle of the Fairy Kingdom, we only have need of one Child of Prophecy. And we already have Artoria.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> So—is there a need for you to care?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> If Mash will never remember you? If she will never return to being the girl you once knew?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> —</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> ...of course there is. I can see it on your face.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> It was a dumb question. I&#39;m sorry I wasted your time.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> If this is what you&#39;ve decided, I&#39;ll do what I can. Leave it to me to figure out the state of this world!</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Let&#39;s go, Vesper! Speedstar, prepare for take-off!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> HEY, GOOD MORNING! Did you all have a good night&#39;s sleep?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> All thanks to you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It even beats the Ritz.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> Doesn&#39;t it, doesn&#39;t it? You can simply get lost in the exquisite upholstery and the bedding, can&#39;t you!</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> But when you say Ritz, which Ritz do you mean, I wonder—! There&#39;s so much going on, little me can&#39;t keep up—!</p><hr><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> In any case, we should have a serious talk before breakfast.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> I want to consult with you about Norwich&#39;s security, but...</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> Oberon, you go first. You have something to share with everyone, don&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Thank you for the thought, Count. I&#39;ll share a few words, then.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Last night, I scouted the area around Norwich, as well as the circumstances at Camelot.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> As for the rain clouds over Norwich...the Calamity Pool, it&#39;s gaining momentum.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> The rotational velocity of the vortex is increasing, that is. I hadn&#39;t noticed until now, but it&#39;s giving off a tremendous amount of magical energy.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> If we likened it to pure fuel, it would be enough to burn all of Norwich to the ground.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I have confirmed the same.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yesterday, it was nothing more than rain clouds. But this morning, I was able to measure an amount of magical energy comparable to a super-sized nuclear reactor core.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> A super-sized nuclear reactor core. Huh, what would that be like? The Machine Gods of Olympus?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Not on the level of a Machine God, but...in Chaldea terms, it would be the equivalent of two months of electricity used.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> An amount on the scale of Singularity Restoration Rayshifting...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (Does that amount include the upkeep for Servants...? )</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Hmm, Chaldea really is an amazing place, isn&#39;t it? To be able to consume that much magical energy in such a short time, you know?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Anyway, the situation in Norwich has degraded compared to yesterday. The citizens were on edge this morning.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> As for Camelot, fortunately, there has been no signs of movement as of yet.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> No sign of an army leaving the castle. At most, about 20 soldiers have gone out to deal with Mors.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> One more thing...let&#39;s see, right, Morgan has apparently sent everyone away and shut herself in her throne room since last night.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> So then, Spriggan hasn&#39;t told Her Majesty about Mash...I mean, the Child of Prophecy?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> That&#39;s a safe bet. In part due to Spriggan&#39;s own greed, I&#39;d assume.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> He wants the Calamity to occur, but he also wants his Vault Fortress to remain safe at all costs.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> That&#39;s where he keeps all the treasure he collects, after all.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> He claims that it won&#39;t be destroyed by the Calamity, but it seems he still wants some insurance.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> In the worst case, he&#39;ll let Mash...the Child of Prophecy, protect his castle.</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> That&#39;s not really my idea of a great clan head.</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> Once, I would have thought he needed to suffer some and reflect on his actions...at least, that&#39;s what I would have thought.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I fully agree. As such, let&#39;s make protecting Norwich our top priority for now.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> The city of Norwich remaining safe—that will deal the biggest blow to Spriggan.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> After all, it&#39;s not difficult to imagine what will happen to a disliked lord who can&#39;t get his valued land back once the new year comes, is it?</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> Ah! I get it!</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> That&#39;s all I had to share. I&#39;m sorry I couldn&#39;t figure out more.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Don&#39;t say that. The information about the Queen&#39;s army not having moved yet is valuable enough on its own.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> We&#39;ll be able to focus on the issues at hand in Norwich. First, we&#39;ll investigate the rain clouds in the sky—</p><p><strong>Norwich Military Police:</strong> There&#39;s an emergency, Count Peperon!</p><p><strong>Norwich Military Police:</strong> A massive number of Mors have emerged from the sea, and are moving into the residential district!</p><p><strong>Norwich Military Police:</strong> More than a thousand of them! —The Calamity, it has begun!</p><p><strong>Norwich Military Police:</strong> Those who own houses, remain indoors! If you go outside, the Mors will kill you!</p><p><strong>Norwich Military Police:</strong> Those with no homes, evacuate to the shelter, hurry now!</p><p><strong>Norwich Military Police:</strong> Shit, more of them...! Where the hell are these things—</p><p><strong>Fairy Opening Shop:</strong> Whaaaaaa! Don&#39;t come near, don&#39;t come near!</p><p><strong>Mors:</strong> [[File: Npc_language_1. png200px]]</p><p><strong>Mors:</strong> [[File: Npc_language_1. png200px]]</p><p><strong>Fairy Opening Shop:</strong> Heeeee! They&#39;re everywhere, everywhere! Help me, help meeee!</p><p><strong>Fairy Opening Shop:</strong> I&#39;m scared, I&#39;m scared, I&#39;m scared—! Forgive me, forgive me, forgive me, forgive me...!</p><p><strong>Fairy Opening Shop:</strong> What the hell is this, it hurts, it hurts, it huuuuuuurts! Aa, aaaa, aaaaaa.... !</p><p><strong>Norwich Military Police:</strong> What the hell was that just now? The Mors devoured that fairy whole and grew in size...!?</p><p><strong>Norwich Military Police:</strong> I&#39;ve never heard of such a thing happening...No, this time it&#39;s the Calamity...</p><p><strong>Norwich Military Police:</strong> Alright, report to the Count! “We cannot hold our position. We must withdraw! ”</p><p><strong>Norwich Military Police:</strong> “The hostile Mors are growing as they feed on fairies! Human soldiers will face huge issues trying to take them on! ”</p><p><strong>Norwich Military Police:</strong> Quickly now, at this rate the northern district will fall in no time! Focus on evacuating the residents of the southern ward only!</p><p><strong>Norwich Military Police:</strong> That was all the squad leader had to report! Please provide evacuation advisory to leave the city, Count!</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> Hm, I thought we&#39;d have more time, but this is just the way the cookie crumbles, I guess.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> Seeeeeriously, the more unpleasant things happen at an unpleasant timing, the more it all becomes unpleasant.</p><p><strong>O：Norwich Military Police:</strong> My...Count?</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> Calm yourself, I haven&#39;t lost my mind. —What will you do if I give order to evacuate the city?</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> Spriggan&#39;s soldiers have most likely closed the gates by this point. They want the fairies to succumb, after all.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> Escort the citizens to the evacuation shelters we prepared. Have the military police withdraw to the shelter as well.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> You, the human soldiers, will protect the citizens and hold the Mors off at the port.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> Your priority should be to safeguard the people. Do not make the mistake of thinking you can fight the Mors.</p><p><strong>O：Norwich Military Police:</strong> But, if we don&#39;t deal with the Mors, the shelter will fall—</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> You&#39;re right. But that&#39;s why they are here. Isn&#39;t that so, Child of Prophecy and company?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yeah, leave it to us!</p><hr><p><strong>O：Norwich Military Police:</strong> Ah! So that one is the Child of Prophecy!</p><p><strong>O：Norwich Military Police:</strong> Rather ordinary, but she seems good to me!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Ah...ahaha, yeah. I appreciate your honesty, thank you.</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> W-wait a minute, this...I don&#39;t know about this.</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> We&#39;re going up against Mors. Fairies don&#39;t stand a chance.</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> ...I cannot even imagine what it would take for us to win. I think we have to retreat here and wait for things to...</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Hey. That&#39;s not something the courageous Gareth would say.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> The Mors may be the natural enemy of fairies, but that doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t fight.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Artoria can backup Muramasa and da Vinci from the backlines.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> We also have Fujimaru&#39;s summoning technique. We&#39;ll be able to drive off at least some of the Mors.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> What do you say, Artoria? You came here to save Norwich.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Whatever the Calamity is, it&#39;s something you need to confront in order for your story to begin.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> O-of course! Leave it to me!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> And don&#39;t worry about the Mors! My body won&#39;t corrupt even if I come into contact with them!</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> Is that so!? In that case—yeah, we can do it!</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> It&#39;s decided, then. You will hold off the Mors on the street in the southern district.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> I will need to remain in command here, so I cannot accompany you.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> Hold them off for one hour, and that should be enough time to evacuate the entire southern district.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Roger that!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Let&#39;s go, Artoria!</p><hr><p>Note! Scene Change</p><p><strong>Shoemaker Fairy, Hiding under a Shelf:</strong> Waa...waaa...</p><p><strong>Shoemaker Fairy, Hiding under a Shelf:</strong> I shouldn&#39;t have come to check on the shop...shouldn&#39;t have come to check on the plantation with all this rain pouring...</p><p><strong>Shoemaker Fairy, Hiding under a Shelf:</strong> Completely surrounded...they&#39;re gonna find me, unless...</p><p><strong>Shoemaker Fairy, Hiding under a Shelf:</strong> Help me...help me...help me...Lady Savior...Lady Tonelico...</p><p><strong>Shoemaker Fairy, Hiding under a Shelf:</strong> The fairies of my previous generation, and the one before that, and the one before that all spent their time making worthless shoes in Norwich...</p><p><strong>Shoemaker Fairy, Hiding under a Shelf:</strong> They even made shoes for Lady Tonelico, or at least that&#39;s how legend has it...</p><p><strong>Shoemaker Fairy, Hiding under a Shelf:</strong> So please save me...spare me...spare me...ah, why do the Mors seem frightened...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> There, a shoemaker fairy!</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Stay where you are! We&#39;ll take care of the Mors!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Now or never! Quickly, get to the Count&#39;s shelter!</p><p><strong>Shoemaker Fairy:</strong> You s-s-saved me! Thank you, girl with the staff!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Gareth, you have good vision, right? Can you see what the harbor&#39;s like!?</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> Eh...!?</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> Y-yes, I see it! A swarm of Mors are coming from the harbor!</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> 30...60...more than 100! Ah, they split up! Half of them are going elsewhere!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Towards the northern district!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (What do we do...split up...!? )</p><hr><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> We can&#39;t save them, abandon the thought! If we lose even one man here, we&#39;re all dead!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> You felt the power of the Mors just now, we all know it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> —but—!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (I know that...but, still...! )</p><hr><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Good grief, you don&#39;t know when to give up, do you, [♂ boy /♀ girl]? Screw it, use a Command Spell on me!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> If I&#39;m strengthened, I should be able to hold them off on my own! This is where I&#39;ll retire from here, then!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> It&#39;s a poor end to our agreement, but it&#39;s better than being wiped out because we&#39;re being burdened by our thoughts!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Eh—hold on, it&#39;s not that easy,</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> No, that won&#39;t be necessary! Look, something&#39;s kicking up dust in the northern district!</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> That&#39;s the Child of Prophecy in black armor!</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> She jumped from the castle&#39;s bell tower and is kicking Mors left and right!</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> Amazing, amazing! Ah, it seems she&#39;s all alone, that can&#39;t be good!</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> But still, she isn&#39;t losing! She&#39;ll be able to handle the Mors in the northern district!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Mash...!</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Yeah, I guess Spriggan&#39;s little lies didn&#39;t work on that girl.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> If she can hold down the northern district, then it&#39;ll be fine! We just have to keep defending the south!</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Everyone, this is our moment of truth! This is when we stand to defend Norwich!</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> Yes, we won&#39;t lose to that Child of Prophecy over there!</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> We will stand our ground here, and let everyone see that Artoria is the real thing!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> How many are there now!? They just keep coming! I&#39;m not even gonna count past fifty!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> We&#39;re about to fall apart over here, how about you!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> —, —</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Still, somehow...!</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Fujimaru!? Hold on, take a deep breath!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You&#39;re relying too heavily on your Mystic Code! You&#39;re exceeding the limits of your Magical Energy Life-Force Conversion!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You need to get back and rest! Immediate administration of active ampoule!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Roger...that...!</p><hr><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> There&#39;s another swarm of Mors coming in from the harbour! No way...there are probably over 500 of them! No, even more!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> That bastard&#39;s finally pulled the trigger. Da Vinci-chan, how&#39;s our time!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yeah, we made it! About an hour!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> There aren&#39;t any residents left to evacuate, so we should retreat to the shelter!</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> ...Huh? That&#39;s not...those aren&#39;t Mors...</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> They&#39;re fae...they&#39;re coming from over there...they were hiding in that building.</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> Are they fleeing this way? Why? They were safe inside—</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> — What? Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Gareth...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What&#39;s happening at the harbour...?</p><hr><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> — Uh. Ugh, buh...!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Gareth!?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> She&#39;s just frightened. She&#39;s not hurt! It&#39;s because she was looking directly at that thing!</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> It seems to be causing mental disruptions in fairies!</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Even the fairies that were hiding in the harbor district are fleeing here in panic!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That&#39;s not good. We can&#39;t fit all those people in the shelter!</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> We&#39;ve got an even bigger problem. If that thing touches ground, the entire city itself will be destroyed!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Can that thing move!? No, of course it can, it just came out here!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Is this what they call the Calamity!? Then, what&#39;s with the rain clouds in the sky!?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> We can think about that later, da Vinci! Artoria, Fujimaru, what&#39;s the plan?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Earlier, we decided to ignore the northern district, but that&#39;s no longer feasible.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> We can stay here and go down with Norwich, or we can prioritise our own lives.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Those are the only two options, there&#39;s no other way. —If we hurry, we can still make it out.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> You get it, right? Your job is to cleanse the Calamity, protecting Norwich is just a bonus.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Think about it from that perspective.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> —</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> —</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...(I get it too. We have no chance of winning...)</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I know how you feel, but we have to retreat now! We couldn&#39;t win even if you could fight properly!</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Let&#39;s withdraw for the time being, and figure out the Calamity&#39;s weak spot!</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> It&#39;s not your fault Norwich is going to fall, this is just the way things have to be!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> That...may be so...but...we&#39;ll take that thing down somehow—</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Take it down—</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Artoria...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What are you seeing...?</p><hr><p><strong>Castoria Monologue:</strong> —Faintly.</p><p><strong>Castoria Monologue:</strong> I awoke to the sound of a bell ringing out, far away.</p><p><strong>Castoria Monologue:</strong> When I woke up in my warm bed, I had a clear premonition.</p><p><strong>Castoria Monologue:</strong> “Perhaps today, the Calamity will come. ”</p><p><strong>Castoria Monologue:</strong> I would always wake up to the sound of bells. Suddenly, a storm would arrive without warning.</p><p><strong>Castoria Monologue:</strong> It was the same in Tintagel.</p><p><strong>Castoria Monologue:</strong> It was an ordinary morning, but that day was the end of my normal routines to come.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> ...No way...I&#39;m not confident enough...</p><p><strong>Castoria Monologue:</strong> Thanks to everyone else, I&#39;ve gotten better, but it&#39;s still unreasonable.</p><p><strong>Castoria Monologue:</strong> I lack confidence. I lack strength. I lack qualifications. Saving Britain is still but a dream.</p><p><strong>Castoria Monologue:</strong> Shall I run away? That is what I think every time I wake up.</p><p><strong>Castoria Monologue:</strong> But I am the Child of Prophecy. That is who I was raised to be.</p><p><strong>Castoria Monologue:</strong> Everyone in the village saw me off with that expectation, even at the cost of their own lives.</p><p><strong>Castoria Monologue:</strong> That is why I have to do my best. I have to overcome the weakness inside me.</p><p><strong>Castoria Monologue:</strong> —To be honest, I don&#39;t really care about anything else.</p><p><strong>Castoria Monologue:</strong> But I absolutely won&#39;t betray that star. Not a chance.</p><p><strong>Castoria Monologue:</strong> Ah—but this is impossible. It is simply impossible. I know it is.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Those are the only two options, there&#39;s no other way. —If we hurry, we can still make it out.</p><p><strong>Castoria Monologue:</strong> I can run. That&#39;s what everyone is saying. No one will blame me for running here.</p><p><strong>Castoria Monologue:</strong> They will only be disappointed, that&#39;s all.</p><p><strong>Castoria Monologue:</strong> You can always make up for disappointments. You can always be forgiven through further achievements.</p><p><strong>Castoria Monologue:</strong> So I wanted to tell them we would run away, but I am surprised at how I was so hesitant to say so.</p><p><strong>Castoria Monologue:</strong> “I want to run. I can&#39;t do it. I&#39;m scared. No, but...but...but...”</p><p><strong>Castoria Monologue:</strong> When I look to my side, there [♂ he /♀ she] is, looking up at that thing with the same face as me.</p><p><strong>Castoria Monologue:</strong> Fujimaru is the same as me.</p><p><strong>Castoria Monologue:</strong> Forced to do things we cannot possibly do. Sent into battles we don&#39;t have the strength to fight.</p><p><strong>Castoria Monologue:</strong> And yet we cannot turn it down, so here we stand.</p><p><strong>Castoria Monologue:</strong> Then I&#39;ll be the first to say, it&#39;s okay to run.</p><p><strong>Castoria Monologue:</strong> That&#39;s right. I chose in [♂ his /♀ her] stead. I was about to tell them all we should run away for [♂ his /♀ her] sake.</p><p><strong>Castoria Monologue:</strong> Then I saw that figure.</p><p><strong>Castoria Monologue:</strong> A star pushing their way through the crowd, rushing toward the Calamity.</p><p><strong>Castoria Monologue:</strong> Running straight at that thing with firm determination, having swallowed their fear.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The image of the other Child of Prophecy. And so...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Seeing this, power returned to Fujimaru&#39;s eyes.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> ...Mash...what a shame. Didn&#39;t she have any friends around who could stop her?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> But it can&#39;t be helped...she&#39;s already a “Child of Prophecy”.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> This is what the people around her wished for, and what she has chosen to do.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I guess dying here is the story she has chosen to tell.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Fujimaru...I don&#39;t really know how to say this, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> —Hold the fort here!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;ll be going, da Vinci!</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> What the hell!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> What are you saying!? I&#39;m coming with you! Oberon! Take care of evacuating the fairies, please!</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> —Amazing. I didn&#39;t expect this kind of development...</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> It&#39;s alright, you should go! Sometimes brute courage is what&#39;s needed!</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I believe in the power of you Chaldeans, after all, you&#39;ve made it this far!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That giant, it&#39;s descending towards the harbour! That&#39;s an amazing way to attack. Or maybe it&#39;s prostrating!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Either way, it&#39;ll completely annihilate the harbour! Fujimaru, is there anything on your mind!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Where did Mash go!?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> She&#39;s already at the pier! She&#39;s deploying her Round Shield!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> She&#39;s going to take that thing on by herself! Even Mash can&#39;t handle that kind of mass!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Here&#39;s my suggestion as your technical advisor: “if you turn back now, you can save yourself, Fujimaru! ”</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Is there really any reason for you to win this fight!?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> So—is there a need for you to care?</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> If Mash will never remember you? If she will never return to being the girl you once knew?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That—</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> —is why!</p><hr><p><strong>Narration:</strong> —Now then, let&#39;s resume her story for just a moment.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> “If you do as I say, the other chiefs will never know. I can keep you hidden, even from the Queen&#39;s eyes. ”</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Those were the silver-tongued words of Spriggan, which had not sat right with her.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> When she found out that the Mors had appeared, she did not bother with the heavily guarded ground floor exit.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> She climbed up the castle&#39;s bell tower, and jumped down into Norwich without hesitation!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> With a thunderous roar, a thunderous boom, and thunderous movement! No, thunderous movement isn&#39;t quite right, that was simply gravity at work.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Once down in the city of Norwich, she attracted the horde of Mors and evacuated the fairies to safety.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Then came the big one. The cursed hand of ■■■■■■■■■ rose from the sea.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> As one would expect, she stumbled at the sight, but when she saw the screaming fairies, she pulled herself together.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> She rushed into the harbour without hesitation and confronted the cursed hand at the end of the pier.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (This is—)</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> She realised at once that she could not stop it on her own. Even if she gave everything she had, she could not stop the inevitable destruction.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Even so—!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Even so, she could mitigate some of the damage.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Even though the harbor would be destroyed, the damage could be lessened somewhat, and the residential district might be saved.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> That prospect was enough for her, and when she deployed her shield, she saw something unbelievable.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That...person—</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Running into the harbour was the human she had met at the square.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> An inexplicable surge of joy and relief overflooded her heart, and so she could not help but raise her voice.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Run away! Don&#39;t come over here! I can&#39;t hold it off for more than a few more seconds...!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> But her desperate shouting did not prevent the human&#39;s approach.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Could [♂ he /♀ she] not hear her hesitant voice over the shield clashing against the curse?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Unbelievably, [♂ he /♀ she] ran across the pier with a voice louder than even hers, shouting “I&#39;m not gonna let you lose! ”</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> [♂ His /♀ Her] hand touched her back, as if to support her. As if to tell her that [♂ he /♀ she] would not leave her side.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ah—</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> That concern for her filled her with so much joy, and she finally remembered being human.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Indeed, and because she was human, she felt the pain, and the fear.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The fear that she would let those who believed in her be hurt.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m the Child of Prophecy, leave me be...! I&#39;ll be fine, just run away—!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> And so she held on strong until the very end. Saying it would be all right, like a child telling a lie they knew were poor.</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong> I proclaim through my Command Spell!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Eh—?</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong> I don&#39;t care whether you&#39;re the Child of Prophecy or not—</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The voice resounded from behind her. From her heart to her fingertips, her fiery blood pumped throughout her body.</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong> Mash, give us all a show we&#39;ll never forget!!!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> With this, the Prophecy had been overturned.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Even Ainsel&#39;s own premonition could not have foretold this scene.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (Ah—I get it now. I&#39;ll do that, Master. )</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The chalk wall repelled the cursed hand. That thing could not stand against the walls of Camelot.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The thing recognized the creature in front of itself as its enemy, attempting to thwart the collapse.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Something that would prevent the Calamity. A small-scale adversary, standing there to save the Fairy Kingdom.</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong> You&#39;re doing it, Mash! Push it back!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The familiar voice awakened what resided within her. It was neither Annis nor the Child of Prophecy that was found there.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> It was the knight who had inherited the holy shield. A servant of Chaldea. Indeed.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, Master!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Please lend me your strength! I&#39;ll do everything I can to purge this place of the Calamity!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Because—because! I may not be the Child of Prophecy, but even so...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> My heart! It&#39;s crying out to protect this city!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> That girl&#39;s name is Mash Kyrielight.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> She, who everyone had believed to be the Child of Prophecy, was finally allowed to be selfish.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No way...the Calamity is vanishing...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...We did it. We did it, we really did it, Senpai!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Amazing, we really managed to beat the Calamity!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You did it, Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ah...yes. T-this isn&#39;t the time to rejoice, though...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Mash Kyrielight has returned. I apologize for any inconvenience I&#39;ve caused.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yeah. Welcome back, Mash. We&#39;re so glad you made it back safe.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve got a story to tell, but we&#39;ll get to that once we&#39;re settled in.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> We have a local associate you&#39;d probably like to meet. Or should I say, “companion”?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Oh, here she comes. Hey, over here, over here!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Let me introduce you. This is Mash, Fujimaru&#39;s main servant.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Mash, this is Artoria Caster. She&#39;s Fujimaru&#39;s owner.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> She is the King Arthur of this Lostbelt, the Child of Prophecy, and a powerful magus.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Eh—nononono, I&#39;m not that strong or King Arthur or the Child of Prophecy or...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I&#39;m so embarrassed that you would say that in front of the likes of the incredibly strong Mash, I could just die...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I&#39;m sorry that I couldn&#39;t lift a finger to help you out of the Nameless Forest,</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I&#39;m sorry that I couldn&#39;t be of any help against the Calamity, I&#39;m so sorry that I&#39;m so weak...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A-Artoria...! But you&#39;re the real Child of Prophecy...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No, no, no, what am I saying! I should apologize for introducing myself as the Child of Prophecy! I was just trying to comprehend what you meant when you said Senpai&#39;s “owner”, and then my mind went completely blank but then I realized da Vinci, that pain in the butt, was using it as a distraction to hide the fact that Senpai is a human from Chaldea!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> —</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> —</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> They hit it off just like that!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> All thanks to da Vinci-chan...I guess?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Nuh-uh, it&#39;s the high spirits!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I knew you two would hit it off, even though you are so different!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Well, then. “Cleanse the Calamity” and “Meet up with Mash”.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> We&#39;ve completed those two things in one go, but there&#39;s still one more thing we need to do in Norwich.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Indeed, the Pilgrim&#39;s Bell. Now that we&#39;re here, why don&#39;t we ring it?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> That&#39;s...a little...I couldn&#39;t do something like that...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> It was Mash and Fujimaru who drove back the Calamity.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I don&#39;t think I&#39;m qualified to ring the bell right now...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s not true.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m sure you tried to protect Norwich as best as you could.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It was just a coincidence that I was the one who managed to drive back the Calamity.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Just because I did that, doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m the Child of Prophecy.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I just did it because it&#39;s what I wanted. I&#39;m no different than you, Artoria.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So please, ring the Pilgrim&#39;s Bell. I&#39;ll have a talk with Spriggan myself.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> I s-see!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> You&#39;re a good person, Mash!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> From what Fujimaru told me, this isn&#39;t how I pictured you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Is that the sound of rain?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...By the way, the Calamity Pool is still there...</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You&#39;re right. We repelled the Calamity, so why are those clouds still—</p><p>Note! Mash Protects Us From Water Mirror cutscene</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Everyone, look out—!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Mash?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Oww...I was sent flying like a ball...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Huh? Mash?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> —</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Mash...is gone—</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Mash. Mash...!</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong> Ah, you saw it happen right in front of you, so don&#39;t you get it? She was protecting you, and now she&#39;s gone.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> That right there was Morgan&#39;s Water Mirror. Originally, it was supposed to be used against the Calamity.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> It was such a flashy plot twist, but it&#39;s taken a long time to set up.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Seriously, you outsider humans are so careless. Or were you led wherever the wind took you?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Well, it doesn&#39;t matter either way. It doesn&#39;t change what I have to do.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Come now, this is no time to be falling on your ass, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Don&#39;t fret, Mash is fine. She&#39;s just not here.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> The Water Mirror is a transference spell. She&#39;s somewhere else in Britain by now.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Don&#39;t worry. You&#39;ll be reunited before long. If you don&#39;t, I&#39;ll be upset.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> When that time comes, the bride&#39;s prince will have to rise up as graceful as ever.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Who are you...!?</p><hr><p><strong>G：???:</strong> Ooh, you&#39;ve got spirit, don&#39;t you? You&#39;ve just barely made it out.</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong> Pleased to meet you, Chaldeans. I am Habetrot.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> I am...Well, let&#39;s just say I&#39;m like Mash&#39;s personal assistant.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> A friendly fae who will help you out on your journey, free of charge.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> That is, until you&#39;re reunited with Mash, at least. You should feel honored!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Whaa, the food here is too delicious! The stuff back at Sheffield has nothing on this!</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Ah, is that pasta? Is that what you call it? Can I have some more? It&#39;s so fun to twirl!</p><p><strong>Red Rabbit:</strong> M-hay I have another slice of the carrot-colored cake, or perhaps another two?</p><p><strong>Red Rabbit:</strong> I went around the river and hurried to Norwich, only to find that everything is already over...</p><p><strong>Red Rabbit:</strong> If I don&#39;t suppress this heartbreak with things of sweet nature, there is no way I will be able to go back to pulling that carriage.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> It&#39;s a good thing you were able to save Norwich. And without pause we have gained several more odd companions, it seems?</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> However, the situation has grown somewhat complicated.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> You were able to reunite with Mash, but were immediately separated again.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> And outside—</p><p><strong>Fairies Gathering Outside:</strong> Child of Prophecy! Child of Prophecy!</p><p><strong>Fairies Gathering Outside:</strong> The Child of Prophecy saved Norwich! The Child of Prophecy will defeat the Queen!</p><p><strong>Fairies Gathering Outside:</strong> We are no longer at Morgan&#39;s mercy!</p><p><strong>Fairies Gathering Outside:</strong> The Child of Prophecy saved us! It is time for us to return the favor!</p><p><strong>Fairies Gathering Outside:</strong> Route all weapon shipments to Londinium! Stop all deliveries to Camelot!</p><p><strong>Fairies Gathering Outside:</strong> Child of Prophecy! Child of Prophecy! Let&#39;s hear it for the true king of Britain!</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> We did it! This is a huge win for you, Artoria!</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> ...It seems so. Perhaps a bit too huge. You protected Norwich without fault, and even managed to repel the Calamity.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> But the fairies of Norwich are now devoting all their sympathies to the Child of Prophecy. With this, there is no way the Queen will sit idly by.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Her army will come. The Calamity has passed, but a war will soon break out between fairy soldiers.</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> Ah...I see, this will clearly turn into an insurrection...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I&#39;m also concerned by Mash, who was spirited away by Morgan&#39;s Water Mirror.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> And the fairies keep going on about how “there&#39;s no more danger” and “we&#39;ll all be able to reunite”.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> Right, right. Habenyan is out of ideas, too.</p><p><strong>Habetrot:</strong> However, I do know going on a desperate search right now would be a bad move. All good things must come to an end, inscrutable are the ways of heaven.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Habenyan? Is that what you&#39;re called? You&#39;re a bit of a proverbial fairy, aren&#39;t you...</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> Either way, for the time being, you shouldn&#39;t carelessly just rush outside.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> If you do, it might further incite the fairies of Norwich to rebel against the Queen.</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> It would be best to sneak out of the city under the cover of night. That is, assuming you know where to go.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Where to go...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Should we head back to Salisbury for now?</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> No. We managed to exorcise the Calamity and save Norwich.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> We can&#39;t let this feat go to waste.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> In the first place, we were never supposed to be allowed this opportunity. “The Calamity will be repelled, but Norwich will fall. ”</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> That&#39;s part of the prophecy. I&#39;ve kept it to myself until now.</p><p>Note! Scene Change</p><p><strong>Count Peperon:</strong> ...Then you will go to meet Spriggan? To have him compensate you for protecting Norwich.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Yeah. The fairies of Norwich will back us up against Spriggan.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> “Let her ring the Pilgrim&#39;s Bell. The citizens of Norwich will break down your door if you don&#39;t! ”</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Stuff like that.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> I&#39;ll comply, of course! I wouldn&#39;t dare refuse the saviors of Norwich!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Just like that!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...Huh? This fairy...</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> What is it? Is there something on my face? Huh, there isn&#39;t. Then, shall we continue our conversation?</p><hr><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> The bell tower is just beyond here. As my loyalty still lies with Her Majesty the Queen, I cannot take you there myself, but...</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> If you were to go and ring it on your own, I wouldn&#39;t be able to stop you.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> It would simply be my fault for being careless around you, that&#39;s all.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> She would be able to take such a thing into consideration.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Right, you&#39;re too scared of animosity from the public, after all.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Let&#39;s go up, Artoria. We&#39;ll ring it and get out of here.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> ...Artoria?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> ...I&#39;m sorry. I can&#39;t ring the bell of Norwich.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> To ring this bell would mean declaring war against Her Majesty Morgan.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> ...It isn&#39;t something I&#39;m ready to do.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Not to mention...it was Mash who saved Norwich.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> It wasn&#39;t me the people of Norwich hailed.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> Ho-ho. Well, well.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> Someone with an eye for the times, huh? I&#39;m quite impressed.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> You&#39;re such a naive-looking thing, after all...Indeed, to ring the bell here would go against your morals.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> Unless of course, you would have armies march and further blood spill.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> Ha? Why&#39;s that?</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> Because there remain countless people loyal to Her Majesty the Queen.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> After all, she is the one who has protected Britain from the Mors for the past 2,000 years.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> Regardless of how despotic her rule might be, her accomplishments are rock-solid.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> Most would not go against someone like that just because it was “spoken of in a prophecy”.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> Who would be in the right? Who would hold the position of integrity?</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> If they cannot answer that, the Child of Prophecy is nothing more than an invader...</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> You would be barbarians, no different from the Saxons.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> In other words, you&#39;re suggesting we send a message before we act? A declaration of our cause, and our denunciation of the Queen.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> Exactly. In fact, if you were to prepare such a thing, I would personally see that it was delivered to Her Majesty...</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> Although there is no need for such things now. Just before, I was in conversation with Her Majesty.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> “In recognition of their good luck in saving Norwich, the Child of Prophecy and her foreign visitors are hereby invited to an audience with the Queen. ”</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> With cause of their unusual accomplishment, they will be treated as honored guests, and I will hear any proposal they put forth,“ she said.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> —!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (The Queen wants us to go meet her in person...! )</p><hr><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> No way. If we go, we&#39;ll definitely be killed!</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> Did you really think we would fall for such a blatantly obvious trap, Morgan!?</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> No, no. Her Majesty may be ruthless, but she abides by her decorum.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> As Her Majesty has stated that you shall be received as her guests, your safety is absolutely guaranteed.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> A ruler is one who stays true to their word, after all.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> How else could the six clans be consolidated?</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> ...I see. Just like we require a declaration to start a war,</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> the Queen can&#39;t simply kill the Child of Prophecy without pretext.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> In fact, that&#39;s how Norwich was saved.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> As a political figurehead, she would need to prove to the people who is right and who is wrong.</p><p><strong>Senji Muramasa:</strong> In that case, it&#39;s just a matter of mutual questioning. To gauge the other party&#39;s worth.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I see it the same as Muramasa. Moreoever, I would really like to know more about the Queen.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> So far, we only really know that her name is Morgan.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I want to question her myself, to confirm what it is she wants, what it is she desires.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> However, I will only go if our safety both there and back will be guaranteed.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> If antagonism arises during the audience, I need a promise that there will be a truce in place.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> Of course. All that has already been promised.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> All the details are in this letter. A copy has already been sent out to all the clan heads.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> So, with all that...what do you think, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> If she&#39;s this thorough, we&#39;ll face her.</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Why are you being so belligerent about this!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...I mean, this means she has us cornered...</p><hr><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> Aa...what a grim face...</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> ...Yeah. I get it. To be honest, I&#39;m pretty pissed off as well.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> What the hell does she mean, “lucky”?</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> We all worked so hard, Mash too! “Luck”, my ass!</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> I see. If everyone has made up their mind, I guess that will be our decision.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> In this case, Artoria&#39;s decision to not want to ring the bell also makes sense.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> If she rings the bell now, the Queen and Child of Prophecy would become political enemies.</p><p><strong>Oberon:</strong> In such a case, I imagine this invitation would become void, is that right, Spriggan?</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> Who knows, I wouldn&#39;t be able to say.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> Oberon, was it? A troublesome fairy, aren&#39;t you? The kind not found in the Fairy Kingdom.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> I&#39;ll send a messenger to the Count&#39;s mansion first thing in the morning. Afterwards, I would like for you to meet up with the soldiers outside the city.</p><p><strong>Artoria:</strong> ...Her Majesty&#39;s troops will escort us. Just in case, may I ask who will lead this escort?</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> Of course. The unit sent will be the First Imperial Cavalry of the Mors Extermination Division. Their captain&#39;s name is Gawain.</p><p><strong>Spriggan:</strong> Indeed, our pride and joy, Fairy Knight Gawain will most definitely lead you safely to Camelot.</p><p>Note! Scene Change</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> Huh? What was that? I couldn&#39;t quite hear you, Lady Spinel.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> Could you repeat that, please? What was that about the black Child of Prophecy?</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> I told you, she died in Norwich. She was struck by mother&#39;s Water Mirror.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Her body and armor both disappeared completely. There wasn&#39;t even a finger left.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> It&#39;s no surprise! She was surprisingly strong, but against my mother she couldn&#39;t last for a single second. Kyahaha!</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> She no longer has to suffer just on the inside.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> Beryl? Hey, Beryl, what&#39;s wrong? Did I say something wrong?</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> —What&#39;s that? That&#39;s just hogwash.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> That&#39;s just ordinary news, Lady Spinel. Your typical spread of misinformation. It&#39;s hardly even enough to call a joke.</p><p><strong>Fairy Knight Tristan:</strong> ...? Mash, she was your sweetheart, wasn&#39;t she? She died, how&#39;s that ordinary news?</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> Mash simply DISAPPEARED, didn&#39;t she? If there&#39;s no body, that means she&#39;s alive.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> In the first place—</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> I have to die first. Mash would never go and die before I do. Not a chance.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> That&#39;s how the goddess of love made this world.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> No matter what, Mash will always fall into my lap.</p><p><strong>Beryl:</strong> There might be ups and downs along the way, but it&#39;s bound to happen. Isn&#39;t that what being soulmates is all about?</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div><footer class="page-meta"><div class="meta-item edit-link"><a class="external-link meta-item-label" href="https://github.com/r-grandorder/wiki/edit/main/src/Lostbelt/avalon1.md" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" aria-label="Help us improve this page!"><!--[--><!--]--> Help us improve this page! <span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewbox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span><!--[--><!--]--></a></div><div class="meta-item last-updated"><span class="meta-item-label">Last Updated: </span><!----></div><div class="meta-item contributors"><span class="meta-item-label">Contributors: </span><span class="meta-item-info"><!--[--><!--[--><span class="contributor" title="email: blameramamod@gmail.com">Fgrandorder</span><!----><!--]--><!--]--></span></div></footer><!----><!--[--><!--]--></main><!--]--></div><!----><!--]--></div>
