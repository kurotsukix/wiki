May I have a word with you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Welcome, Hundred Personas.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Welcome, Asako.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Why did you call me that?</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> ...No, never mind.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> As we are a conglomerate, our existence is unique.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Even though you are contracted with multiple Servants, things involving us are sure to still bewilder you.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> And calling us by name is probably one of them. We are fine with whatever name you choose to differentiate us.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Hello, Hundred Personas. What a surprise to see you in Senpai&#39;s room.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I just brought over some tea. Would you like to join us?</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> No, if Master is busy, that&#39;s fine. Please excuse us.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Wait, wait.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Did something happen?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, please wait. If you leave now, I will not be able to enjoy tea time because I will be so curious.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> If you have something on your mind, please do not hesitate to mention it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh. Is it something that you cannot say because I&#39;m around? If so, I can leave\u2013</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> ...No, actually we wanted to ask Master a favor.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> A favor?</p><hr><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Yes. We need the assistance of someone familiar with the layout of Chaldea and who knows where people in it can be found.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Which is to say, we will probably need Mash&#39;s help, too.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> If you don&#39;t mind, we would like you to listen, too, Mash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Of course. If there is anything I can do, I&#39;m happy to help.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So...what is this favor?</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Well, to put it simply: we would like you to help us find somebody.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Find...somebody?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> If you&#39;re looking for a staff member or Servant, we can just use the PA system to ask them to come here.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> We considered that approach, but if she could answer such a call, we would have found her a long time ago.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Actually, ever since we were Summoned, we have been looking for her in our spare time.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> We did not go as far as make an announcement, but we did shout out her name, peek inside rooms, and check all the hallways.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> But since we still haven&#39;t come across her...</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> She either doesn&#39;t want to answer the call, or she simply can&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> That was our conclusion. That&#39;s why we need to search for her.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I see...this is starting to sound like a case that needs to be solved!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So who is this person you are searching for?</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> ...Um, well...it&#39;s quite embarrassing, but...</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> it&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Hm? Um, you were kind of mumbling there, so I didn&#39;t hear you.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> A-anyway! We&#39;re all in good hands now that Master and Mash are here to help us!</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Now let&#39;s get out there and start searching!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, she headed out so eagerly...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> There&#39;s still so many questions left, but let&#39;s just go after Hundred Personas, Senpai!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Do you have any clues?</p><hr><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Well, she is almost certainly inside Chaldea, but other than that, we have no clues.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So you&#39;re going into this blind?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> To search every nook and cranny somewhere as vast as Chaldea could take a long time!</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> There is no need for concern. We have full knowledge of her personality, characteristics, and abilities.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> We have some limited insight into what might happen around her, or what she might do...</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> So we ask Master to lead us to places where she might be.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I see...rather than sleuthing, you already have a few places in mind to search.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Exactly. Now, the first place we would like to go is...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This...is where you wanted to go...</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Interesting...here...</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Then, let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um, why are you pulling out your dagger and swinging it around before you enter!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Hundred Personas? Hundred Personas!?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Dufufufu...pretty girl figurines are the BEST. It&#39;s like two and three dimensions got together and made the baby of my dreams!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> This plump yet oh so flat belly is to DIE for... Ahhh, this sculpt is a work of ART!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> That devilish whim called adolescence...the wonderful transition between girlhood and womanhood that lasts only the briefest of moments...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> This delicate balance can only be expressed through microscopic adjustments...a technique and craftsmanship that can only be achieved by steady-handed experts.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> That soft skin...and the bouncy bits...all to convey that age. It&#39;s so...ah, marvelous!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong></p><p>Nugh!? This Blackbeard&#39;s eyes can&#39;t be deceived! Th-this figure...has cast-off parts?!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Colchis Brand figures...always a high quality brand!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> You never disappoint. It&#39;s already a superb piece of work...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> But to put even more curvaceous elements and incorporate the third-dimensional sense of being able to take off clothes...!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> This has gotta be a challenge for the great Blackbeard. Taunting me! To strip it, or not to strip it...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> But don&#39;t underestimate me! I don&#39;t have a problem displaying my figures in my room after they&#39;ve been stripped!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Even if my parents see them, I would proudly declare: \u201CMom, Dad, this is my girlfriend!\u201D</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> This is how a REAL man lives!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> ...And now, if you&#39;ll excuse me... I&#39;ll take a little taste...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Aaagh!?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> ...Oh no...the edge of the figure&#39;s clothes...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Apologize! Apologize to the expert craftsman (aka Medea) who worked so tirelessly on every frill of the figure&#39;s skirt!</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Tsk. We missed.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What was that all about!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Even pervy otaku like Blackbeard have rights. Maybe.</p><hr><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Hmph. You saw what kind of man he is.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> He loves cute things to an almost sickening level, and his greed drives to make them his own. And he feels joy from managing and observing them...</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> If the one we are searching for has been captured, this creep would naturally be the first suspect.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The reason why Hundred Personas cannot find who they are looking for is because they&#39;ve been captured and imprisoned by Blackbeard!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Th-that&#39;s a bit far-fetched\u2013</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Totally! I&#39;m being framed! Totally blameless!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> There are tons of angels in Chaldea of prime age, like Mary and Jack...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> But that&#39;s exactly why I always try to interact with such angels at the borderline acceptable level!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> After all, if I \u201Caccidentally\u201D touch or hug them, I&#39;d get killed!</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> But that only means that if there were no such risks, you WOULD do that sort of thing.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> The one we&#39;re seeking is not risky or dangerous at all. They are just small. Just cute.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Eh? What kind of rare angel is that? Are they around? Where? Where&#39;s my camera???</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> We knew it.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> There&#39;s a possibility that he would trick them with enticing words, or drag them back to his lair.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Fess up. Refuse, and it&#39;s just a matter of us annihilating you first, or we can search your room!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Tch... Give me a break.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Blackbeard may be bad, but I&#39;m no low-level scum who can&#39;t be proud his own way of life.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> If I were to fall in love with a girl, it&#39;d only be because it&#39;s mutual. I&#39;d get her parents&#39; permission!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> And then head off to a church to get married. That&#39;s the route to a True End!</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong></p><p>Th-there&#39;s no way we&#39;re giving her away to scum like you! We will not allow it!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This has taken a turn for the insane, but let&#39;s try to calm things down, Senpai!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Fuuuuuu!!!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Here I was in MY OWN room, minding my business, just admiring my lovely figures, and you go all aggro! What did I do to deserve this!?</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> ...Not here. We were wrong.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> I told you I didn&#39;t know what you were on about as soon as you got here...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> My brand new figure...broken...ungh...Blackbeard&#39;s gonna cry... (Sniff)...</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Ugh. Don&#39;t cry while we&#39;re here. Disgusting.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> SHOCK!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You mustn&#39;t, Hundred Personas. Blackbeard may be bad, but he&#39;s a pure-hearted dreamer when it comes to his hobbies.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Even if disavowing his hobby is the right thing to do, it&#39;ll only result in his mental collapse!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> What, it&#39;s okay to insult me in front of my face now!? Even you are so cruel today, Miss Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Give it up...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Just accept it...</p><hr><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> It was all just a misunderstanding. The one we&#39;re looking for is not here.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> We must apologize.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong></p><p>Apology!? Do you think apologizing will fix my poor, beloved figure!?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> This...this girl...an elven-eared craftsman worked her hardest to make this figure by hand. There&#39;s no chance of getting another one...</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Hm. Will you accept our apology if this thing gets fixed? We&#39;ll send Dew Painter over to you later.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> WH-WHAT!? You can fix it?</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Hah...don&#39;t underestimate the Hundred Personas. Our one hundred specializations are not just on the battlefield.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Dew Painter, as that name suggests, can paint anything in any color and is an expert at befuddling the enemy through coloring.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> He should be an expert in sculpting, if I remember correctly. He did say that magical reconstruction is one of his favorite tasks.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> To further improve this figure to match your greatest desire should be no harder than a snap of the fingers to him.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> ...!!!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> APOLOGY ACCEPTED.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> So, first I want these knee-high socks to be gone to show off her healthy thicc legs, and I&#39;ll add glasses, a recorder instrument, and a ribbon...and her clothes will be partially off, and her sides...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um, maybe you hit him a on the head a little too hard... He&#39;s fainted, but he&#39;s still grinning...</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> So we were wrong about the first suspect, but we cannot give up yet.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Let&#39;s head to the next suspect. Master, Mash. Please lead the way.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Based on what happened with Blackbeard, we&#39;re looking for someone small and cute.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll find them soon.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. Let&#39;s keep that positive attitude.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I hope we find them.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Someone small and cute... Well, there are a lot of people like that in Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> If that&#39;s all we have to go on...</p><hr><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> She&#39;s shy, so you&#39;ve definitely never met her before.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Please let us know if you see someone fitting that description immediately.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> By the way, who is looking for this person?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Is it just you, Asako?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Is it just you?</p><hr><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> No, this is very important to all of us. I am not the only one looking. The rest of the personas are also on the lookout.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Hn...speak of the devil. Take a look. Gozul the Strong is over there.</p><p><strong>Gozul the Strong:</strong> Hnnnngh!</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> Hahaha. Good work! That&#39;s the spirit!</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> ...Oh crap. This is no time to laugh. I&#39;ll lose my grip if I don&#39;t keep my stomach taut.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> You&#39;re as strong as you look! You&#39;re no Grendel, but you still got some potential!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> That ain&#39;t fair, Wulf. Were you all talk when you said you&#39;d end it in an instant? This ain&#39;t a competition of stamina.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> I&#39;m a big idiot who enjoys a game of arm wrestling or two. A valiant match is nice and all, but hurry up and switch\u2013</p><p><strong>Gozul the Strong:</strong> ...(Makes a \u201Ccome at me\u201D gesture)</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> Oh? Don&#39;t tell me you want me to get in on this, too!?</p><p><strong>Gozul the Strong:</strong> ...(Grin)</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> Whooo! This guy&#39;s tough! This&#39;ll be GOLDEN! This guy&#39;s gonna go up against me and Wulf at the same time...one with each arm!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> Heh, you&#39;re underestimating us! A bastard like you...I love it!</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> Yeah, so laughable. This guy&#39;s got a hothead.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> ...But we can get irritated after the match&#39;s over.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> The information you want from us is more valuable than the two of us. We know not to laugh at that!</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Hm. Looks like Gozul is trying to get those two to tell him the information we need by beating them in an arm wrestling match.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Look at all those bulging muscles...amazing...</p><hr><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Overall combat efficiency aside, Gozul is probably the strongest of all of us when it comes to sheer arm power. I do not think he is at a disadvantage.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Hm. And I see Makul the Quick over there by the halls.</p><p><strong>Makul the Quick:</strong> Fwoosh...!</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Hm. What amazing speed.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> But I won&#39;t lose sight of someone in a footrace! And you are in my turf!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong></p><p>Hey!!! Who&#39;s running in the halls!? WALK QUIETLY. No matter how rushed you are, you do not run!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I will get on Tarasque and chase down rule breakers to the ends of the earth!!!</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> And Makul&#39;s doing some kind of competition of his own. I see...a hunter&#39;s eyes may have spotted her.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> And...oh, there&#39;s Zayed the Base over there.</p><p><strong>Zayed the Base:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Ungh! Impressive!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> As the Roman Emperor, the incarnation of art itself...and obviously versed in dance, too...I am impressed with your graceful, elegant movements!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> You are no ordinary person! Surely you must be able to gracefully avoid security sensors like that!</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> You&#39;re right. They possess unique and wonderful rhythm. I&#39;m learning a lot, tee hee.</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> Wait. We can&#39;t just sit here watching, or all we are is an audience. I need to dance my heart out too.</p><p><strong>Zayed the Base:</strong> ...Wait. Why am I in a dance contest? Dancing is hardly my area of exp\u2013</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Well, that&#39;s...yes, Zayed. I don&#39;t think you should worry too much about Zayed. Probably for the best.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um...so all your personas are putting their skills to practical use to collect information on their own.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> That is our strength. Diversity through one hundred specialties.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Someone&#39;s weakness may be someone else&#39;s strength. As such, we have limitless options for moving through the shadows.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> In that area, we believe we are the greatest among the Hassans.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So what&#39;s your strength...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> So what&#39;s your strength, Asako...?</p><hr><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Well, I do have a proper skill I&#39;m versed in...</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> But for some reason, lately I&#39;ve been in the role of gathering and coordinating the others.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> This is likely because there are just so few of us who can communicate with Master properly.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Speaking of communicating, I realize that she also has difficulty doing so...which is why something like this happened in the first place.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Hundred Personas?</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> No, nothing. I&#39;m just talking to myself.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Now, then.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Even though we have one hundred specialties, we are up against famed Heroic Spirits. None of these competitions will be easy.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Since I have a bit of free time, I&#39;m thinking of helping the others out if I get a chance.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What do you mean, \u201Chelp out\u201D?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> A-are we allowed?</p><hr><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> There&#39;s no need to worry, Master.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> After all, we are us.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> All the matches are judged by Hundred Personas. All the matches are witnessed by Hundred Personas.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> We are all one. So, even if someone tickles an opponent&#39;s arm, or maybe sticks out a foot to trip a runner in a race...</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Those are all just methods we might employ to win the competition.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> It is neither cheating nor intervention from an outside party. We are, after all, doing these things ourselves.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I-I-I see...?</p><hr><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Then let us go, Master. Help me help myself!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This gets more confusing the more you think about it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So many Hassans, all part of the same one...this must be what gestaltzerfall is like...</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> (Pant...pant...)</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> Ah! We lost! We lost!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> The moment he started using both arms, I shoulda realized it was a battle royale, not an arm wrestling match!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> Why the hell didn&#39;t I watch out for someone creeping up from behind!</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> Tsk. If only I had one more arm. What, you don&#39;t think I could just GROW one from sheer willpower alone?</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> This wasn&#39;t a footrace. It was an obstacle course. I should have paid closer attention to the rules.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Ungh. Those unpredictable, unexpected motions of yours are well beyond ordinary! If you&#39;d lived in my time, I would have hired you as a court dancer!</p><p><strong>Mata Hari:</strong> Yes, indeed. I&#39;m sure you would have been in great demand at every inn.</p><p><strong>Zayed the Base:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Now, tell us. Tell us everything you know.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> If you know anything about her movements...anything that could give us even a clue...tell us.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> ...We see. If we put everything we have learned together and consider it, we could best summarize it by saying...</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Something fishy is going on with the kids lately.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> The children of Chaldea...?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Do you think that&#39;s true, Hundred Personas?</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> It could be possible. It doesn&#39;t seem that far-fetched of a reason for this.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Reason...?</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Either way, we have some clues now. Let&#39;s go see the children!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Here?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Let&#39;s just knock...</p><hr><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme&#39;s Voice:</strong> Oh, a woodpecker is singing \u201Cknock, knock.\u201D We have visitors. Visitors!</p><p><strong>Jack&#39;s Voice:</strong> Yes? Who&#39;s there?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Jack&#39;s Voice:</strong> Master? Anybody else with you?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. Me and Hundred Personas. May we come in?</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme&#39;s Voice:</strong> ...No.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh?</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme&#39;s Voice:</strong> No means no!</p><p><strong>Jack&#39;s Voice:</strong> If it&#39;s just Mommy and Mash...no. Nobody can come in.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme&#39;s Voice:</strong> Yep, yep. Nobody can absolutely come in!</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Ah, results at last. Now if I may...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh wait, Hundred Personas!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> Grr! I told you, you can&#39;t come in!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> I said so...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s...?</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Ah. So you were here all along.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So this girl is the one you were looking for?</p><hr><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> ...Yes. We&#39;re embarrassed to say so, but that is the me that we were looking for.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> That&#39;s another of the Hundred Personas. Yes, she is another of our personalities.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> B-but she seems a little different than the rest of the Hundred Personas.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Excuse me for saying this, but she doesn&#39;t seem much like a Hassan OR an Assassin...</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Of course not. The specialty of that persona is not knowing or being able to do anything.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What does that mean...?</p><hr><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> To know nothing can sometimes be very useful for an assassin.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> This would be utterly humiliating if it actually happened, but...hypothetically, let&#39;s say we failed a mission and the enemy captured us.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> If we had a persona that knows nothing, then no matter how much they were interrogated, they could not reveal anything, because they do not KNOW anything.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s terrible! A personality to use only under interrogation!?</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> How terrible! Bad! To treat such a cute little girl that way!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> We found her wandering the hallway and heard her story. That&#39;s why we brought her here.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> That&#39;s right. You shouldn&#39;t have to do something you don&#39;t want to! You shouldn&#39;t have to be trapped by a boring and painful fate!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> That&#39;s a book you should just leave closed. That&#39;s why we decided to let her stay here.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> Here, her only job is to enjoy drinking tea and chatting.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> ...She doesn&#39;t talk much, but she is so cute when she eats snacks! Like a little squirrel!</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> I&#39;m grateful you took good care of her until now. But...</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> Are you going to take our friend away?</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> Even though there&#39;s so many of you already?</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> No one else can fill her role. There is no changing the fact that she is one of our faces.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> We cannot have her stay in here forever. Now, come. We&#39;re going home.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> You can&#39;t. We&#39;re not going to let you take our friend!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Right. We just got to be friends! We don&#39;t want to say bye-bye yet.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> We haven&#39;t even learned her name.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> ...I see we have no choice. It appears we must first teach these children to heed their elders!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> P-please be gentle with them, Hundred Personas! Let&#39;s just calm things down so we can talk!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Now that the children have had their spankings...</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> We&#39;re not giving in! We won&#39;t just do whatever mean thing the adults tell us we have to!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> Don&#39;t you hurt our friend!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Hundred Personas...um...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Have mercy on them.</p><hr><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> I cannot believe Mash and Master are looking at us like that...</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> But, it seems there is still some misunderstanding. To restate...</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> Oh...</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Allow us to clarify.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> You have no job at Chaldea. You are not in charge of being interrogated. You are just a part of us.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> ...?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Not in charge of getting interrogated?</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Of course not.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Matters would be different if we were exclusively assassins as we were in life. But now we are Master&#39;s Servant.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> There is no situation in which we would be captured.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> Then...why were you trying to take them back?</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Since we were summoned, this persona never showed her face. Not once.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> This one is still an important part of us. We\u2013all of us\u2013were simply worried about her.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> Worried?</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> That&#39;s right. Gozul, Makul, Zayed...everyone&#39;s looking for you. You should at least put in an appearance so everyone can stop worrying.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> And after that...if you want to come back to your new friends and play, you may do as you like.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> They&#39;re also Master&#39;s Servants. Spending time interacting with others is a good thing.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Hm. Perhaps that is your new role here.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> After all, I&#39;m too embarrassed to join in tea parties like this one.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> ...&#39;Kay. Then I&#39;ll go back.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Yes, let&#39;s go back.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> Oh. Why didn&#39;t you tell us earlier?</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> If she isn&#39;t going to get harmed, and if the people at home are worried, then obviously she should go home once in a while.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> You just need to come here whenever you want to have a tea party!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> When you&#39;ve left all your worries behind, or forgotten them, or just foisted them onto the adults, that&#39;s when we have a great, grand tea party!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> See you again, tiny little Hassan.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Bye-bye.</p><p><strong>Little Hassan:</strong> ...Bye-bye.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I never imagined such a Hassan existed...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, I&#39;m as surprised as you are. She was so tiny and cute.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Surprised? That&#39;s actually our line.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ?</p><hr><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> While we are a conglomerate, we are individuals. We do not, however, have any sort of connection that would allow us to communicate mentally.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> That&#39;s why it took all of us, and so much effort, to find her.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> And that is why she also didn&#39;t know who you are or what your purpose is.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> And that&#39;s probably why she didn&#39;t want to leave the children&#39;s room.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I see.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So this all happened because she didn&#39;t know what sort of Master Senpai is.</p><p><strong>Little Hassan:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Hehe... As a Servant who has spent a lot of time contracted with Master, I can tell you this much:</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> As long as we are here, we won&#39;t ever let you get hurt. Absolutely not.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> And like the other Hundred Personas, you won&#39;t have to do the sort of dirty jobs you did in the past.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Sheesh. I&#39;m quite astonished. To be honest, I am appalled.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Even though we are a Servant best suited for that kind of dirty work, Master has never once ordered us to do anything of the sort.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> And the fact that we know with certainty that Master would never issue such orders...</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Hmph. You are a strange, strange [\u2642 man /\u2640\uFE0F woman}, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You think so?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (Even though it&#39;s impossible to tell with that mask on...I have a feeling she&#39;s smiling as she says that. I can tell from her tone of voice.)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s like we just found a new friend here in Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We should introduce her to the other Hundred Personas, as well as to the other Servants. Oh, and we should give her a tour of Chaldea, too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um, Little Hassan. Is there anywhere you would like to go?</p><p><strong>Little Hassan:</strong> ... (Nod)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Where? I can take you anywhere. Please do not hesitate to ask!</p><p><strong>Little Hassan:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Little Hassan:</strong> Potty.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> !!!</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Ah! Okay! That&#39;s our first priority! But hold it a little longer, okay?</p><p><strong>Little Hassan:</strong> ... (Nod)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Asako...do you also specialize in babysitting?</p><hr>',392),a=[n];function h(g,i){return o(),s("div",null,a)}var d=e(r,[["render",h],["__file","Hassan of the Hundred Personas.html.vue"]]);export{d as default};
