But...</p><p>Is there something wrong with that warehouse?</p><p>Nothing, it&#39;s just weird to see people around there.</p><p>The Lost Room is there, after all.</p><p>Lost Room...?</p><p>It&#39;ll sound like a ghost story.</p><p>They say people disappear when they enter at midnight.</p><p>And this isn&#39;t an isolated incident, there are many reports about it.</p><p>Now it&#39;s no more than a warehouse, a forgotten relic from the previous Director&#39;s era.</p><p>You want to reorganize humanity based in the caste system?</p><p>I won&#39;t allow a society where my destiny is set in stone from the moment I was born!</p><p>Go, Berserker!</p><p>Director!</p><p>What did you expect?</p><p>Who do you think I am?</p><p>I&#39;m Chaldea&#39;s Director and owner of the Celestial Body Department in Clock Tower!</p><p>I&#39;m Olga Marie Animusphere!</p><p>If we talk about Master potential, you of all people shouldn&#39;t be that surprised!</p><p>Director, above!</p><p>Look above!</p><p>Heroic Spirits from the Age of Gods aren&#39;t needed anymore.</p><p>This planet now belongs to humanity.</p><p>It&#39;s too late for gods to claim ownership over it!</p><p>Archer! Caster!</p><p>Good grief, at this rate I&#39;ll have to take care of everything.</p><p>Mashu...? Fujimaru...?</p><p>Where did you go?</p><p>Perhaps I didn&#39;t do well as a Master?</p><p>Tell me! What does this mean!?</p><p>Was I asleep...?</p><p>It feels like I had a weird dream.</p><p>Can we continue now, Olga?</p><p>Lev...?</p><p>Y-Yeah... Go on.</p><p>What is it?</p><p>It&#39;s about the unknown location observed by CHALDEAS the other day, Director.</p><p>That was it.</p><p>It&#39;s an alarming situation indeed.</p><p>At this rate, it will become a Singularity disturbing human history.</p><p>I wonder if I should report this to the Association and the UN...</p><p>I believe it&#39;s too soon for that.</p><p>Maybe CHALDEAS isn&#39;t working properly.</p><p>It&#39;s been eleven years since it began operations in 2004.</p><p>How about trying a maintenance?</p><p>That won&#39;t do.</p><p>CHALDEAS is a pseudo-celestial body copying the Earth&#39;s soul.</p><p>Stopping CHALDEAS is the same as killing it.</p><p>To begin with, my CHALDEAS lacks any imperfection.</p><p>If it has a problem, the reason must be an external factor.</p><p>An external factor...</p><p>Then, if CHALDEAS isn&#39;t at fault, the issue must be in the Observation Lens SHEBA.</p><p>Oh? It would be my fault if that&#39;s the case.</p><p>It&#39;s true that my SHEBA has been working for 10 years.</p><p>Perhaps its theory isn&#39;t up to date.</p><p>I never said I had complaints towards you, Lev!</p><p>There&#39;s the possibility of the staff in the Control Room overlooking something...</p><p>...due to the Association harassing them all the time.</p><p>The staff is completely healthy.</p><p>If you ask me, the one who should take a day off is you, Director.</p><p>I agree.</p><p>You haven&#39;t been sleeping properly since we discovered this anomaly one week ago.</p><p>Let the doctors check your condition.</p><p>Aside from Leyshift experiment report, the report for the selection of Masters candidates is also finished.</p><p>So, please use the next twelve hours to rest as much as you can.</p><p>We don&#39;t have a replacemente for you, Director.</p><p>Alright, I&#39;ll take your advice.</p><p>Speaking of rest, proffesor Lev must be sleeping well.</p><p>I&#39;ve heard that going to bed and waking up early it&#39;s healthy.</p><p>That? Because my work was very exhausting before coming to Chaldea.</p><p>Once I completed SHEBA, I stopped seeing dreams.</p><p>That&#39;s why I can sleep soundly at night now.</p><p>What about you, Romani?</p><p>It&#39;s the opposite for me.</p><p>Since I came here, all I see are dreams.</p><p>But the dreams are always different.</p><p>The Organization for the Preservation of Human Order, Chaldea.</p><p>An organization established by my father in order to ensure the future.</p><p>The Animuspheres are a magi family that have studied the celestial bodies from long ago.</p><p>The mission of this family, of the Animuspheres, is to establish the thesis of the Grand Order.</p><p>That is, to guarantee the human history on this planet.</p><p>We see into the future to ensure that human history will continue beyond the present.</p><p>We don&#39;t aim for something big like &quot;creating the future.&quot;</p><p>Our mission is to guarantee that &quot;there is a future,&quot; and pass that onto other magi.</p><p>For that reason, the Animusphere created this Mystic Code.</p><p>Pseudo-Celestial Body, CHALDEAS.</p><p>Assuming the planet had a soul, we copied that soul and put it inside this model of the Earth.</p><p>But, we can&#39;t interfere with this second Earth.</p><p>That&#39;s because its phase it&#39;s different.</p><p>Still, it&#39;s possible to analyze it.</p><p>My father configured CHALDEAS one hundred years into the future.</p><p>As long as the light of civilization shines in CHALDEAS, we can assure the survival of humanity for the next one hundred years.</p><p>At the same time, CHALDEAS works as a library of Earth.</p><p>We can&#39;t observe in detail the future one hundred years ahead.</p><p>Because the future is always changing.</p><p>However, details of the confirmed past can be extracted.</p><p>It&#39;s a compass pointing towards the past of humanity, so to speak.</p><p>The success rate of sending someone to the past via Leyshifting after quantum decomposition...</p><p>...raises dramatically thanks to CHALDEAS.</p><p>My father founded Chaldea in order to observe and operate CHALDEAS.</p><p>He was a great researcher and a great magus.</p><p>That was my father... he left me alone after passing away three years ago.</p><p>His dead body was found in his office, back in 2012.</p><p>I don&#39;t even know if he had an accidental death or if he had an illness.</p><p>I was just a little girl who took over Chaldea after his death.</p><p>My father didn&#39;t leave me anything.</p><p>But I did receive his conviction as a magus of Animusphere.</p><p>It has been two years since I became Director.</p><p>And just when I thought I was finally starting to get things done...</p><p>But, why one hundred years into the future?</p><p>What do you mean, Mashu?</p><p>I mean, if the only thing that matters is to see that civilization continues, why not set it to one day or one year after?</p><p>It&#39;s about response time, Mashu.</p><p>If we set it to one day, there&#39;s nothing we can do if the light of civilization disappears.</p><p>There&#39;s no solution.</p><p>However, if the destruction comes one or ten years later, that&#39;s time enough to act.</p><p>I believe the previous Director set it in one hundred years to give humanity enough time to prepare.</p><p>I see now.</p><p>The previous Director thought things through.</p><p>B-But of course!</p><p>My father was a very prudent and thoughtful person!</p><p>He didn&#39;t act based on speculations nor wishful thinking.</p><p>That&#39;s true.</p><p>The Heroic Spirit Summoning System must be there for situations like that, too.</p><p>If an abnormality emerged in the past, it would be impossible for us in the present to fix it.</p><p>At least not if you don&#39;t go directly to that era to solve it.</p><p>Even if Leyshift succeeds, you can only send a magus by himself.</p><p>Once in that location, there&#39;s no weapons to rely on.</p><p>For that reason you need Heroic Spirits, the Servants.</p><p>Heroic Spirits exist as they&#39;re an extension of human history, in spite of how much it can change.</p><p>By borrowing their power, you can hold your ground in any era.</p><p>So, that&#39;s how it is.</p><p>Heroic Spirits are spiritual phenomenons of higher order.</p><p>The Throne of Heroes lies in a dimension above our own.</p><p>They&#39;re beings that transcend time.</p><p>Just like Chaldea, they&#39;re a security mechanism to protect The Human Order.</p><p>Because, as long as you make a contract with them, they can be summoned into any era.</p><p>The Heroic Spirit Summoning System isn&#39;t stable yet.</p><p>And first we must secure those Master candidates with high Leyshift aptitude.</p><p>I must make sure to verify that information...</p><p>I wish Da Vinci were more cooperative with our cause.</p><p>Olga, what about giving him...</p><p>I mean, her, a workshop?</p><p>Not yet.</p><p>I can&#39;t trust a Masterless Servant.</p><p>Besides, I can&#39;t deal with that Heroic Spirit.</p><p>Once we accomplish another summoning,</p><p>I&#39;ll have her leave immediately.</p><p>That&#39;s harsh.</p><p>I&#39;ve heard Da Vinci-chan sees you as her little sister.</p><p>We should leave Da Vinci in charge of the Heroic Spirit Summoning.</p><p>So we can focus in the Masters selection.</p><p>Olga, are you done choosing the A-Team?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>&quot;I recommend these seven magi if an emergency arises.&quot;</p><p>Those were the orders my father left.</p><p>Father ordered to call them Crypters instead of Master candidates.</p><p>Director...</p><p>What&#39;s this?</p><p>It doesn&#39;t seem like it was made here in Chaldea.</p><p>That...</p><p>How weird... it was supposed to be under strict security measures.</p><p>My apologies.</p><p>Is this something important?</p><p>Don&#39;t worry, we don&#39;t use it anymore.</p><p>It&#39;s one of the presents from the Atlas Institute.</p><p>The Atlas Institute?</p><p>The ones who provided the blueprint for the TRISMEGISTUS....</p><p>...resting at the core of Chaldea? Them?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>The place where the definitive weapons of the world of magecraft are stored.</p><p>The Pit of Taboo... The Atlas Institute.</p><p>My father had a deal with Atlas, and based on it, they had to provide us with technology.</p><p>That&#39;s how we got the Pseudo-Quantum Processor: TRISMEGISTUS.</p><p>The other one was that...</p><p>The Imaginary Numbers Observation System: PAPER MOON.</p><p>PAPER MOON...</p><p>A plane moon, perhaps?</p><p>It&#39;s my first time hearing of it.</p><p>So, what does it do?</p><p>It&#39;s a compass that allows you to demonstrate and observe the Imaginary Numbers realm.</p><p>It was prepared as a means to exceed CHALDEAS&#39; phase contrast.</p><p>Although, it isn&#39;t need anymore.</p><p>Because SHEBA was completed and we could accomplish Leyshifting.</p><p>I&#39;m surprised.</p><p>There is another way to interfere with Singularities besides Leyshifting?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>By diving into the realm of Imaginary Numbers to later resurface in the appointed location.</p><p>We called it Zero Sail.</p><p>And the ship that made that possible was the Shadow Border.</p><p>Keep the secret.</p><p>I get it.</p><p>There was a machine unused thanks to me finishing SHEBA.</p><p>You got me there.</p><p>I can&#39;t help but feel that I wasn&#39;t really needed.</p><p>Lev...?</p><p>It&#39;s just a thought.</p><p>Maybe it&#39;s a bit sudden, but that&#39;s how things are.</p><p>Let&#39;s say it took me by surprise.</p><p>Olga, I completed the Near-Future Observation Lens SHEBA back in 1999.</p><p>That&#39;s when I accepted Marisbilly&#39;s invitation.</p><p>My destiny was determined at that moment.</p><p>To save humanity...</p><p>No, that&#39;s wrong.</p><p>To make this planet a better place.</p><p>That became the goal of my life.</p><p>Before and after this incident.</p><p>The future that humans build is versatile and keeps changing.</p><p>That&#39;s why there&#39;s no stability.</p><p>Humanity&#39;s existence is wonderful, but they carry a big burden.</p><p>Wouldn&#39;t it be bad if it collapses like a mountain of pebbles?</p><p>That&#39;s exactly what I want to avoid.</p><p>I can&#39;t do much by myself.</p><p>But, at least I can stop one of those pebbles before crumbling.</p><p>What about you?</p><p>Do you want to be part of that big burden?</p><p>Do you want to carry that burden?</p><p>Or maybe you want to keep away those pebbles from your feet.</p><p>I...</p><p>I&#39;m none of that.</p><p>This big duty of preserving the Human Order only brings me anxiety.</p><p>I don&#39;t give a damn about the future and its importance.</p><p>All I have is this obsession to demonstrate that I&#39;m capable of doing it.</p><p>Everyday is painful...</p><p>Everyday, there&#39;s no future...</p><p>What will I do once the end comes...?</p><p>Is there a way for me to be happy...?</p><p>I don&#39;t know at all what my purpose should be...</p><p>This is so...</p><p>Oh, look at the time.</p><p>Pardon my discourtesy, but I&#39;ll be very busy from now on.</p><p>Are you Olga Marie?</p><p>My name is Lev Lainur, nice to meet you.</p><p>Oh? Without shaking hands?</p><p>It&#39;s fine, I like that attitude.</p><p>It takes time to trust others.</p><p>What? I dress weird?</p><p>It looks off?</p><p>But of course.</p><p>I&#39;m the only here who dresses old-fashioned.</p><p>It&#39;s my pride as a magus trying to display courtesy towards the history of the Animuspheres.</p><p>This may be a modern place, but it&#39;s also the workshop of the Animuspheres.</p><p>So, even if it&#39;s only me, it&#39;s natural to dress like a magus.</p><p>Okay.</p><p>Goodbye, Lev Lainur.</p><p>Good morning.</p><p>Are you in your break too, Senpai?</p><p>I see everybody was here.</p><p>I&#39;ll give you something to drink, what would you like?</p><p>Only tea.</p><p>Excuse me.</p><p>It&#39;s not like I&#39;m worried, but you look gloomy.</p><p>Is there something bothering you?</p><p>It&#39;s about my lack of skill.</p><p>That&#39;s obvious.</p><p>You were picked only to fill in numbers.</p><p>You aren&#39;t a magus nor a soldier.</p><p>Just an average joe.</p><p>I&#39;d have never given you the chance to fight if you weren&#39;t the last remaining candidate.</p><p>For you to receive such an important duty as protecting humanity&#39;s future is\u2013</p><p>Even so...</p><p>I can&#39;t keep getting saved by everyone else.</p><p>First, I must get things done by myself.</p><p>And I&#39;ve been working hard for it...</p><p>You...</p><p>The more time passes, the more I realise how ordinary I am...</p><p>It doesn&#39;t matter how much I train, or how many spells I learn...</p><p>From time to time, I ask myself...</p><p>&quot;Why me? I bet they have someone more qualified.&quot;</p><p>That kind of unpleasant thought.</p><p>Do you believe it was a mistake to become a Master?</p><p>You&#39;ve been doing it reluctantly because there&#39;s no one else to do it?</p><p>Good...</p><p>I should crush him now...</p><p>Anyways.</p><p>Those who don&#39;t even try are those who can&#39;t accomplish anything.</p><p>If you can&#39;t get out of the situation...</p><p>At least make yourself stronger.</p><p>Even as an ordinary person, I&#39;ll be useless if I at least don&#39;t show off my mediocrity.</p><p>I&#39;m not someone&#39;s substitute.</p><p>I want to meet everyone&#39;s expectations by being myself.</p><p>I&#39;m disappointed.</p><p>How can we trust the future of humanity to such weakling?</p><p>The restoration of Human Order went to your head.</p><p>Maybe my judgement was wrong.</p><p>Still, we made it this far thanks to you, Director.</p><p>We could complete Fuyuki&#39;s Order thanks to you.</p><p>We were able to eliminate the Singularities in France, Rome and Okeanos...</p><p>...because you were our navigator.</p><p>I did that with you...?</p><p>Mashu, what year is this...?</p><p>It&#39;s May 1st, 2016.</p><p>Director?</p><p>Are you feeling bad?</p><p>It&#39;s nothing.</p><p>Thanks, Mashu.</p><p>I regret not talking with you like this earlier.</p><p>Fujimaru.</p><p>Will you keep going in spite of your fear?</p><p>Well...</p><p>I&#39;m not discouraged enough as to give up.</p><p>Is that so?</p><p>There&#39;s nothing else for me to do, but I&#39;ll root for you anyways.</p><p>Even if your future gets replaced by something completely hopeless.</p><p>By the way...</p><p>Who was that?</p><p>She&#39;s nobody.</p><p>She&#39;s someone who couldn&#39;t reach this future.</p><p>Give up.</p><p>There&#39;s no Human Order to protect anymore.</p><p>Listen, drifter who came from a faraway future... no, from the correct history.</p><p>You can&#39;t win.</p><p>The human world will be destroyed.</p><p>The future has already been decided.</p><p>I knew of someone who said the same...</p><p>But, that was just an empty theory.</p><p>The future will always be a blank sheet as long as there&#39;s someone willing to fight!</p><p>I won&#39;t let that happen!</p><p>You&#39;re right.</p><p>Because the future literally became a blank sheet.</p><p>It would be better if there were something to incinerate, because at least there would be something.</p><p>But, this planet even let go of that residue.</p><p>Humanity is at a stalemate.</p><p>This is the future one year from now that was decided once you stopped the Incineration of the Human Order.</p><p>This is how planet Earth looks.</p><p>The King of Magecraft once said...</p><p>&quot;You would be happier by not doing anything.&quot;</p><p>Let me repeat those words again.</p><p>Our history shall not continue onto the future.</p><p>Because... we restored the Human Order...?</p><p>Wake up, Fujimaru.</p><p>Sorry! I overslept!</p><p>Huh...?</p><p>I only came to leave my stuff here and I fell asleep...</p><p>Even though the whole Chaldea staff is very busy cleaning things up...</p><p>Senpai!</p><p>I couldn&#39;t find you neither in your room nor in the cafeteria...</p><p>I was a bit worried.</p><p>Did you go to the warehouse?</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>I was sorting out the sheets and tablewares I used until now.</p><p>It doesn&#39;t feel right to just throw them away.</p><p>Isn&#39;t the new staff from the Association arriving soon?</p><p>Yes. They will arrive by helicopter once the weather allows it.</p><p>Their ship is anchored on the coast.</p><p>Really?</p><p>We went through a lot in one year, but it was worth it.</p><p>Thank you, Mashu.</p><p>Thank you for always supporting such a mediocre Master.</p><p>I... I should be the one saying it!</p><p>I&#39;m conscious I&#39;ve been supported many times and far longer than Senpai!</p><p>The objective of the inspection is obvious.</p><p>The old Chaldea will be disbanded and the staff will be renewed.</p><p>I wonder if I&#39;ll be able to be in the same department as you...</p><p>To begin with, will you stay at Chaldea!?</p><p>If you&#39;re going back to Japan, please give me your address!</p><p>I&#39;d like to send you a New Year&#39;s greeting card and the like...!</p><p>The Inspection Committee will arrive soon...</p><p>And with that, my unbelievable days at Chaldea will come to an end.</p><p>I don&#39;t know what will happen from now on.</p><p>It would make me happy to get a job at Chaldea, even if not as a Master.</p><p>Though, I know that won&#39;t be easy.</p><p>But, it doesn&#39;t matter what happens.</p><p>It doesn&#39;t matter how uncertain the future looks.</p><p>I believe there&#39;s nothing to be afraid of.</p><p>Humans are fundamentally powerless, and things rarely work out well.</p><p>Usually it&#39;s all in vain, and it&#39;s normal to just laugh it off saying something like...</p><p>&quot;Things like that happen, you know.&quot;</p><p>I know... that kind of strength was what helped me in this short yet long journey.</p><p>For the time being, there must still be things that only I can do.</p><p>Let&#39;s welcome the New Year without doubting that.</p>',402),i=[s];function n(r,h){return t(),o("div",null,i)}var u=e(p,[["render",n],["__file","Moonlight Lostroom.html.vue"]]);export{u as default};
