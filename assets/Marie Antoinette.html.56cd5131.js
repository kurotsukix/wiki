Is there a place we can go with more energy and people?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Of course! The Second Singularity, the repairing Rome!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> There shouldn&#39;t be any enemy Servants, so I can guide you there safely!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh? S-Senpai, the Doctor&#39;s saying that\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Can&#39;t hurt, can it?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> R-Really? ...I guess you&#39;re right.

I&#39;ll get the Rayshift system ready right away!</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> My, what a wonderful place\u2013</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> So this is the ancient Roman Empire, the land that all the nobles of Europe dreamed of.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> The buildings are splendid, and there&#39;re so many people! And look at all these smiles!</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> This is a great place! Thank you for bringing me here, Doctor\u266A</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Not at all. Anything for you, Queen Marie. But there was one mistake I made...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> You need an operator to perform the Rayshift, which means I have to stay behind...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...This is the biggest mistake of my life.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fou-fou\u266A</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The wars have ended and everyone&#39;s full of energy. I&#39;m glad\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I wonder if Nero&#39;s doing okay.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m sure she is. Not knowing history, just knowing her.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s how it seems to me. But I know she&#39;s got a lot of trouble ahead...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Should we...not say hello?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No. Rome&#39;s being restored, so Nero may have no memories of us.</p><hr><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Oh?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou?</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Oh? Oh? I see a splendid palace over there.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> It&#39;s different than the ones in my era. The town and palace are both different.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> I&#39;d like to see what&#39;s inside. Heheh, let&#39;s go take a look!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fooou\u266A</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Come along, Fou. Let&#39;s take a tour inside that palace\u266A</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Um, um, Senpai? Marie is heading further and further away. Let&#39;s go after her!</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Hmm, so this is how it looks. It looks elegant, but it&#39;s also sturdy and strong.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> I feel strength within the beauty. Perhaps it comes from the trust and pride toward this country&#39;s culture.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> W-We finally caught up... I can&#39;t believe she just walked right inside the palace.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> As expected of the French Queen.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Amazing, huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes... She passed by the palace guards with just a smile...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> She has a noble aura, you could say. Like she belongs in any palace.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Her words, her expression, even her smallest movements, they&#39;re all so noble that even I might...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> If I were a palace guard, I might let her in too.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> She truly is the last queen of France\u2013 Amazing...just amazing...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I wish I could have seen her walking through the real Versailles Palace, and smiling by the fountains...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> If one of the singularities turns out to be 18th century France, maybe I&#39;ll get the chance...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> But sadly, the Rayshift system won&#39;t let us travel to any location except the singularities.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> If only all the other eras hadn&#39;t been incinerated...sob...</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Huh? What&#39;s this over here?</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Is it a throne? An ancient Roman throne! How wonderful!</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Come here, Fou. We&#39;ll look at it together!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, foou\u266A</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> She ran off again!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Let&#39;s follow her, Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Right, Senpai! We&#39;ll follow her! Oh, she&#39;s surprisingly fast!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> ...?</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> (Grin Grin)</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> And you are...?</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> (Grin Grin)</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Umu. Are you a foreign royal? I sense an intense royal aura about you, though it does not rival my own.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> For you to come before my throne, you must be. Umu, I shall allow it.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> But where are you from? Seneca said nothing about an audience...</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Nice to meet you, Emperor. I am Marie.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Umu. I am Emperor Nero Claudius.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (Oops! We ran into Nero!)</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> (Marie the White Lily Queen, and Nero the Rose Emperor! What a picture! Save an image, Mash!)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (R-Right now is not the time!)</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Um, I have a favor to ask of you. May I speak?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> What royal family are you from, again...? Hmm? What do you wish to ask of me?</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> That throne\u2013</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> I&#39;d like to sit on the throne of the ancient Roman emperors!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou\u266A</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Wha\u2013</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Y-You say you want my throne? Does that mean\u2013you want to become Emperor?</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> ?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> I don&#39;t know what family you&#39;re from, but you are indeed a bold rebel!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Very well! I see I must show you what I&#39;m capable of!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> I shall allow it! Pick up your sword! If you truly want the throne, seize it by force!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> We emperors have ruled Rome since the time of Romulus! You who oppose us, behold the might of the Emperor!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> W-Wait, Nero\u2013 Um, we&#39;re not here to fight!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (And Nero is a human from this time period! There&#39;s no way she can fight a Servant!)</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Hmm? Have I met you\u2013 somewhere before?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Huh\u2013Oh, right. The era is repairing itself, and she&#39;s started to forget about us, maybe.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> No, I remember your name at least. Mash and Fujimaru, was it?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Huh? She remembers and forgets? Maybe she&#39;ll remember tomorrow?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> You&#39;re with Marie, then? Very well! I&#39;ll fight you too!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Oddly, the headache I&#39;ve had all day is gone! No one stands a chance against me at full power!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Wait\u2013 Huh? What...What&#39;s this...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What&#39;s wrong?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Mash?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m sensing powerful magical energy from Nero! She wasn&#39;t a mage in life, though!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> H-Huh? I&#39;m picking it up here too! What is this? It&#39;s Servant-class!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> What&#39;s going on!?</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Uh...? Huh? What is it?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Ah! Queen Marie has no idea what&#39;s happening! We&#39;re about to start a duel with Emperor Nero!</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Oh, I see\u2013 Good luck and do your best, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You&#39;re just making us do it?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Let&#39;s begin! May the thunderous applause echo here!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> There&#39;s no stopping her now! Commencing battle\u2013!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...S-She&#39;s strong. How can the human Nero be so strong?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Where is all this energy coming from? Did something happen to Emperor Nero?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> I&#39;m feeling great today! I feel like I could expand our borders tomorrow!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Marie, was it? I can&#39;t give you the throne, but that was splendid.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> I love your beauty. You have the purity that&#39;s lacking in Rome. It would be a shame to pluck such a pretty flower.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> You can sit on the throne a little later when no one is here. Tonight, we&#39;ll have a banquet!</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> I&#39;m honored, Emperor! Right, Fou?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fou\u266A</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Fou really likes her... A-Anyway, I&#39;m glad neither of them died.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...They&#39;re friends now, too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s right.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> We&#39;re gonna eat tonight!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We did use a ton of magical energy. I want you to fill yourself up, Senpai.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;m so jealous... You guys get to join a banquet, and all I get to do is watch...</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Hehe, we&#39;ll bring back presents, so don&#39;t be sad Doctor.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Queen Marie! Oh, Vive La France!</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Vive La France\u266A</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou fou-foou\u266A</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Vive La Fra\u2013nce! Marie!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Hmm? What&#39;s this? I don&#39;t know, but I&#39;ll join in! Vive La Rome!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou fou-foou\u266A</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><h2 id="the-fragile-lily" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-fragile-lily" aria-hidden="true">#</a> The Fragile Lily</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Where...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Where is this place? I think I was resting at Chaldea...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I was trying to... sleep in my room, I think...</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> \u2013That&#39;s right. You were all asleep.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So sleepy...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Huh? Marie?</p><hr><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> You&#39;re both awake, then. Good morning\u266A</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> However, you both are actually still asleep. So am I, more precisely.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Your bodies are dreaming, but your minds are with me.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> So you can&#39;t hear the Doctor here. You can&#39;t contact Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> You understand what I&#39;m saying now, don&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We&#39;re dreaming...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The records say that a Servant and Master can share memories in their dreams.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But this... For us to recognize each other\u2013</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> It&#39;s because Chaldea&#39;s summoning system is slightly different than normal summons.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> That&#39;s what happened. Or perhaps,</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> &quot;You&quot; are the only one dreaming, and the others are just characters in your dreams.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Which means\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ???</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The dream of the butterfly, right?</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> I wonder. Who&#39;s the dreamer, and who&#39;s the dream?</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> But there&#39;s one thing I do know. Especially for me.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> This is... The place I must walk.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The place you must walk...</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> This is my Temple. Not the real one, of course.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The Tour du Temple\u2013 The place where Marie Antoinette awaited execution.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Then this is your mental landscape? This space, no, this place.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> That&#39;s what it looks like to me. How does it look to you?</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> If my memories are reaching you, then it must look the same to you. Otherwise, perhaps you&#39;re seeing</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> the closest place to it in your own memories. Heheh, don&#39;t get scared, okay?</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> It&#39;s all right. I&#39;ll be sure to lead you to the exit.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That means we need to find a way to escape, doesn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Yes. \u2013I&#39;m sorry.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> These are my memories. What was once in my heart. A world where I waited for death, with no escape.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> But you two are different. And so I can get you out.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Let&#39;s escape.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Let&#39;s go together.</p><hr><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> ...Yes.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Come, let&#39;s go. To the outside. To your real world.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...It&#39;s a labyrinth, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But I don&#39;t really feel lost. Is this your doing?</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Yes. Because you two are here.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> I don&#39;t know if I could escape on my own. These are my memories of sorrow and misery.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> But you are here for me. I&#39;m connected to you as a Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> And so I won&#39;t lose my way. I&#39;ll make it to the exit\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Wait. Multiple presences detected ahead.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Magical energy responses? Wait, these aren&#39;t from living creatures.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Though I don&#39;t know if you can feel magical energy in a dream.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> This is what I once felt. It&#39;s fear, death, and of course, sadness.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> ...It&#39;s all right. We can win.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Get ready, Mash.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Let&#39;s break through.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, Master. \u2013Moving to engage enemies!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...We defeated them!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Good thing the summoning system was working. It must be because it&#39;s linked to your existence.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Whew! We made it. There&#39;s no way that we&#39;ll lose.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> I was sad when I was here, but I never gave in to despair.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Even if I died, even if my husband the King died, even if my beloved children died...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Marie\u2013</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Even if the people forget the royal family&#39;s white lilies, France will be eternal.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> That&#39;s what I believed. I believed that this was necessary for France.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> That&#39;s why &quot;giving up&quot; is the one thing I didn&#39;t do.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> It may change form, but France is eternal. The white lilies of glory shall never fade.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Vive La France! Glory to our nation, France!</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette?:</strong> ...What a joke.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette?:</strong> That&#39;s nothing but self-deception. The foolish lies of a foolish queen, killed by her foolish people.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette?:</strong> The man you loved was killed. Your children were killed. And yet, Vive La France? Really?</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette?:</strong> You&#39;re a liar. Tell them what you really think, why don&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette?:</strong> You want France, and its foolish people who trampled on your royal white lilies, to die.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This is... A Servant? No\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Another Marie?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> A Shadow Servant?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The presence is almost identical. If this is really a dream, then...</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Yes, Mash is right.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Both of us are real. Both of us are me.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> I am the &quot;Marie&quot; who never gave up. She is the &quot;Marie&quot; that did.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> I am the &quot;Marie&quot; who decided to regret nothing. She is the &quot;Marie&quot; who sorrows, rages, and curses.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Both of us...are me. Neither is a fake.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette?:</strong> No, no. You&#39;re a fake, Marie.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette?:</strong> I&#39;m the real Marie Antoinette. A foolish queen who broke her heart trying to save her people, and was betrayed!</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette?:</strong> My curse upon France! May it suffer a millennia of starvation and war!</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette?:</strong> May it be crushed\u2013 Under the wheels of endless revolution!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Maybe it&#39;s because this place is special, but I can feel her rage.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s a burning torrent of emotion, as sharp as a knife.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> She carried this inside of her... And she still always smiled at us\u2013</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Pathetic, aren&#39;t &quot;I?&quot; How could I forget smiles and love?</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> No matter how much I am hurt, or hated, I can never stop smiling.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Shouldn&#39;t that be the duty of a Queen? No matter what my end was\u2013</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Say, why don&#39;t we stay dazzling? Let&#39;s smile at everyone, every nation, and the world.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> That is the &quot;Marie&quot; who decided to leave her mother and become the White Lily of France.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> That&#39;s why... I will not accept you.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette?:</strong> How dare you, Marie Antoinette! In that case, I will make you succumb to me, and I shall rise!</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette?:</strong> They want to incinerate the world? Fine! Let them!</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette?:</strong> The people, the country, the world that stole my life and the lives of the people I loved!</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette?:</strong> Let it all be destroyed, with no records or memories left! The guillotine is too good for it!</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> \u2013I can&#39;t bear to listen to this anymore.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Your cries are my cries, but I don&#39;t want to hear them.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> ...Come Fujimaru. Tell me what to do, my &quot;Master.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> We&#39;re leaving this place!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...Defeat her and press on!</p><hr><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Oui. \u2013Let&#39;s do this, Mash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Right, Marie!

After the way you were betrayed.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette?:</strong> And you&#39;re still smiling? I see...</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette?:</strong> ...That&#39;s really who I am, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette?:</strong> Vive La France. The exit is just up ahead...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...The enemy Servant has vanished. The battle has ended.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Thank you, both of you. Sorry to get you caught up in this.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> But I feel just a little better. You got the chance to see me do something besides smile.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Now I have nothing left to keep from you.
