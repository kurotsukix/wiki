Master! We&#39;re gonna go on an adventure!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...? Astolfo? Where are you going?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> To France! I thought I&#39;d pay Roland a visit.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Um. I don&#39;t think Roland is around in 1431...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> It&#39;s okay! All we gotta do is wander around France, and I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll get summoned one of these days!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Now let&#39;s go, go, go!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> H-hey, don&#39;t be so pushy!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Here...we...goooooo!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai...Senpaaai!!!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Sorry! I&#39;m lost!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Called it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I kinda figured.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master. If you knew this would happen, you should have said something earlier.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I guess there&#39;s nothing to be done now. Fortunately, you have camping supplies, so I suggest you spend the night in the forest.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Yay!!! Camping! Camping! Hey, do you have curry?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Curry! Curry!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Um, if you&#39;re a Servant, you don&#39;t need to eat...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Ehhh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s fine. Here you go.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Let&#39;s eat together.</p><hr><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Yay! Thank you Master! Then make mine an extra large curry!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> More! Mooore!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Here you go.</p><hr><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Thanks!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I think you&#39;re spoiling Astolfo too much, Senpai.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You think so?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I do.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Then I&#39;ll spoil you when we get back, Mash!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Eh? Me!? Um...well...no...you mustn&#39;t...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um, but if you insist, I shall gratefully...</p><hr><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Master, Master! More!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Again!?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Whew! I ate a lot! I&#39;m stuffed!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master. You are out of emergency rations. You&#39;ll need to purchase food in town tomorrow...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Okay, then I&#39;m going to sleep to prepare for tomorrow. Good night!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> ...Zzzzzz.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That was fast, Master. Astolfo just fell asleep in the middle of a sentence.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Just like a child.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Some kids act like that.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Is that true? I&#39;ve never met any children like that in Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, but I remembered something. It was when I first met you, Senpai...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Ahhh! What a refreshing morning! ...Huh? What&#39;s wrong?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> N-nothing. I just didn&#39;t get enough sleep. It&#39;s okay. It shouldn&#39;t affect us in combat.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Ahaha. Master, you look sleepy too. Well, let&#39;s head off!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Where could Roland be?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> In conditions like this, I sincerely doubt a Servant could be summoned easily...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> I guess so...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Is Roland your lover?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Is Roland your boyfriend?</p><hr><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Roland? Hahahaha! That&#39;s a riot!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> That guy...he&#39;s no good, Master. He&#39;s good-looking, but he&#39;s bad inside.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> ...No. That&#39;s not the word. He&#39;s not bad on the inside. Hmmm... To put it in today&#39;s terms, he&#39;s...disappointing?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> No matter how good someone looks, you&#39;d still kinda judge &#39;em if they ran around town naked, right?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Roland does that! Happily, even! It&#39;s practically a hobby! He&#39;ll just run around buck naked!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> That&#39;s just the kinda guy he is, so prolly not really \u201Clover\u201D material, y&#39;know?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...It&#39;s true. According to legend, Roland stripped his clothes off, mad with grief.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But I didn&#39;t think he really ran around...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Ayup. That&#39;s cause after that, he&#39;d get naked every chance he had. Said he got hooked on it. Hooked!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Stripping?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Hooked?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (Did he have a mental breakdown...?)</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Anyway, let&#39;s go look for some enemies. My Astolfo-sense is telling me that fort looks suspicious!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh... Astolfo is always so pushy...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But if Roland ever joined us, I feel he would be a great asset. Let&#39;s do our best to find him.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Yep! He&#39;d for sure be dependable, you&#39;ve got the Astolfo guarantee on that! Other stuff...not so much.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It seems like Fou is also concerned...or at least that&#39;s what I&#39;m getting from that response.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> By the way, I&#39;m curious about something. Hey, Mash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes? What is it?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Are you okay seeing naked men?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> !</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I-I-I-I...I suppose. I&#39;ve never seen one, but I should be okay...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I-it is through the filter of a screen, too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I-I-I-I think it should be okay. Yes. It&#39;ll be fine. I have a little knowledge about those things.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;ll be fine. I&#39;ll be ready. As long as you let me mentally prepare, it&#39;ll be totally fine.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Oh, good!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. Please rest assured...somewhat.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> ...Master. I&#39;m betting Mash will scream. What about you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m all in for screaming.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> There&#39;s nothing to bet on.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I-I&#39;ll be fine! Totally! I&#39;ll definitely probably be okay!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> We&#39;ve arrived! Hey, you guys there.</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> ...Hm? What?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> You&#39;re looking kinda tired. Everything okay?</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> ...It&#39;s complicated. This old man is considering quitting the soldiering life and go home...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Really? Then, good work! Hey by the way, did you see a naked handsome guy running around?</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> ...A naked...handsome guy?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Yep!</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> A guy with a bright smile, but he looks a bit dumb, but at the same is stupid strong...that handsome guy?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Yep, that&#39;s the one. We&#39;re looking for him!</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> I see...you&#39;re looking for him? I see, I see. Hey, everyone!</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> Some friends of that naked jackass are here! Get &#39;em!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Eh...eh!? Wh-what, why!?</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> No questions asked! Cock-a-doodle-doo! Arrrf! Wooof!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What exactly happened to anger those men so much!? What did this Roland do!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A-anyway, Astolfo! We need to calm them down!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> I know, I know! I&#39;ll give &#39;em what for and that&#39;ll calm &#39;em right down! Astolfo PUNCH!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Well...um, I can&#39;t argue with that... Anyway, please strike with the flat of the blade, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> Why you...I curse you for the nakedness...ungh.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Whew. I worked up a good sweat.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Mine was cold sweat...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Um, the first guys...yeah, this guy! Hey! Are you okay?</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> Y-yeah... (Gasp) Wh-who the hell are you guys? And why&#39;re you so strong?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> So tell me. Roland...I mean the naked guy...do you know where he is?</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> He ran wild in that fort and then disappeared... All we wanted to do was to put clothes on him...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> That is...I can only say I&#39;m sorry. I am pretty sure he didn&#39;t not mean to do any harm.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You need to find him, Astolfo.</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> Oh, and when he jumped up, he pressed his crotch on my face... I&#39;m scarred...forever...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Hey! You gotta say stuff like that earlier! I put my face right next to yours!!!</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> Terrible...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Don&#39;t cry! Now I&#39;m getting sad, too!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Wanna go home?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Let&#39;s retreat.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> N-no. If Roland is out there, running amok, then that&#39;s a problem we need to fix.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Let&#39;s at least resolve this problem.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Y-yeah. I&#39;ll do my best! So please don&#39;t abandon me, Master!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Hmmm...I haven&#39;t heard any screams...yet.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m worried about how all these citizens have this thousand yard stare...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> They all look like they saw something no one should ever see.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> I&#39;m sure it&#39;s just a Demon King or something. Probably. Let&#39;s ask around.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I have a bad feeling about this...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Hey, soldier. Mind answering a question? See a naked guy running around the streets here?</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> ...Naked. Guy. This. Road. Straight. Go.</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> I. Lead. Way. Follow. Me.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Really? Yay, a clue! Let&#39;s go, Master!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Aren&#39;t you the least bit suspicious about what that man said!? W-wait just a moment!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Hm. Hey soldier. Where&#39;s the naked guy?</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> You. Friends. That. Guy.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> N-no, that&#39;s not...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Um, technically I am.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Fou!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m sorry! I couldn&#39;t help it! It just slipped out! Fou, I&#39;m sorry!</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> Fufufu. This. Grudge. Must. Not. Ignore.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Uwaa! They&#39;re attacking! What the heck? We were tricked!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Not tricked, really. I knew they would attack. Of course they would!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Whew. We beat them. They were so pale, I thought they were zombies!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> They seemed that way because of those dead fish eyes of theirs...</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> Ungh... So what the heck was he...?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> What did he do to you guys?</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> I scolded him because he was naked. Then he got violent...</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> He even climbed onto the two hundred year old statue of our town&#39;s saint...and he mounted his head...</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> And he shouted \u201CI&#39;m the king of the world!!!\u201D</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> The rest...was all a mess. Then he ran off, laughing.</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> The kids cried...the women blushed but stared...I&#39;m starting to get really tired of living a proper life.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Please get a hold of yourself. It&#39;s okay. Please live a proper life!</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> You think so? I feel like I&#39;m in an illusion and hallucination at the same time...</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> See? There&#39;s a little girl up ahead...</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> Oh, so it was an illusion.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Aw, c&#39;mon. A little hallucination now and then is no big deal! People get to keep on having fun after they lose their sense of reason, too!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We absolutely need to stop this rampage!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Astolfo, we need to stop the perv\u2013I mean, Roland!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Got it! ...Wait a minute. I thought the plan was to get him to join us?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Oh well!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s not good.</p><hr><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> He came through the city. Where could he have gone?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Oh, footprints!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;ll analyze them.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The print isn&#39;t from a shoe. It&#39;s from a bare foot.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...There&#39;s only one person crazy enough to walk a wasteland barefoot...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Roland! Okay! Let&#39;s get to trackin&#39;!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> I feel like we&#39;re playing a game of boy scouts! If Geronimo was here, he&#39;d give us some big fancy lecture about tracking and the land or...something...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> &#39;Course, then I&#39;d forget it about a minute later!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> The footprints continue this way... This way... Turn this way... He climbed a tree...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Stole a bird egg... Ate it...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Ouch! I-I won&#39;t steal, okay!?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Afterward, he wasn&#39;t satisfied with just one egg... He wandered around...fought a wyvern..</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Then ate it...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> He ate it!?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Raw, too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Raw!?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> And then afterward, he got food poisoning from eating the raw wyvern, and he threw up right here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master! This is not encouraging!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Just a little bit further...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Y-yes. As your navigator, I&#39;ll stick with you till the very end!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Keep at it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh...Master&#39;s getting discouraged too. A little more...let&#39;s stick to it a little bit more...!</p><hr><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> So...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Theeen he stepped all over his own vomit, then he staggered along...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> And then he went to sleep sulking for just a bit. Hey, do you think it feels nice, sleeping naked on the ground like that?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This is like a strange geoglyph, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> But then...a wild horse came rushing toward him from the side...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> And it kicked Roland&#39;s back. Oh, his mouth&#39;s bleeding a little.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I have no more energy to comment on this. Master, I leave the rest to you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I don&#39;t want to do that!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I thought you were supposed to play the straight man!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> And then Roland stood up. He called for the horse&#39;s owner!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> And then he got into an argument. Roland was so angry...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> He choked the owner and tossed him under this tree...</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> H-how irrational...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yet another victim.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> And then Roland mounted the horse... Everything was going fine for a while...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> But then he realized that riding a horse naked and bareback causes various areas to start hurting...and so he dismounted.</p><p><strong>H\uFF1AHorse:</strong> Neeeighhh. Brrrgh.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So it really does hurt?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Why not try it yourself? Naked.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Absolutely not.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> A shame. By the way, mister horse, do you know where the naked guy who rode you went?</p><p><strong>H\uFF1AHorse:</strong> Neeeigh!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> He said, \u201CFollow me.\u201D</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So we&#39;re finally going to meet him. Hnnn...my body&#39;s trembling...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> ...There! There he is!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> I finally found you, Roland!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master, I&#39;m starting to get embarrassed! I&#39;m not fine!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> O-ooohhh...you are...are you by chance Astolfo?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, oh! Clothes! He&#39;s wearing clothes! I&#39;m so relieved!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Yeah...yeah it&#39;s me, Roland! I&#39;m glad! I&#39;m glad I could pick you out because you&#39;re wearing clothes!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> If you were naked, I probably wouldn&#39;t have recognized your face!</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong> Th-that cheerfully dumb child... You really are Astolfo!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Hey, it&#39;s been a while. How&#39;ve you been?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Oh, let me introduce you! This is my Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Hello...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I heard so much about you from Astolfo.</p><hr><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> And this is Master&#39;s other Servant...she&#39;s a navigator for us now. Her name&#39;s Mash!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m Mash Kyrielight. I serve as a navigator for Master in Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> P-pleased to meet you.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master, Master. He&#39;s looking at me. He&#39;s...really staring!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> B-be patient.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It&#39;ll be okay.</p><hr><p><strong>Roland:</strong> You said your name is Mash Kyrielight.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Y-yes.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong> What a beautiful name... Fitting for someone as beautiful as you...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Eh, um...thank you very much.</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong> The moon out tonight is...beautiful...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> !?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Eh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Wh-what was that?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Could it be...?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I-I-I-I have no idea!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m not sure if those were romantic words or...I really don&#39;t have any experience with that!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Roland&#39;s waiting for a response. He&#39;s even prostrating himself!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Beautiful...what a beautiful way he bows...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Mash. The gentleman is waiting. Answer him.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> M-my apologies... I&#39;m very sorry, but...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Men who like to be naked...are not really my...</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Oh, he stood up. Hey, don&#39;t get discouraged just because you got rejected by a girl!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Although...people fall for me all the time so I&#39;ve never been rejected!</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong> WHAAAAAA...!??</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong> If that&#39;s...how it is...then let&#39;s all die together!!! Together!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Eh, together!?</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong> Yes! This will be like Romeo and Juliet! Oh Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Wrong role!</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong> Now, if you can hand me my Juliet, Master Romeo!</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong> Fufu...fufufu...fuhahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master! He is not Roland!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> To be clear, he&#39;s just lingering emotions Roland left behind...a remnant...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Anyway, he&#39;s a fake! That&#39;s such a relief!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Hmmm, so we&#39;re gonna have to fight, huh? Well, if he&#39;s a fake, it can&#39;t be helped! (Nobbu!)</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Okay, Master! I&#39;m going to win...for Mash&#39;s sake!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Got it. Don&#39;t leave anything behind.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Let&#39;s do it. It&#39;s going to regret ever being born.</p><hr><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Okay. I&#39;m gonna pull out all the stops!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Come on, Hippogriff! Master&#39;s cheering you on! Let&#39;s give it our all!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m counting on you, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Roland-ish Thing:</strong> Regret...! Nothing but regret!!!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Roland...</p><p><strong>Roland-ish Thing:</strong> Unnnnggh... At least...before I die...I wanted to...</p><p><strong>Roland-ish Thing:</strong> ...Expose everything...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Even his evil ghost is saying that!? THAT&#39;S your last wish!? Ahahaha! And that&#39;s why Roland&#39;s hilarious!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> I bet even our king would laugh himself silly if he saw you!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> By king, you mean...?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Charlemagne, of course! Now that I think about it... I wonder why he hasn&#39;t been summoned yet either...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Me, Roland, the king... One day I&#39;d like to fight alongside them!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Okay! Anyway, we saw Roland! Kinda! And once he gets summoned properly, we can see him again!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> But my Astolfo sense tells me that if we meet, it&#39;ll be in a REALLY dumb situation!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Sorry for all the hassle, Master. Now, let&#39;s go home!</p>',329),a=[r];function g(h,p){return t(),s("div",null,a)}var i=o(n,[["render",g],["__file","Astolfo.html.vue"]]);export{i as default};
