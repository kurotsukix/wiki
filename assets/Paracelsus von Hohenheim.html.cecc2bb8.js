He was one of the masterminds behind Project Demonic Fog...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...but now he&#39;s one of our allies. A miracle of the Heroic Spirit summoning system, I suppose.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> But I admit I was startled when he said that he wanted to go to &quot;the London of that era.&quot;</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> That&#39;s understandable. I attempted to commit vile crimes against the world and its people.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> It&#39;s logical for you to doubt me. However\u2013</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> I truly do not wish for the human world to be destroyed. Thus, I sympathize with your goals and objectives.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> Now I believe that it&#39;s possible to save all of my beloved children.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> ...My former self running that Project may have laughed in contempt at such a notion.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> But now... Now that I&#39;ve entered into a contract with Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> I have faith once again. In people. In the world.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> ...In the existence of allies of justice capable of fighting evil.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Allies of justice\u2013</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> That is none other than all of you. You defeated me as I reached out to the Project at the edge of despair.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> Allow me to say the following with the deepest gratitude.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> Thank you. I beg you to show me your power once more.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It depends on the situation. Mr. Paracelsus.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You mentioned unusual changes occurring in London as it corrects itself\u2013that is what you claim?</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What do you mean by &quot;unusual changes?&quot; The Demonic Fog is gradually dissipating.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> As the era is corrected, London should return to normal without having to wait for the Demonic Fog to clear up.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> And yet, you seem to be agitated.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Why is that\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> He senses something?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> He knows something?</p><hr><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> To Master&#39;s query, all I can say is this. Yes and no.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> It&#39;s true that I sense some kind of connection. But I also know that there&#39;s something in this place.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> Namely\u2013</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> Never mind. Let us speak later. Something remaining in the Demonic Fog approaches.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> He&#39;s right! Multiple magical energy readings detected in the fog!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> They&#39;re likely the automatas! They&#39;re bursting with magical energy, so be careful!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Understood. Senpai, give us orders!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Prepare for battle!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Destroy the enemy while maintaining a barrier!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, Master! \u2013Preparing for battle!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ending combat. All enemies destroyed.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> ...Very impressive, Master.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> Let us be off then. I must show you firsthand what I know.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> There&#39;s an underground space under the southern tip of Regent&#39;s Park...</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> It&#39;s part of the underground facility for the Mage&#39;s Association Or rather, for Clock Tower.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> You could say it&#39;s one of their quarantine areas. There&#39;s something here that has been sealed.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Something?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Stuff like...dangerous magical tomes, Mystic Codes, and catalysts?</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> Magical tomes\u2013 This is basically what I&#39;m referring to.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> In particular, there&#39;s one tome that was used to seal a powerful evil that almost manifested itself in this world.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> That tome, along with many other magical books, was carefully sealed with powerful spells.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> Even the spread of the Demonic Fog could not weaken the seals placed on the tomes.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> Just like other dangerous things that were sealed. However...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You believe that these seals have been broken, correct?</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> Yes.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Your reasoning?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You seem quite certain.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, Senpai. I&#39;m also bothered by his self-assurance.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> ...It&#39;s simple.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> The reason is that if I existed in this London and continued to pursue my designs\u2013</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> \u2013I would break the seals without fail.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...What!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Huh!? Does that mean you&#39;re going to break the seals now!?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Foou!</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> No. I&#39;m not the one who will break the seals. It will be the one still here\u2013</p><p><strong>???:</strong> \u2013To be more precise, the &quot;me&quot; from here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This voice\u2013 Wait, I&#39;ve detected a new Servant!</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> Show yourself. Loather and mourner of evil, and yet is evil himself.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> You who would crush all life with the very hands that would hold your dear children... You abomination.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> I am thou... Thou art I. Thy name is my name\u2013</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> Paracelsus von Hohenheim! The consort of evil!</p><p><strong>Paracelsus?:</strong> ...Oh dear. What an unfriendly way to address yourself.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> !?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> There are two Paracelsuses?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Which one is the real one?!</p><hr><p><strong>Paracelsus?:</strong> How easy it is to confuse you. But I shall speak only the truth.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus?:</strong> We are both real. I am thou... Thou art I.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus?:</strong> The Servant Paracelsus beside you whom you duly summoned and made a contract with.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus?:</strong> And I, born of Servant Paracelsus&#39; magical energy that returned to the fog when you defeated him.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus?:</strong> Both share the name &quot;von Hohenheim.&quot; Both are real.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus?:</strong> Admittedly, my existence is somewhat unstable.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus?:</strong> For the Holy Grail is already gone! Materialization while lacking ways to summon Heroic Spirits!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...He seems to be right. Observational results show that his magical energy is weak.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The Demonic Fog... Has given birth to a final Heroic Spirit?</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> Yes, exactly. That&#39;s why I&#39;m in a hurry. In a hurry to destroy this era.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> At this rate, this era will be completely restored. If so, I cannot destroy it with my own hands.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> My existence will likely disappear. However, I can&#39;t let that happen.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> I have accepted the destruction of humanity as fate. One cannot stop it. Thus\u2013</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> \u2013I have no choice but to go through with this!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><span style="font-size:25px;">GAAAAAAAA\u2013!</span></p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> What!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Massive magical response! There&#39;s something\u2013behind him!</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> It seems the seal has been broken. It seems my other self is quite efficient.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> No time to praise yourself!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> How do you repair the seal?</p><hr><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> We must make haste. We must destroy it before it fully activates.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> If what was sealed materializes, the Sixth Imaginary Factor\u2013No\u2013</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> \u2013We must destroy it. Along with my other self barring the way!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Senpai!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Prepare for battle!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Let&#39;s do this, Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, Master! Preparing for and entering battle immediately\u2013!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Large-type enemy, destroyed!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What a powerful enemy... But somehow we managed to win...</p><p><strong>Paracelsus?:</strong> How disappointing\u2013</p><p><strong>Paracelsus?:</strong> That is all I can say to you after giving up. For the world will be incinerated.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> No. You are wrong.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> That is what I can say, as I will not give up. I know the world will be saved.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus?:</strong> ...Hah. How absurd. To think that &quot;I&quot;...</p><p><strong>Paracelsus?:</strong> ...the one who continued to choose evil despite having no desire to, would be punished...</p><p><strong>Paracelsus?:</strong> ...by my own hand...</p><p><strong>Paracelsus?:</strong> Ah... The end of this pathetic, ugly self...</p><p><strong>Paracelsus?:</strong> This, I offer to you...Misaya...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The enemy Servant has gone completely silent. ...Ending combat.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Foou!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> What a terrifying opponent to face... Well, we are in the heart of the Mage Association&#39;s lair.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It was as fearsome as Fafnir. It&#39;s a matter of luck that we pulled through.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> That&#39;s not true\u2013</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> You are all capable of victory. Even if it were to awaken once again.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> What?</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> You are a bulwark against evil. You are truly the allies of justice that I believe in.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> Thus, no matter what fearsome opponents you may face...</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> ...no matter what betrayals you face, no matter the depths of despair you witness...</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> It is impossible for you to lose\u2013</p>',144),n=[a];function g(i,h){return e(),t("div",null,n)}var l=s(r,[["render",g],["__file","Paracelsus von Hohenheim.html.vue"]]);export{l as default};
