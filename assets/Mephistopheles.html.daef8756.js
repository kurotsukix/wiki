I have a hypothesis for you, my Master.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> I know this is sudden.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> But this world is ruled by an oppressor. Yes, a bad person. A very bad person!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> And so I&#39;ve taken it upon myself to fix this. By blowing things up!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> And I want your help, you see.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Stalk the streets of London at night with me, and we&#39;ll set bombs!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Huge, amazing explosions! Dreadnought-class disaster! Come, let us travel to London!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Oh, Mash? Would you like to come with us? You&#39;re more than welcome.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> If you can? If you&#39;ve nothing better to do? If you want to spoil the fun?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;ll go with you no matter what, Master. Being alone with him seems like suicide.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Hehe, hehehehehe! Yes, of course! You must be ready for anything!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> And off we go, everyone!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...He dragged us off so quickly I didn&#39;t have time to object.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I guess we&#39;ve got no choice. I can&#39;t contact the Doctor, so we&#39;ll just have to follow him.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Here we go! Here we go! Here we go! We start with golems, it seems!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> This must be a test of our abilities. Come, Master.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Let&#39;s tear them apart!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Heheh, too easy! Too easy! Weaker than the weakest of insects.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Golems... So our opponent is a mage, is that right, Mephistopheles?</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> ...Indeed! Well, basically.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Basically...?</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Now, now, don&#39;t worry about it! Let&#39;s go! Let&#39;s fight!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Now we have to set up the bombs. Beep, beep, beep!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Begin\u2013the countdown!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> And look, more enemies! Oh, how boring, just so boring.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Ye who possess no Command Spells, no arrogance, no pride, and no greed. My past Master!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> As your Servant, I shall finish you off without any hesitation!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> And now, time for our next bomb. Let&#39;s go, Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Um, Master. Something...seems strange...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No, sorry. Either way, it&#39;s clear that the enemy is trying to kill us.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> For now, let&#39;s cooperate with Mephistopheles.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Hehehehehe. The next bomb goes here.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> And look, the enemy arrives! Just what you&#39;d expect, right?</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Another homunculus? That Alchemist never changes, does he?</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Master, let us kill them! For justice! Hyahahaha!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Alchemist?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Two more bomb sites left to go. This right arm here is incredibly important to him, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Now, then, shall I finish him off? Setting the bomb!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> And now here comes the enemy!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Whew! Mephistopheles, this is the last one, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...You can tell us now. The enemy was your former Master\u2013</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Indeed! Indeed! Dr. Georg Faust!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> He forged me, he raised me, he feared me! And these bombs are a present for him.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> So he can live and die with a smile on his face. Now, time for the last battle!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> \u2013So you&#39;re here, Mephistopheles.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Of course I am, Faust!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Oh, oh! What a pathetic joke you are! How comical and beautiful!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> You&#39;re so ugly now I can&#39;t bear it!</p><p><strong>Faust:</strong> Shut up, you failure of a project. It was foolish of me to grant you self-awareness.</p><p><strong>Faust:</strong> And now you&#39;ve even betrayed your master\u2013!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> How could I not, when you&#39;re so boring?</p><p><strong>Faust:</strong> You bastard...</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Yes, it&#39;s because you&#39;re boring! You were such an ordinary mage!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> You sacrificed others as if it was ordinary and yet reaped no results at all!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> You pretended to chase distant, unseen dreams and yet wasted your time on your ordinary life!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> How boring! What a boring mage you are!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> So why should I be blamed for taking a boring, average mage and making him famous throughout history?</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Poor little Mephistopheles just doesn&#39;t understand.</p><p><strong>Faust:</strong> You... I&#39;ll kill you! I&#39;ll kill you, Mephistopheles!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Come on and try it. Now, my entertaining Master!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> This is the last battle! Shove that bomb up his butt!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Faust:</strong> Gahh... Aggh! ...You...traitor!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Oh no no. I granted your wish to never be forgotten, did I not?</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Without me, would Goethe ever have written Faust?</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> And without Faust, no one would have ever heard of you!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Hehehehehe! If you want someone to blame, blame Goethe! ..Bwah, ahahahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Faust:</strong> Damn you! Damn you! My curse upon you! My curse upon you, Mephistopheles!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> You&#39;re such a fool. A curse? Curses are like power-ups for me.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Now then. The bomb is set. And it&#39;s time to flip the switch.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> \u2013My thanks for playing along with that entertainment. Master, as long as you entertain me\u2013</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> I will never betray you. Probably... Ahahahaha!</p><p><strong>--SECTION BREAK--:</strong></p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Good morning, Master. What&#39;s wrong?
