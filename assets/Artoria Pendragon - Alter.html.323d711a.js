It&#39;s not impossible, but why?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m told it&#39;s a urgent request from Saber. Right, Senpai?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Haha, we can&#39;t turn down a request from the corrupted Saber, can we? That King of Knights is merciless.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> But the space inside the Greater Grail isn&#39;t stable. If you do a Rayshift, you&#39;ll likely get punted back out.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Well, I&#39;m sure Saber has something in mind. Let&#39;s get started.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Mash, take care of Fujimaru. If things get dangerous, let me know right away.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s the plan. Let&#39;s start the Rayshift, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Are we in...France? I thought we shifted into the Greater Grail...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Doctor? Doctor? Come in... Doctor?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> We can&#39;t contact him?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...So it seems. He said it was spatially unstable, but where are we\u2014</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I think Roman&#39;s slacking off?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Fou agrees, but...I can&#39;t be sure. I can&#39;t even establish a connection.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The inside of the Greater Grail is like a singularity, and the connection won&#39;t be stable, he said. But where are we\u2014</p><hr><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> We&#39;re inside Greater Grail in a fragment that doesn&#39;t exist. Think of it as a place that recreates beings that became the singularities.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Saber? You arrived first?</p><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> So you came too, Kyrielight? ...Alright, I suppose. Thank you for answering my wish, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> I&#39;m amazed you believed in me enough to Rayshift inside the Greater Grail.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I want an explanation.</p><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> There&#39;s no need for one. What you need are strong Servants.</p><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> I&#39;m simply granting you that wish.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> If it&#39;s what you want, Saber.</p><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> ...I see. If that&#39;s how you feel, then I won&#39;t hold back.</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master, Saber, footsteps on the road ahead! It appears to be enemies!</p><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> Let&#39;s start with a warm-up. We&#39;ll wipe them out, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That Shadow Servant... Um, Saber, is this place\u2014</p><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> Good guess Mash. This is one of the endings you passed by.</p><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> It&#39;s only a temporary recreation, &quot;but for the purpose of combat,&quot; this is not an illusion.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fooou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> More enemies! So this next Servant is\u2014</p><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> Fear not. You defeated them once, and this time the fate of the world isn&#39;t at stake. Enjoy the dance of death.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I-I can&#39;t see it that simply! Death is really scary!</p><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> Of course, enjoy the fear I&#39;m saying. The Heroic Spirit who entrusted himself to you would have.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh?</p><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> Fujimaru, conserve your energy because the next one&#39;s the big one. Defeat this one with 60% of your strength.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master, we&#39;ve arrived at the throne room. ...Oh, I knew it\u2014</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> \u2014Tsk, I wondered why &quot;I was here&quot; suddenly. So this is why.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> How truly upsetting. What is this? More of that nightmare?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Whose idea was it to drag out a fake who&#39;s already been defeated once?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Was it that Master there? Or that girl? No, that&#39;s not right.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Only a Heroic Spirit as tainted as me could come up with a bad idea like this.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Am I wrong? You, Britain&#39;s tainted King of Knights?</p><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> \u2014You&#39;re talkative. Did Jeanne d&#39;Arc talk a lot as well?</p><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> No, I&#39;m sure she did. She was happy to be called the Maiden of Orleans.</p><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> I&#39;m sure she liked to talk. What can I say, she had the mind of a peasant.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> \u2014Huh? What&#39;s your problem? Are all Britons idiots?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (Senpai, the air is choking with danger! There was no room for talking, anyway!)</p><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> Of course. We&#39;re here to defeat this woman.</p><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> Fujimaru, you are an inexperienced Master. Fight stronger, more terrifying foes and polish your skills.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Oh, so that&#39;s it. The kind King of Knights has prepared a trial for that Master.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Very well, I accept. But be careful, I&#39;m vulgar and very violent\u2014</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> And after what you did to me last time, I&#39;m ready to rip your head from your neck!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master, she&#39;s serious! Be extremely careful!</p><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> A splendid yell, flag-bearer. I&#39;m glad I chose you as an opponent.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> What? Trying to be a friendly? Disgusting! You think we can be best friends just because we&#39;re both evil?</p><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> No, I simply chose a worthy opponent to crush. I&#39;ve no emotional attachments towards you.</p><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> But I will say one thing...</p><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> Shadow of Jeanne d&#39;Arc, born of the Grail, you said we were both tainted beyond measure\u2014</p><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> But from where I stand, you are far more tainted than me.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Hehe\u2014That&#39;s my line, mere clone of that coward King Vortigern!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...Okay, okay, I lost, I lost.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> I don&#39;t have a grudge against your Master, so I&#39;ll be a good girl and disappear.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Enemy Servant annihilation confirmed... Whew. That was a tough fight...</p><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> ...Sympathy for two people who fell to evil, huh? I can&#39;t deny that.</p><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> I chose to rule by violence and instinct, and you chose to rule by fear and reason.</p><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> The more a Heroic Spirit was bound by ideals in their former life, the more they possess a twisted side like us.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Saber...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You and that Jeanne are different.</p><hr><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> That&#39;s just what you believe. But\u2014a Servant obeys their Master.</p><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> As long as you believe that, I won&#39;t be a fool and believe otherwise.</p><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> Also, your skills have improved a bit Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Of course!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> A little, but yeah.</p><hr><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> Glad to hear it. Let&#39;s return to Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> Women like Jeanne and I are only useful like this. If there&#39;s a next time, I&#39;ll find you another strong foe.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> You&#39;re back! What happened to you two?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Communications went dead, and for a moment the Humanity Foundation value for Fuyuki and France reverted to negative!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> A lot happened.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...It&#39;s as Senpai says. So much has happened and it&#39;s hard to explain.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;m tired and going to my room.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fooouu...</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I-Is that so? Sure, I guess. You two look exhausted, and things are okay for now.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Okay, I&#39;ll call an end to this Rayshift for now... But something seems strange.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> You guys didn&#39;t go to an amusement park or something without me, right? ...Nah, no way!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> There&#39;s no way you could just Rayshift to the Greater Grail, and fight a bonus stage with powerful opponents you&#39;ve already encountered!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fooouu...</p><h2 id="two-sides-of-a-coin" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#two-sides-of-a-coin" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Two Sides of a Coin</h2><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> Another chance has come, Fujimaru. Rayshift into the Greater Grail.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A-Again? Last time it was evil Jeanne, so this time...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Thug Emperor Nero?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Good-goody Lancelot?</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Mm, kyukyu, kyui!</p><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> You&#39;ll see when you get there... Though to tell the truth, I don&#39;t know myself.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You don&#39;t? You mean you can&#39;t pinpoint who it is we&#39;ll be fighting?</p><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> No, I have chosen the opponent. What I&#39;m saying is\u2014</p><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> I don&#39;t know who that person is. It seems like that one is fundamentally different than the other Heroic Spirits.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Fundamentally different... Was there someone like that? Oh, I feel like Elisabeth might be different.</p><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> That one is just a weird. ...Well, you&#39;ll sense it when we arrive.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> These are the Roman plains? I was sure it would be another throne room...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fooouu!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Th-This rumble...a giant? No, it&#39;s an army of giant golems!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What is that? They&#39;re burying the horizon! It&#39;s like the Great Wall of China is advancing on us...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> They&#39;re heading right for us! Saber, is that our opponent?</p><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> ...I think not, but I don&#39;t know. That golem army might be the same as that one.</p><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> Either way, we&#39;re busting through the wall Fujimaru. They don&#39;t see us as enemies.</p><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> They&#39;re just like a massive steamroller that crushes everything before it.</p><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> There&#39;s nothing to be gained by fighting them, and there are too many to defeat.</p><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> Concentrate on a few and open a gap in the wall!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Wow... It&#39;s like a tsunami.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Those giants have no will of their own, but there seems to be a will guiding them.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> &quot;End all civilization on this planet.&quot; I&#39;m not sure, but that&#39;s what their command sounds like...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s an exaggeration...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I feel it...</p><hr><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> They certainly won&#39;t halt. \u2014Do not be afraid. Fujimaru, we shall pierce through the second wave as well.</p><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> Our real target lies beyond this wall of giants. We shall see if Mash&#39;s instincts were correct!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We made it past the giants! That&#39;s the Heroic Spirit Altera, the one we saw in Rome!</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> ...So a lifeform besides me appears in my dream? Answer me. Who are you?</p><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> That&#39;s what I want to know, white Heroic Spirit. Mash called you Altera, but\u2014</p><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> Are you really Altera? You don&#39;t seem like the conqueror they called the Scourge of God.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> ...You disturb my dream, and then insult me? You are...Britain&#39;s King of Knights, yes?</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> I am Altera. My appearance and this blade are proof of that.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> \u2014Answer me. What makes you doubt the truth that I speak?</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> If your answer displeases me, I&#39;ll show no mercy. I&#39;ll incinerate you and this world.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (Senpai, she seems to understand us more, but she sounds a lot more angry!)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (But I understand that feeling.)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (If this is Altera&#39;s dream, it would be embarrassing for others to see it!)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Sorry, we didn&#39;t mean to pry into your dreams...</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> ...It doesn&#39;t matter if you intended to or not. The fact is, you&#39;re humiliating me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You&#39;ve got some crazy dreams.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> ...I know. Even I don&#39;t know why I have these dreams.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> But\u2014that&#39;s why I can&#39;t forgive you. You have peeked into my inexplicable dreams.</p><hr><p><strong>Altera:</strong> Answer me. Why do you mock me so?</p><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> ...Why, you ask? I finally understand now after coming here.</p><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> Oh great conqueror and Heroic Spirit Altera. You have become a paradox.</p><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> Some kings conquer to satisfy their people. Some kings rule to satisfy their own greed.</p><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> Each definition of kingship varies. Everyone has their own ideology, and justifiable goals.</p><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> But\u2014you are different. You are a conqueror and a destroyer.</p><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> Some kings bring destruction in their conquest, but no king brings destruction after a conquest.</p><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> That is not a king who rules man. That is a Demon God who denies the world of man.</p><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> I ask again, Heroic Spirit Altera. Are you really\u2014a Heroic Spirit like us?</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> \u2014I have no answer for that. As the head of the Huns, I simply fought and slew our enemy.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> It was you people who called me a king, a hero, a God of War.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> Or would you, a fellow Heroic Spirit, deny me? Just like me, you can only destroy.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> \u2014I don&#39;t like you. I don&#39;t like you at all.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> Begone from my dream. This plain of destruction is mine alone. I don&#39;t want to see any humans!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Wow... All the Mana in the atmosphere is being drawn into her blade!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So that is the Sword of Mars, the Noble Phantasm that can incinerate the world!</p><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> Excellent. Altera herself was a disappointment, but that Noble Phantasm is a worthy foe.</p><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> If it&#39;s going to swallow all the Mana in the world, it will be an excellent opponent.</p><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> My heart is that of a dragon. The Od in my body shall resist the breath of the World.</p><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> Let&#39;s go, Master! It&#39;s time to see whose Noble Phantasm is the strongest!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> That...sword...was tempered inside the planet itself... It&#39;s a true Divine Weapon?</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> I know it...I know this pain... That&#39;s...What era was that\u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Heroic Spirit Altera annihilation confirmed. Did we...win?</p><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> So it seems. I thought she was like Jeanne, another Heroic Spirit twisted by the Grail, but\u2014</p><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> It seems she was twisted from before. Enough that she herself didn&#39;t know who she was.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What are we going to do about this?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Saber, the world&#39;s collapsing!</p><hr><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> Don&#39;t worry, this is Altera&#39;s dream. Since she disappeared, the dream will wake up.</p><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> Our minds will return as the world ends. It may leave a small aftertaste, but do not fret.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> S-So we&#39;re experiencing a simulation of the end of the world... This is the kind of bad feeling I don&#39;t want to know...</p><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> Forgive me. I tried to be of use to my Master, but this time I failed.</p><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> Once this world ends, let us meet again. Don&#39;t worry Fujimaru, it wasn&#39;t a complete waste.</p><p><strong>Saber Alter:</strong> Battling Altera increased my own power. I shall show you an even more powerful slash in our next battle.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, Saber just left without us! Senpai, we, um...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> We&#39;ll wait until it&#39;s completely white.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I-I knew it\u2014!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Mash, close your eyes if you&#39;re scared.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I-I can&#39;t! Closing my eyes just makes me more scared!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m done doing favors for Alter! Senpai, next time, think more about your actions, okay!</p>',211),a=[s];function i(g,h){return e(),r("div",null,a)}var l=t(n,[["render",i],["__file","Artoria Pendragon - Alter.html.vue"]]);export{l as default};
