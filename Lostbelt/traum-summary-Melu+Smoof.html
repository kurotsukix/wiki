Vinci and Sion talk about their opinions on human perfection and mistakes</p></li><li><p>Nemo interrupts their talk and reports that the Storm Border has left the Arctic Circle</p></li><li><p>Nemo tells Sion to report on the current situation</p></li><li><p>Sion&#39;s report:</p><ul><li>It&#39;s been several days since the British Lostbelt collapsed</li><li>After Chaldea peacefully pacified the young beast Koyanskaya, the Foreign God attacked and destroyed their homebase, the Wandering Sea</li><li>Everyone of Novum Chaldea&#39;s staff was quickly evacuated to the Storm Border</li><li>U-Olga Marie&#39;s power is still something that cannot be properly measured in a normal sense</li><li>The Spiritron Calculation Engine Trismegistus II and Near Future Observation Lens SHEBA are both built into the Storm Border, Chaldea&#39;s new base of operations.</li><li>Chaldea&#39;s journey continues, being on the run from U-Olga Marie while using Trismegistus II&#39;s future prediction capabilities to find a safe location to re-locate to.</li></ul></li><li><p>The Storm Border moves throughout the Eurasian Continent, converting the remaining buildings into spiritron resources while staying in long-term stealth mode in the Arctic Circle.</p></li><li><p>Trismegistus II identifies the Arctic Circle as the safest place, given that the Foreign God did not attack that location.</p></li><li><p>Da Vinci tells that the weaponization of the Holy Sword Essence retrieved from the British Lostbelt is almost finished. All that&#39;s left is to run several tests with it via simulator.</p></li><li><p>With Gordolf&#39;s, Holmes, Da Vinci&#39;s, and the rest of Chaldea staff&#39;s consent, Chaldea will be leaving the Arctic Circle, and head to the South American Lostbelt to take the fight to the Foreign God.</p></li><li><p>Just as Da Vinci finishes her explanation, an alarm sounds. An abnormal situation has occurred. Trismegistus II and SHEBA&#39;s future predictions are encountering errors. Unknown hindrances have been detected within Novum Chaldea&#39;s Foreign God Subjudgation procedures.</p></li><li><p>A decay within Pan-Human History&#39;s proof values has been detected. A current ephemeral threat greater than the interferences in the past has been detected. Chaldea staff are recommended to immediately rayshift to deal with the situation.</p></li><li><p>SHEBA is observing the greatest past &quot;Direct Attack upon Human History&quot;: A large-scale singularity.</p></li></ul><h2 id="section-1-the-coffin-shop-is-my-only-friend" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-the-coffin-shop-is-my-only-friend" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 1: The Coffin Shop is my Only Friend</h2><p>Soliloquy. ■, ■ can&#39;t understand. Living, dying, standing, sitting, thinking, feeling, wishing, praying. None of that. Neither pain, nor joy. No sense of unease, nor relief. Only the foreboding knowledge of the end. To die without meaning in a place like this. But, something within was prolonging my life just a little. So I ask, until the end... as what a human should be. Not through prayer, but singing. This is, the only thing, that ■ can do, right now.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> (■■■■ it,■■■)</p><p>(Red lights flash, and the darkness becomes a dark fog)</p><p>Soliloquy. Ahh, that&#39;s right. I probably am a traitor, for betraying Pan-Human History, and all sincerity. This is probably due to my incompetence, or should I call it, competence?</p><p>My sin, my karma, my duty. The day when all that ends will finally come, under the waterfall called Reichenbach.</p><hr><p>(Scene ends, then shifts to the Storm Border Bridge)</p><p>Sion begins her briefing on the large-scale singularity. The time period is shaky, but somewhere before 1700 CE at the minimum deviation of at least 100 years. Location is unidentifiable, but based on analyzing the plant distribution, the Far East, Africa, or Europe are ruled out, leaving America. Mana output isn&#39;t as thick as the Age of Gods, but observed values of disturbances report extremely high levels continuously rippling like a pond where rain falls. Sion wonders if someone&#39;s haphazardly firing off Anti-Army Noble Phantasms over there.</p><p>The other factor is the Human Foundation Value being ERROR, something that has never occurred before and not associated with EX rank. Da Vinci explains that the smallest mini-singularity would be classified as an E- rank with no need to rank others below it, but the singularity in question cannot be classified as a singularity in the first place. Gordolf wonders if it&#39;s some sort of bug, but whatever it is, it&#39;s something with no answer. Only way to find out is to go there.</p><p>Sion now introduces the rayshift compatible candidates for this mission: Sherlock Holmes.</p><p><strong>Guda:</strong> &quot;Nice to have you, Baritsu!&quot;</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> &quot;Hahaha, is that a greeting?&quot;</p><p>Since Ortenaus is still undergoing maintenance due to extended use in the Fairyland and Tunguska, Mashu is unable to participate. It doesn&#39;t look like Fou would go either, but the next candidate is announced: Vlad III.</p><p>Only three candidates are eligible for rayshifting. Mashu cannot rayshift, so Holmes was selected. Vlad was chosen after some...not-so violent methods were used when consulting the other applicable servants. Vlad III reassures Guda and dematerializes until needed.</p><p>With Holmes and Vlad chosen, Sion announces one more candidate, a special guest who will also be rayshifting...</p><p><strong>Guda:</strong> &quot;One more...?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> &quot;That&#39;s right. With two Masters, we can cover more ground.&quot;</p><p><strong>Mashu:</strong> &quot;Sion! you don&#39;t mean...!&quot;</p><p>A wild Kadoc appears.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/H9zVksg.png" alt=""></p><p>Note: Fun fact - The classic main menu theme plays when Kadoc is re-introduced</p><p>Kadoc is a Crypter, but his Lostbelt is destroyed, and his refuge called Olympus is no more. The only option he had was to surrender. Of course it would be hard for Chaldea to believe him, but Kadoc will prove his worth with his actions.</p><p><strong>Guda:</strong> &quot;And that collar?&quot;</p><p>(Kadoc opens his coat and reveals said collar)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> &quot;You&#39;re sharp. Sion, explain.&quot;</p><p>The collar is a mage-killer device developed by Atlas Academy. If Kadoc were to do anything suspicious, attempt to remove the device, or use unauthorized magecraft, the collar will trigger and destroy all of his magic circuits, killing him. Of course this annoys Kadoc since he&#39;s essentially nerfed, but Guda welcomes him to the party. Of course being the senior, Kadoc tells Guda that a magus should not be careless with info and must always watch their Command Seals. Da Vinci points out that Guda, although they do have master aptitude, isn&#39;t really a magus, and so requests Kadoc to teach them.</p><p>In the back, Holmes whispers to Sion regarding Kadoc&#39;s Siriuslight:</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> &quot;He can&#39;t release it. Put it on hold for now.&quot;</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> &quot;Understood. If the Foreign God could remotely activate the Siriuslight, then she would had done so. It&#39;s not good to be caught off-guard.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> &quot;You&#39;re right. I&#39;ll pull the trigger if that Siriuslight, let alone a Command Seal, were to go off.&quot;</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> &quot;Best not to go that option if possible.&quot;</p><p>Onto the last explanation. There are some keywords regarding the singularity that were extracted by HIEROGLYPH: No problems. Revolt. Two Eyelids.</p><p>Guda is confused, and so is Sion. What she thinks of these words are two points: &quot;That you cannot escape from this singularity&quot;, &quot;That it is on the same level as the seven singularities&quot;. Da Vinci thinks that this singularity will impede their progress to the seventh Lostbelt and thus recommends its destruction. Guda begins their rayshift.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/dirVagd.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>--SECTION BREAK--</strong></p><p>In any time, place, and idea, nothing is more difficult to succeed than in war.</p><p>Die, die, die, die.</p><p>There is nothing but careless death. No race, gender, or age involved. Those who were sustained by skill, hard work, and luck were already dead to the point of disinterest. It is the nature of living beings to become lumps of flesh when they die. Even so, as servants, they are not even allowed that privilege. If they die, they will disappear, leaving neither proof nor records behind.</p><p>To die a crazed yet abrupt death, whether they be a hero who saved a nation or an anti-hero who brought harm. To simply die as a matter of course for one reason or another.</p><p>War never changes. No matter the era, no matter the development of civilizations. To kill one another is the final step of negotiation.</p><p>They have one goal. To rebel. Not against a king, a god, nor the world, but against Pan-Human History.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/TRd7sHz.png" alt=""></p><p>(Inside a chamber, three soldiers stand firm)</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;Do you understand why you were summoned?&quot;</p><p>Even they, veteran heroes who were summoned as servants, found this castle to be unbearable. What lies within this castle is crimson splendor and pitch-dark madness. An ordinary person would go mad from this. The embodiment of this madness is beauty in front of them.</p><p><strong>Class・Saber:</strong> &quot;Wait, Kriemhild-sama. I really don&#39;t rememberー&quot;</p><p>(The beauty walks up and smiles)</p><p>Her name is Kriemhild. She is the queen who killed her husband Siegfried and sworn vengeance in the Nibelungenlied.</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong> &quot;You fled before your enemy.&quot;</p><p><strong>Class・Saber:</strong> &quot;...!&quot;</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong> &quot;You turned a blind eye on them.&quot;</p><p><strong>Class・Archer:</strong> &quot;...!&quot;</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong> &quot;Your reckless pursuit threw the battlefield into chaos.&quot;</p><p><strong>Class・Rider:</strong> &quot;...&quot; &quot;...&quot;</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong> &quot;Say it.&quot;</p><p><strong>Class・Saber:</strong> &quot;I fled because Rider threw everything into disorder.

There are no children on the battlefield, and even if they are, they&#39;re servants. If you can&#39;t even comprehend that logic, then you deserve the death penalty.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And...&quot;</p><p>(Kriemhild slashes Rider, who is barely clinging onto life)</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/aeqFn6N.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Class・Rider:</strong> &quot;W....h....y...&quot;</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong> &quot;You believe me to be a docile maiden who needs rescuing because I have this kind of personality. How shrewd. How wise. I have no use for you.</p><p><strong>Class・Rider:</strong> &quot;Damn... you... You&#39;re just... a... crazed demon... hellbent on... vengeance...&quot;</p><p>(Rider is decapitated.)</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong> &quot;Even now?&quot;</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;...Ho-ho-ho. So you made another bloody spectacle, huh.&quot;</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong> &quot;Isn&#39;t cleaning part of your job, Zhang Jue?&quot;</p><p>(An old man, Zhang Jue, appears.)</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/BIUss3w.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Zhang Jue:</strong> &quot;Why indeed.

That damned man really is skilled in defensive warfare.&quot;</p><p><strong>Zhang Jue:</strong> &quot;He&#39;s a hero who made a name for himself with this tactic. ... Oops, excuse me.&quot;</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong> &quot;And how goes your end?&quot;</p><p><strong>Zhang Jue:</strong> &quot;I am mobilizing all my Taiping Arts and puppet knowledge, but it will take the entire night to do so.&quot;</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong> &quot;I will provide you time and funds, but you better succeed, otherwise you will leave me no choice but to behead you as well.&quot;</p><p><strong>Zhang Jue:</strong> &quot;Ho-ho. I assure you with all my heart and soul that it will be done.&quot;</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong> &quot;...Hmph. Fine. What about the new servant?&quot;</p><p><strong>Zhang Jue:</strong> &quot;I see you summoned another one. I thought many of them were at the other encampment this time.&quot;</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong> &quot;Hm ...And the Royal Roads?&quot;</p><p><strong>Zhang Jue:</strong> &quot;Still no movement on their end. My men aren&#39;t finding anything other than just scouting.&quot;</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong> &quot;I see. I suppose they&#39;re aiming to play both sides.&quot;</p><p><strong>Zhang Jue:</strong> &quot;They lack the strength for an immediate attack, but it is something that we cannot ignore. What a nasty position to be in.&quot;</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong> &quot;And this lead to our current situation. How annoying.&quot;</p><p><strong>Zhang Jue:</strong> &quot;...I&#39;m afraid so.&quot;</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong> &quot;Keep Assassin on watch at all times.&quot;</p><p><strong>Zhang Jue:</strong><strong>&quot;Very well.

Monitor them until we know their true intentions.&quot;</p><p><strong>Zhang Jue:</strong> &quot;Our spies are somewhat lacking, though...&quot;</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong> &quot;Recall back some of the Assassins scouting the Royal Roads.

First, to explain things in a single wordー&quot;</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong> &quot;They&#39;re the enemy. Nothing more, nothing less.&quot;</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong> &quot;And we have to fight them?&quot;</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong> &quot;We kill them.&quot;</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong> &quot;I see. But, if there is a valuable head, may I please receive it?&quot;</p><p><strong>Kriemhild:</strong> &quot;I&#39;ll think about it, though I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll be there.&quot;</p><p><strong>Salome:</strong> &quot;Is that so? How unfortunate... Well, I&#39;ll be going out. Would you like me to buy you something? Like umm, a sachertorte?

That&#39;s why everyone is prepared to fight for your sake.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;I—— don&#39;t think of myself as worthy of such value...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;A person&#39;s worth is determined by others, not themselves. No matter how much you deny it, to despise yourself, to blame yourself for this dreamlike fairy-tale, we will always adore you. It must be hard for you, right?&quot;</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;Why yes. To be honest, it really is hard for me!&quot;</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;Hahaha, now that&#39;s harsh!&quot;</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;I wish I could at least face death with laughter and satisfaction.&quot;</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;Pope, we will not let you walk the path of death. This is our oath, and my conviction.&quot;</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;And that is the weight of such a thing! Well okay, fine. Let&#39;s just do what we must until the very end! But, I have only one thing to ask of you, Emperor.&quot;</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;What is it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;All these acts of treachery, inhumanity, cruelty, and ruthlessness. Are they all for the sake of my wishes, and not just for you to find a place to die?&quot;</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;That&#39;s a hard question to answer. If that is not what you desire... I see. It is a trivial matter, but I will give my life for it. The life of a fallen nation&#39;s emperor isn&#39;t of any significance.&quot;</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;I—— no, that&#39;s right. This might be out of my own self-interest, but I want to see a little more, no, I need to see more.&quot;</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;Is that the Lord&#39;s voice to you?&quot;</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;I&#39;m not sure. The Lord&#39;s messages are a complicated matter, and at times incomprehensible to someone as irrelevant as I, or it could be that I——&quot;</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;That&#39;s enough, Pope. Any further will only lead to unrest and blasphemy.&quot;</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;Well, how rude. I am a very well-informed person.&quot;</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;Really...&quot;</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;Now then. I will head out to see it as always.&quot;</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;Ah, by all means. I will need to formulate a strategy with my men. It&#39;ll be a little bit late going over there.&quot;</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;Yup. Now... one more thing, if you don&#39;t mind.&quot;</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;Hm?&quot;</p><p>(The pope walks up to the man and taps him.

First off, report.&quot;</p><p><strong>Class・Saber:</strong> &quot;As you say. A medium-sized force from Vengeance has invaded three hours ago. They appeared to be moving to collapse Trigonion Fortress. The thirty Archers positioned earlier all used their Noble Phantasms and eliminated them.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;Ah, so I was right.&quot;</p><p><strong>Class・Saber:</strong> &quot;Yes. However, just before the retreat was ordered, ten servants attempted to pursue and as a result were wiped out.&quot;</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;...I told them to stay on guard, not to pursue.&quot;</p><p><strong>Class・Saber:</strong> &quot;Right. They were a force of Riders, Berserkers, Assassins who acted on their own accord. They were marching ahead, I would say. And then...</p><p>(Saber pulls Rider over)</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;Are you the servant who hastily ordered that march?&quot;</p><p><strong>Class・Rider:</strong> &quot;I, I... apologize...&quot;</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;...Do you feel any remorse for what you have done?&quot;</p><p><strong>Class・Rider:</strong> &quot;Y-yes, I do...!&quot;</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;Do you think you will be granted mercy?&quot;</p><p><strong>Class・Rider:</strong> &quot;That&#39;s... umm... that&#39;s...&quot;</p><p>(The man smiles)</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;Heh.

You are forgiven, and for the rest of you guys, don&#39;t be too hard on them. Needless to say, you&#39;re all here because you want to prove yourselves. That is, even if you do succeed.&quot;</p><p><strong>Class・Saber:</strong> &quot;Right!&quot;</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;Very well, next.&quot;</p><p><strong>Class・Archer:</strong> &quot;These two were having a quarrel.&quot;</p><p>(Saber and Berserker are shown briefly)</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;It&#39;s not good for fellow servants to fight amongst each other.

Beings who either resisted the flow of history, were swallowed up, or vanished. Our reasons for defending the Human Order have already disappeared. I——— can never forgive Pan-Human History.

As I thought, we can&#39;t hold onto this deception forever. The famous Karl the Great not showing up at all... being injured in some way, or occupied with more important matters.

Very well, I will send the scouts out. It won&#39;t be just Assassins but also Riders and Casters as well. I will leave the defenses to the other classes. They can hold the area to some degree.

I wonder will happen next.&quot;</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ycMurIP.png" alt=""></p><p>The scene then switches to the rayshift, but something has gone wrong, as if the rayshift itself is glitching. Nonetheless, Guda, Kadoc, Holmes, and Vlad III successfully land at a grassy area, but the rayshit question still remains. Communications with Chaldea are still retained via Mashu, and she also noticed the anomaly. Fortunately, Mashu confirms that everyone has safely arrived without any further issue.</p><p>The group prepares to heads north, with Holmes acting as the rearguard while the Masters are in the middle. Suspicious noise is heard at first, but Holmes dismisses it and the group moves on.</p><p>Clear skies. The pleasant sound of the warm wind over the meadows. Everything is quiet. Peaceful. And that is why I cannot help but feel a frightening sense of foreboding approaching. It wasn&#39;t Guda, Kadoc, Vlad III, or Holmes who felt this premonition, but...</p><p>Back at the Storm Border, Da Vinci remains silent.</p><p>Still, it was only this girl who compelled them to investigate this singularity...</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/nOtn9Oq.png" alt=""></p><p>The group reaches the village, only to find it destroyed. Vlad does not sense the presence of anyone in the village. Holmes requests Kadoc to analyze the ruins, which the latter agrees to despite it not being his specialty. While Kadoc gets to work, Holmes speculates that the rubble, and by extension the destroyed village, was the result of not human activity, but one of magecraft nature.</p><p>Kadoc concludes that the entire area has been woven by magecraft, akin to a Caster&#39;s Territory Creation. An ordinary magus would have difficulty accomplishing this task, so a servant is likely the culprit. Holmes finds it strange that the town&#39;s architecture is from a time period between medieval and early modern Europe. He likens the situation to a picture set, where if there were faint traces of human activity, that activity would had taken some time to accomplish, whereas someone like a servant could do this in an instant.</p><p><strong>Vlad III raises his thoughts:</strong> If the town was created not by a servant, but by someone close to that level, then who could had destroyed it? Holmes believes that it couldn&#39;t be a natural disaster, and there&#39;s no evidence of an animal rampage. Traces of arrow holes, swordfights, and wheel tracks indicate that there was a fight between servants.</p><p>As soon as Holmes says that, Mashu detects servant signatures and tells everyone to be on guard. She counts their numbers... only to be shocked and call Da Vinci to confirm if there was a mistake or something. Da Vinci tells Guda that an army of one hundred is attacking, all of them being servants. Everyone is shocked and Holmes asks for a re-confirmation, to which Da Vincis confirms that they are all servants and orders everyone to retreat and hide.</p><p>Mashu later notices another army of servants of similar number approaching. This town will soon become a battleground between the two servant armies, and there is no time to negotiate between either, so the best course of action is to hide. However, since Guda and Kadoc aren&#39;t servants, hiding their presence would be difficult, and staying as a group would quickly rat them out, so Holmes suggests that the Masters find a different place to hide while he and Vlad will find a different way to get through this ordeal. Vlad tells Guda to use a Command Seal if the situation worsens. Holmes wishes the Masters good luck as he goes to gather information on the servants.</p><p>Guda and Kadoc find a good hiding spot and dig a hole to hide in. Kadoc then uses a camouflage magecraft to hide their presence. Although he&#39;s unsure if it&#39;ll work against servants, it&#39;s better than nothing.</p><p><strong>Guda:</strong> &quot;That&#39;s amazing...&quot;</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> &quot;What do you mean amazing? This is just elementary magecraft.&quot;</p><p>Guda expresses interest in learning Magecraft from Kadoc, but Kadoc dismisses it saying that his magecraft is now outdated. The magecraft in question is anti-beast magecraft, designed strictly against beast foes. In ancient times, humanity had to fight not only themselves but also wild beasts capable of defeating ordinary humans, so anti-beast magecraft was created. In the modern era where wild beasts are no longer a commonplace, this magecraft has become obsolete.</p><p><strong>Guda:</strong> &quot;Have you thought about quitting magecraft altogether?&quot;</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/pV6LXXp.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> &quot;...&quot; &quot;...&quot;</p><p>&quot;You caught me off with that question, but no. Now, let me tell you this. Any honest to proper magus would kill you for asking that question. Anyone would be offended if you told them &#39;Your life&#39;s worthless, so why don&#39;t you die?&#39;&quot;</p><p><strong>Guda:</strong> &quot;I&#39;m sorry...&quot;</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> &quot;Well, it&#39;s not like I can do anything about it thanks to this collar... sorry, that was just a snide remark. I guess I&#39;m bad at situations like this...&quot;</p><p>The armies are getting closer, so Kadoc cuts the idle talk. All Guda and Kadoc can do is pray that they don&#39;t get caught.</p><p>A Vengeance Realm (Red) Saber reads off a report from scouts: They will be facing a mid-size enemy force. Vengeance&#39;s strategy is to have Archers fire off a simultaneous volley of Noble Phantasms while their Riders cover the ground. The Sabers and Lancers will then push through the middle and attack at the same time the Riders disorient the enemy. Their success depends on the timing of their Noble Phantasms.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> &quot;Unbelieveable... they really are all servants...&quot;</p><p><strong>Guda:</strong> &quot;Their true names...&quot;</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> &quot;We don&#39;t know, but they all come from different time periods and nationalities, and yet they&#39;re all one army... I can&#39;t believe it. Just what in the world is this singularity...? In the first place, even the Holy Grail has a limit to how many servants it can summon. Are they... stray servants?&quot;</p><p><strong>Guda:</strong> &quot;Are they a type without a Master?&quot;</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> &quot;Yeah. You ran into a few of them in Singularities and Lostbelts. Exceptional servants tied to the land and the Holy Grail and summoned by them. This would be the case with Beowulf in the Russian Lostbelt. But, this amount of servants is abnormal. Taking the other side into account, there are two hundred servants here. We might be wiped out alongside this village...</p><p><strong>Guda:</strong> &quot;So even this area is unsafe...&quot;</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> &quot;We were supposed to escape from this soon-to-be battlefield, but at least they aren&#39;t coming to look for us. Well, let&#39;s see what happens next.</p><p><strong>Guda:</strong> &quot;Aren&#39;t you getting a little desperate?&quot;</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> &quot;I&#39;m... not... I&#39;ll reflect on that.&quot;</p><p>The battle begins. Red Saber orders the Archer group forward.

Must be my imagination. Alright, let’s head back! Tonight, we&#39;re getting completely naked till morning!</p><p><strong>Servants:</strong> Completely…naked?</p><p>Note: Back to 妖兰 TL</p><p>After Roland and the Royal Road Servants leave, Holmes and Vlad appear and assures Guda and Kadoc that it&#39;s safe to come out. The masters were insanely lucky to have survived the heat of the battle and not get caught. As for the village, most of it is reduced to rubble, but some buildings still stand intact. Holmes reckons that it&#39;s a good opportunity to do some information gathering.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/5my07ff.png" alt=""></p><h2 id="section-2-the-young-emperor" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-the-young-emperor" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 2: The Young Emperor</h2><p>The group stay in the village tavern. After some talk about tea, alcohol, and wine, Holmes asks the masters to brief the rest of Chaldea on their encounter: the servant armies.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> &quot;I once dreamed of this nonsense, but never have I imagined that it would come to pass.&quot;</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> &quot;According to the records on our database, the highest number of servants present in a battle was a seven versus seven. For numerous servants to fight would require an exceptional case such as the final singularity.&quot;</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> &quot;It was a miracle of sorts for all these servants to appear, even if it were the decisive battle for safeguarding humanity&#39;s future. The recent battle we witnessed with servants killing each other over controlling the village was unprecedented. I see, now that truly is fascinating...&quot;</p><p>Kadoc recalls the types of servants that were present in the battle: longbowmen from the Hundred Years War, samurai warriors from the Sengoku Period, harquebusiers, and even American cowboys. The Casters covered their faces, so their identities couldn&#39;t be discerned. Holmes adds that the seven classes were almost universally present across all servants, and their regional distribution was very broad.</p><p>The last thing in Kadoc&#39;s mind were the words &quot;Heroic Spirit Class&quot; and &quot;Phantom Class&quot;. Holmes believes that it is a saint graph ranking system used to classify heroes whose names weren&#39;t recorded in Pan-Human History, such as someone who fought in a famous battle. It&#39;s likely that these are unknown people, who are rarely summoned as servants, are being summoned, but Da Vinci says that they are without a doubt servants.</p><p><strong>Guda:</strong> &quot;Why are you emphasizing this confirmation, Holmes?&quot;</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> &quot;Ahh, yes. There is a big difference between a Servant-class Magical Beast and the servant itself. It&#39;s a somewhat broad terminology, but it&#39;s accurate to conclude that servants are &#39;Heroic Spirits with a Master present&#39;. Of course, this is a broad meaning.&quot;</p><p>&quot;In this instance, a stray servant would be a Heroic Spirit contracted by the land as a temporary Master... would be my assumption, but let&#39;s return to the topic at hand.&quot;</p><p>No matter how strong or weak they are, servants still need a Master, otherwise they cannot materialize as servants. This leaves the servants there as a big mystery. Who is their master, or if they have none, what is the exceptional cause behind this? This is still something that Holmes needs to further investigate into.</p><p>Next up are the realms, important terminologies that even the servants are concerned about: Vengeance, Restoration, and the Royal Way realms, three competing factions represented by a special color, and their leaders: Vengeance Realm&#39;s Kriemhild from Siegfried&#39;s legends, who can either be a Saber, Berserker, or Avenger, Restoration Realm&#39;s Constantine XI, the last emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, and lastly, the Royal Way Realm&#39;s Karl the Great, a big name, a fearsome one if he&#39;s the real deal, and the favorite to win if that&#39;s the case.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/L3IN2GD.png" alt=""></p><p>What concerns Holmes is the way the factions fight. The Royal Way Realm looks for opportune moments to strike while avoiding casualties on their side.</p><p>Holmes: &quot;Lord Vlad, do you consider this to be an appropriate tactic?&quot;</p><p>Vlad III: &quot;An appropriate tactic... hmm, merely.</p><p>Da Vinci: &quot;Merely?&quot;</p><p>Vlad III: &quot;It&#39;s a clash between medium-sized armies. In addition, the battles are fairly one-sided. If that&#39;s the case, it should be a decisive sweep depending on the timing of their intervention. If it were me, I would join the battle after going in a little deeper. The Restoration Realm&#39;s army immediately went and struck the Vengeance Realm&#39;s army to avoid getting pincer attacked. In addition, the Royal Way Realm&#39;s side wiped the exhausted Restoration Realm without any hesitation. They ignored the Vengeance Realm and dug themselves too deep into their enemy&#39;s ranks. Even with Archer and Caster&#39;s barrages, they anticipated equal casualties.</p><p>&quot;Based on what thy heard, the timing was indeed hasty.&quot;</p><p>Holmes: &quot;...&quot; &quot;... if it wasn&#39;t hasty.&quot;</p><p>Holmes thinks of multiple possibilities if the attack wasn&#39;t quick and sloppy.</p><p>Guda: &quot;Now&#39;s not the time to speak!&quot;</p><p>Holmes: &quot;Hahaha, I&#39;ve spoken too much. Now back to the actual topic, what the leaders are aiming for, and the numerous stray servants summoned by singularity&#39;s holy grail. In the past, many made their move for the sake of defending the Human Order. Servants summoned by rituals similar to Holy Grail Wars are fundamentally on the side of the Human Order. But even when speaking about Heroic Spirits, their natures vary. If a master were present, a servant&#39;s personality can shift from either a noble hero to a brutal monster. Both are still part of human nature, and are recorded regardless.&quot;</p><p>Holmes concludes that such a situation is inherently impossible. Servants of good and evil attributes organized into armies and moving together. Region, country, ideals, beliefs, lineage, all of that is shelved. Vlad comments that such a meaning would be for an ideal world, but something&#39;s off with the three realms warring each other. Kadoc wonders if they could be friend or foe, or temporary partners. Although Holmes would like them to be friends, Chaldea would still need to consider their approach. They are in an unknown battlefield full of organized servant armies after all. In addition, which of the realm&#39;s armies could they fight and defeat, taking into consideration their numbers and Noble Phantasms.</p><p>Vlad detects the presence of enemies. A Vengeance Realm Assassin appears, but Vlad disposes of them. Turns out, there are more Assassins running around. Kadoc wonders how Vlad could detect Assassins... through the smell of blood...? Anyways, Vlad goes outside the tavern to engage the Assassins while the rest stay inside.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ogARlaW.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p>Note: From now on, is Smoof TL</p><p>Vlad III: Silence, huh. Regardless, it does not change the fact that you are my enemies. Now let us hunt mercilessly. —Here I come. Be prepared to be struck by my stakes of remorse and sorrow.</p><p>After the battle, Da Vinci and Mashu state that their communications equipment are being jammed and are getting static with their communications. They predicted that this is something similar to the Britain Lostbelt, but Holmes says that such a thing was rejected but this place doesn’t seem to reject it.</p><p>Vlad III asks if there was anything to note within the battle. Kadoc mentions that they had Command Seals similar to Chaldea where it was supported and loaded. The question had been raised as to who is the Master supplying the seals. With Command Seals comes a light from a person’s hand, Kadoc concludes that the light of the opposing Command Seal came from far away. Holmes states that this town should have residents but there is fortunately none here.</p><p>A special warning has been alerted. Da Vinci states that with Muramasa’s help, they can detect Apostles of the Alien God. Holmes deduces that it can only be Grigori Rasputin since we’ve eliminated Limbo and Muramasa was incinerated. Kadoc senses that this is not Rasputin.</p><p>Holmes: You’re—</p><p>???: Greetings, dear Holmes. Well, I shouldn’t act like that in front of an older gentleman. How about, Sir Holmes.</p><p>Guda: You are…? No, it can’t be…! (If you played through Shinjuku)</p><p>Choice 1: ???: Oh, you never met me before, huh. Then I shall introduce myself.</p><p>Choice 2: ???: Ah, so you’ve met me before. This makes things faster.</p><p>???: Greetings. My name is James Moriarty.</p><p>Moriarty: I am a mathematician, consultant—and as you would’ve predicted, an Apostle of the Alien World.</p><h2 id="section-3-the-sin-known-as-pan-human-history" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3-the-sin-known-as-pan-human-history" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 3: The Sin Known as Pan-Human History</h2><p>I responded to a summoning from an overwhelmingly huge being before me. …I see, oh, I see. —-I understand now. I understood everything that needed to be done. An influx of knowledge and acquitted strength. Above all else, I understood everything about myself. Very well. I shall humbly accept this decree. I am the Napoleon of Crime, the Apostle of the Alien World. James Moriarty. I shall do what must be done.</p><p>Holmes: —-So. What’s your motive here, Professor.</p><p>Moriarty: Even you, Sir Holmes, are still too immature. My objective here is to eliminate you all, of course. To me, Chaldea is nothing but an impediment. I am an Apostle of the Alien World after all.</p><p>Holmes: (Apostle of the Alien World… So he’s not an Apostle of the “Alien God”?)</p><p>Note: Think of &quot;Alien World&quot; less as &quot;Alien Planet&quot; but more like &quot;Alien System&quot;. AKA, &quot;Moriarty is contracted to the Alien/Foreign God without the God, so he&#39;s just contracted to what&#39;s left, Alien/Foreign. This can&#39;t properly be conveyed in English.</p><p>As Da Vinci tries to identify him, Moriarty cuts off their communication. He proceeds to name everyone in the group. Holmes asks him again what his motives are.</p><p>Moriarty: Suppose I said that I’m here to subjugate a traitor, what would you do?</p><p>Kadoc: That’d be an honor, of course. I’d be laughing to my heart’s content at how intolerant the “Alien God” is. But I’m not the one after all.</p><p>Moriarty: Of course you aren’t. The “Alien God” has no interest in you at all.</p><p>Kadoc: Then that’s a relief.</p><p>Moriarty: I’d go as far as to say that you weren&#39;t even the traitor to begin with. Kirishtaria Wodime. He was the only person that the “Alien God” desired. Those who came after him were just toys that came with the meal.</p><p>Kadoc: I’m aware of that. (What does he mean by “toys that came with the meal”) Moriarty: There’s only one reason why I appear before you today.</p><p>Holmes: …! Everyone, run! Avoid confrontation at all costs!</p><p>Moriarty: You are slow after all, Sir Holmes. If you were the genuine Holmes, you would’ve seen through me before I arrived.</p><p>Holmes: …!</p><p>Vlad III: Kazikli Bey (Bloodstained King Demon)!</p><p>Vlad is surprised that his attack felt like it landed, but did not damage Moriarty at all. Unbeknownst to Vlad, Moriarty states his disappointment and that he has been bestowed by two authorities. Kadoc recognizes that he has Divine Spirits embedded with him just like with Limbo and Senji Muramasa. Kadoc also figures out that the Noble Phantasm did hit him, he just wasn’t harmed by it. It was as if he’d never got hit with it in the first place.</p><p>Moriarty: Infringing upon another person’s…no, another God’s powers is quite unnerving… … No, it is quite refreshing.</p><p>Vlad III notices that his attacks prove utterly meaningless.</p><p>Moriarty: You never realized it, haven&#39;t you, Sir Holmes? You never realized anything about me. Yet it’s the other way around. I am capable of it. To your thought process, to the actions you’ll take. This is all asymmetric in the end. I am the predator that preys on you.</p><p>Vlad III: As if!</p><p>Moriarty gets behind Vlad and restraints him mentally and not physically. Moriarty states that he knows what everyone will do next, not just Holmes. Moriarty asks if you’ve played shogi and explains that the more you capture, the more attacking options you gain. He continues saying that if you were up against a predator like him, you would have dropped everything and started fleeing. Moriarty uses his powers to corrupt him by saying “begin the rebellion”.</p><p>Moriarty: It is unclear which realm you shall choose to reside in. I wish you best of luck, Romanian Hero, Vlad III. Guda: Lord Vlad!</p><p>Vlad III: Don’t come near! This is…unfortunate… Rebel…rebel… I see, that’s how these Servants…became like this… Detective!</p><p>Holmes: —Lord Vlad.</p><p>Vlad III: I have now switched sides. I am now a traitor to humanity.</p><p>Moriarty: Life is very dramatic. Your journey doesn’t start if you don’t accept it.</p><p>Vlad III: …However. There is only one thing I hate in this world and it is coercion upon other people.</p><p>Moriarty: —!</p><p>Vlad III: Kazikli Bey (Bloodstained King Demon)!</p><p>Moriarty: …I see. It seems renown Servants do have their own spirit in a way. Not to die, not to yield, but to confine themselves to their own stakes. And— A wise judgment. Escaping simultaneously with the activation of the Noble Phantasm…no, just before, huh. They sacrificed their Servant, huh. No… It was as if someone shouted, “we’ll be back for you” in the end… At any rate, I’d like to start the chase. That being said—</p><p>Class Saber: You there, Servant. Who are you?</p><p>Moriarty: Oh my. I guess I stayed for too long. With that, they’ve gained some more time. All that lies ahead is where they’ll hide. —-Well. No matter where they hide, the result will be the same. Whether it be in Vengeance, Restoration or Nobility, it does not change that they will rebel against Pan-Human History.</p><p>Class Saber: What have you been blabbering about?</p><p>Moriarty: Ah yes, pardon me. Please forget everything you people have witnessed here. To be more specific. —Die.</p><h2 id="section-4-run-run-run-away" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4-run-run-run-away" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 4: Run, Run, Run Away</h2><p>As Holmes, Kadoc and you run towards the forest, an Archer spots the group. Kadoc says that the Archer might have either good eyesight or clairvoyance. Kadoc says to stay focused and run and questions whether Holmes thought this far. He also says that we might have encountered a patrol group. Holmes admits that this wasn’t his best idea, but the best that they had for now and has a few ideas. You almost reach the forest until someone paralyzes you.</p><p>???: Oh no, no, no. I didn’t expect those from Pan-Human History to appear so soon. This world is truly the Three Kingdoms period. Ah, I presume you’re already familiar with the trouble situation we’re in. That is why I’d gravely request that you avoid causing any further intervention.</p><p>Guda: I can’t move…!</p><p>???: This is the death of the Azure Sky. For now, we, the Vengeance Realm, will bring about prosperity throughout the world.</p><p>You tell Holmes to escape to which Kadoc questions if Holmes is alright with that to which he is. Holmes attacks the Archer and the mysterious man. Afterward, the man says to the Archer to leave them be but Archer insists by calling his name: Zhang Jue. You either don’t know him or do know him. Zhang Jue might have to kill him, but Archer states that Kriemhild wanted him alive.</p><p>Zhang Jue: We must do what must be done for now. Now, take him away.</p><p>Class Archer: Yes, sir!</p><p>Zhang Jue: —Ah, that’s right, that’s right. Are you accustomed to torture?</p><p>Guda: …….</p><p>Zhang Jue: It might be better to be accustomed to it? Fuhahahahahaha!</p><p>Cutting over to Kadoc and Holmes’s perspective, they choose to report before doing anything further. Mashu angrily stands up and tries to get them to Rayshift her into the Singularity. Gordolf slightly agrees about sending in reinforcements even if the situation isn’t in their favor. Da Vinci is very much against this and tells Mashu to check his vital signs. Mashu states that Guda’s vitals are a bit unstable, but overall still normal and healthy. Sion is also against a rescue operation.</p><p>Sion: As your superior, I am also against an immediate rescue operation with the current state that we’re in. According to SHEBA’s near future observations— It’s been observed that he’ll be alive for three days, but seven days at the very most.</p><p>Da Vinci asks Holmes for his input on the situation and what they should do. Holmes states that Guda will be interrogated or tortured or killed. This can be avoided unless he becomes hostile towards his captors. Gordolf hesitates before taking a bold step and stating his orders to Mashu.</p><p>Gordolf: Until the maintenance of Ortenaus is fully completed, you will be on standby for Rayshift. As long as we have evidence that he is still alive, launching our most valued fighter while she’s still in recovery is utterly foolish. We have been reassured of the current situation. Now, we must increase our chances of rescuing him.</p><p>Meuniere comforts Gordolf by asking how many times Guda has escaped death which makes Gordolf nervous. Da Vinci advises that they’ll negotiate his release when their communications are back online. Gordolf asks how they’ll negotiate to which Da Vinci responds by using the best trick which is to beg for their life. Gordolf goes into the back to get his stomach medicine. Holmes asks Kadoc about the Caster, but doesn’t know much. Holmes: I don’t know much either, but I do know that phrase. The phrase “the death of the Azure Sky” is an old Chinese declaration. However, the phrase continues. The Yellow Sky soon arises. “Yellow Sky” was a name given to a certain leader of a religious association. It was a renowned person who was an exceedingly outstanding Taoist. The name of the religion was the Way of Peace, the leader’s name was the legendary Taoist, Zhang Jue. As long as he exists here, our infiltration will nearly be impossible.</p><p>Holmes advises that breaking into the strong hold without any allies or information is prohibited. Da Vinci asks them where they plan to go. Holmes thinks about heading over to the Restoration Realm. Kadoc doesn’t mind it at all. Holmes plans to negotiate with them and search for the meaning of “Restoration”. They head out seeking an alliance which will increase their odds of saving Guda. Section 2:</p><p>Saber and Rider chat with one another about their background. Saber gets a bit annoyed that Rider forgot since they’ve been working together for several days. Saber tells Rider that he’s from the Hundred Year War, but doesn’t bother to share his real name. Saber mentions that Rider’s from Sicily, a country within Italy and Rider’s birthplace. Rider asks Archer about where they’re from as well. Archer is one of the knights of Fianna, but Saber cuts them off saying that no one will remember their true name. Saber tells them that they should only remember three warriors.</p><p>Class Rider: The first warrior is our great sage, Zhang Jue. The second warrior is the one who possessed the name of our realm, the Vengeance Queen—Queen Kriemhild. The final warrior…well nobody cares. There were also several warriors who did great efforts in the current war. Not long ago we had the Juvenile Rascal King, Billy the Kid, the Frenzy Pirate, Edward Teach. The Off-Season Flower, Kijyou Kouyou and the artificial berserk soldier, Frankenstein. Those people made their names out there with some of them choosing to die or die in battle…it’s different for everybody. Besides, having your name being remembered means you’ll be famous.</p><p>Saber and Rider have a friendly conversation with you. Rider says that you’re not a Servant or a civilian since it’d “be surprised if we saw one” so Rider deduced it down to you being a Master.</p><p>Class Rider: Alright, first try! So, where you from?</p><p>Class Saber: Probably Japan. You can just tell by his face.</p><p>Class Rider: Woah, a japanese person, huh. Oh, there was a Japanese person in another squad come to think of it. Zhang Jue asks if you’re uneasy which you respond by saying you are. He offers to tell you your fortune while Rider says that you’re lucky. Zhang Jue states that your fortune is both lucky and unlucky at the same time, but it’s overall bad luck which you are saddened by. Zhang Jue informs everyone that enemies are approaching.</p><p>Zhang Jue: They are approaching from the northeast. Now then, prepare for battle. I don’t know which realm they’re from, but let’s assess their ill fortune. I, the great sage Zhang Jue, stand before you. After the battle, they think that they’ve won the battle with no casualties, but Archer was killed in the midst of battle which was unfortunate. Even then they resume the march back to the Vengeance Realm where Kriemhild lies.</p><p>Zhang Jue: That is our defining feature. The Vengeance Realm has eroded places, thus staining the sky red. Plain and simple, right?</p><p>You enter into the Vengeance Realm. Rider escorts you through the gate and inwards towards the castle. Zhang Jue lays Saber off for the day and orders Rider to escort the prisoner to the castle. You question Rider if everyone here is a Servant. Rider informs you that everyone here is a Servant, not to mention the children that reside here as well. Rider also informs you that there’s also a marketplace, employment and culture here as well.</p><p>You arrive in the palace where Kriemhild resides. There, Zhang Jue states to the Queen that he has captured you. She states that this place is where fury and rage are justified and accepted. Kriemhild states that everyone here is a rebel towards Pan-Human History. Kriemhild desires to execute you as swiftly as possible, but Zhang Jue tries to prolong the notion by stating that they must interrogate him for information first before executing him. Zhang Jue also questions who’d be best for execution and thinks of Sanson. Kriemhild states to you that Pan-Human History is a foolish history where it has brought pain and suffering and she wants to eradicate it without a speck left. She calms down and tells Rider to throw you into your cell. ???: Heyy, heyyyyy. Can you hear me over there?</p><p>Guda: Who might you be, sir?</p><p>???: Yes, you can hear me. What a relief. Man, it’s been a long time since someone new came in. You alright?</p><p>Guda: I’m not doing well, I guess…</p><p>???: Well that’s a shame. Hm? Hmmm? Huh? Are you not a Servant?</p><p>You tell him that you’re a Master which is surprising to him.</p><p>???: Well I’m…just a minor Servant that’s all. I can’t even unleash my powers here anyway. A lot has happened, alright!</p><p>Guda: You can’t unleash your powers…?</p><p>???: Yea..to put it into words… My powers, right now, are weaker than an ordinary Caster!</p><p>Guda: Are you really fine over there!?</p><p>???: No, I’m not, that’s why I’m imprisoned here. Wahahaha. Well, there’s no use anyways. I’m on the side of protecting humanity, by the way.</p><p>Guda: Eh…!?</p><p>???: Yea, that’s right. I’m not a Servant that was summoned to rebel against humanity.
