I tried contacting Chaldea, but got no response.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I should&#39;ve heard Mash calling for me. Instead, all I can hear now is...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...If I had to describe it in colors, I guess it&#39;s red and black. It howls like a beast hungry for blood.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I&#39;m in a tight spot here. What Mystic Code did I put on before we left?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> If I could at least cast Gandr, I&#39;d shoot one off. Then, regardless of how that goes, I&#39;ll just book it as fast as I can!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...But, will that really work?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Sweat trickles down my cheek. My mouth trembles. Think. Think. But that beast doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;ll give me time to think...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I&#39;m taking a chance. Whether it&#39;ll work out or not...</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong> ...Are you all right? You should stand back.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (Turn around)</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> Hah!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (Step back)</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong> Good. Right there&#39;s fine.</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> Hmph!</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (Exhale)</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> ...You&#39;ve got some guts.</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> You watched that attack and didn&#39;t so much as flinch.</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> Do you have some knowledge of swordplay? Or, I suppose you have been through more than your share of trials...</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> Whoops, sorry. Looks like we don&#39;t have much time to chitchat.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...Thanks. You saved me.</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> You&#39;re welcome. Are you hurt, brave stranger?</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> You&#39;re certainly no ordinary person. If you were, you&#39;d have fainted when you stared that beast down.</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> I&#39;d love to talk to you more in detail... but I don&#39;t have the time.</p><hr><p><strong>Knight:</strong> A herd of beasts and their king are coming this way. I doubt we can reach a peaceful resolution.</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> If you don&#39;t mind, would you fight with me? You seem to be the type who&#39;s strong enough to do that.</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> Are you by chance a mage? Well, at least you don&#39;t seem to be completely lost in a battle of magecraft.</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> That magical energy enveloping you must be Command Spells. Are you a Master?</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> Well then, you must have some experience dealing with Mystics, which are so far beyond simple magecraft.</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> ...They&#39;re here. Sorry, I&#39;m just short on time. So, would you give me your answer?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Let&#39;s fight together.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;d appreciate it if you&#39;d let me!</p><hr><p><strong>Knight:</strong> Thank you. Now then, let&#39;s take this horde of beasts down together!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> Good. We managed to escape for now.</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> I knew it! You&#39;re a skilled mage. I&#39;m no expert on magecraft, but I can at least say this:</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> You have the power to fight. I don&#39;t just mean the skills necessary to fight...</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> You possess a sword. A sword that dwells within your heart, that is.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Knight:</strong> Hey. Did something happen?</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> You look a little unfocused. Did you use too much of your magical energy?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Um...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You look familiar.</p><hr><p><strong>Knight:</strong> I believe this is the first time we&#39;ve met. Based on what you&#39;re wearing, you must be from the 20th century.</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> Or perhaps from the beginning of the 21st century. You may have had an opportunity to meet me...</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> No, I don&#39;t remember.</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> Hey. You didn&#39;t come here alone, did you?</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> You must have gotten separated from your group. Am I right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> I see. Okay, got it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Exactly!</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> Haha. That&#39;s the spirit!</p><hr><p><strong>Knight:</strong> Okay. I will stay with you until you find your companions.</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> Don&#39;t worry. We&#39;ll find them soon enough.</p><p><strong>--SECTION BREAK--</strong></p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> UN-FREAKIN&#39;-BELIEVABLE!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> And where the hell have YOU been!? Why&#39;d you wander off like that!?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Don&#39;t think for one second you&#39;re gettin&#39; off easy just &#39;cause you came back in one piece. Next time, don&#39;t you dare wander off without telling me!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Sorry!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...Ugh.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I suddenly lost contact with Chaldea...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Oh yeah, Mash did mention something like that.</p><hr><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Um...the connection is maybe not so great.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> I mean, yeah, it&#39;s pretty damn cool we can communicate in real time with Chaldea, no matter where or when we are...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...but it&#39;s kinda useless once we start runnin&#39; into weird magical anomalies and crap like Bounded Fields, huh?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Hunting for Singularity remnants... I figured we could forget about them and they&#39;d disappear on their own.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Or...has it gotten so bad that it was on its way to becoming a full-blown Singularity?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, you are right. It was on the brink of becoming a miniature Singularity...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The swordsman that Senpai encountered was likely caught up in whatever was going on.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Oh, the guy who saved Master.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> We didn&#39;t see his face... He left right before we met up with Master.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Aw, c&#39;mon. I can&#39;t believe he&#39;s managed to survive wandering around this place alone. Who was he?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> His name was...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Now that you mention it...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I didn&#39;t ask.</p><hr><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> He left without giving his name? Hah. What a big shot. I can&#39;t put my finger on it, but something about him sort of pisses me off.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> U-um... Regardless of whether he&#39;s human or a Rogue Servant...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> He had amazing combat power. He was able to keep up with those giant creatures.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> According to Senpai...he was a hooded man who looked like a knight?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Huh? A hooded knight? That means he&#39;s not from that Singularity, to say the least.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> He was like a knight, or maybe a swordsman...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> He&#39;s like a knight in shining armor.</p><hr><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> What the heck?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai mentioned that the man&#39;s attire reminded [\u2642him /\u2640her] of the Knights of the Round Table. Isn&#39;t that right, Senpai?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> What? Us? But I don&#39;t remember anyone with a hood.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> I mean, Gareth wore a helmet all the time. And that jackass Percival didn&#39;t have anything either...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Or...uh, did he wear a helmet? Like, when he was super serious? ...No, wait... Er, maybe that was Palamedes?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...Nope, nope, it was definitely a helmet.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> So no. None of us wore hoods.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Well...maybe when we were out on an expedition and it rained, I guess... Still, though...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I see...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Master, what type of weapon did he use?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> A sword inlaid with gold and silver.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I couldn&#39;t see what it was at first...</p><hr><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...No. It can&#39;t be.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ???</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Do you have a minute, Master? I was rechecking the calculations on the Rayshift coordinates...</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> And I found some points that concern me. Actually, the one who made the discovery was Mr. Babbage.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Anyway, I&#39;m looking for Miss Da Vinci. Would you happen to know where she\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, Jekyll. Da Vinci should be in Lab 2.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Hey! We&#39;re talking about something important, you nerd! We didn&#39;t call you, and Da Vinci&#39;s not here either!</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Sorry. I didn&#39;t mean to interrupt... Hey! Ow, ow, ow!!!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Stop overreacting. I just gave you a little poke.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Ugh. This is why you&#39;re such a loser.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Well, that was actually... Ungh... No, never mind. Nothing. Haha.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong> Hey, Fujimaru. Good, good. Looks like you came back in one piece.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong> You Rayshifted out somewhere to get rid of a small Singularity, right? I heard all about it.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong> Sorry I couldn&#39;t help. So... Yeah. Make sure to take me with you next time, okay?</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong> You&#39;ll never get lost again with me around. I&#39;ve got good eyes.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I did get lost a bit...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> But it was an accident!</p><hr><p><strong>Arash:</strong> Haha. I see. Well, I&#39;m not blaming you or anything.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong> But, well, why don&#39;t you tell me about it? Hearing you tell me about your own travels might be nice for a change.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong> I actually want to hear, directly from you, who you met.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong> ...I knew it. You met HIM.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong> I get it. I guess this is what you would call fate.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong> I didn&#39;t think he was in the Throne of Heroes. No... He isn&#39;t... So? What&#39;s your take on it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Eh? Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Arash, what are you talking about?</p><hr><p><strong>Arash:</strong> Sorry for being so cryptic. My bad, Master. I&#39;m really not sure what to say...</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong> Umm...</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong> Well, I guess it&#39;s not entirely impossible. Yeah, yeah. Looks like I&#39;ll be able to enjoy my drink tonight!</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong> Hahahaha. So he&#39;s still out there, somewhere, fighting!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Explain!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What the heck!?</p><hr><p><strong>Arash:</strong> Haha! Come on, don&#39;t say that! Ha... But yeah...so it was him...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Arash!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (Stare at him silently)</p><hr><p><strong>Arash:</strong> ...O-okay.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong> Well, yeah. I know! If there&#39;s ever a chance, you&#39;ll see him again! Yeah!</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong> Hey, hey. Wait! Quit hitting me! It doesn&#39;t hurt, but for some reason I feel bad, like I did something wrong.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> What&#39;s going on, Arash? What, are you having your very own drinking party right in the middle of the hallway?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Oh hey. Master&#39;s here too. What&#39;s up?</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong> Ah, the Child of Light!</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong> Oh, it&#39;s nothing. Haha, this may actually have to do with you!</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong> You should keep this a secret from the pharaoh, the valkyrie lady, and the alchemist.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>--SECTION BREAK--</strong></p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> I thought there was something sinister this time around...but I don&#39;t sense the noxious gas of L or the lingering scent of R.</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> Things aren&#39;t going as planned. I guess I have no choice but to search more thoroughly.</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> Yeah. It&#39;ll be all right, Merlin. I will accomplish my goal, and then return to where I belong.</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> Soon. One of these days.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> A voice hailed me, asking me to wait.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Why? I turned around, surrounded by a field of golden grass.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I thought I had arrived at the place where I belonged. After all, by now my time as king was no more than a distant memory.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The time I spent fighting for Britain... Ten years of bravery and honor, charging from battlefield to battlefield with the Knights of the Round Table.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> And that&#39;s not all: even the time I spent living as a solitary knight after that...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...and yes, even that two-week-long Holy Grail War in the Far East at the end of the 20th century\u2013one fought over a false Grail...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...all for the sake of a girl who taught me things I never would have learned in my life as a king.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> All of it, no more than a distant memory now. That begs the question...</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> Why stop me now?</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> I just arrived here. I did what I needed to do, and ended everything.</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> I finally reached the place...the promised place. Just as the legend to be passed down through the ages said.</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> I thought I was going to form a contract with the world...</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> But that is not how it went. I got my answer, and then my life ended.</p><p><strong>Female Mage:</strong> ...Hehe.</p><p><strong>Female Mage:</strong> You have the appearance of a young man, yet you speak like an old man.</p><p><strong>Female Mage:</strong> No, I wonder. My king. Britain&#39;s eternal king and wielder of the sacred sword...</p><p><strong>Female Mage:</strong> There must be many things you have left undone. I&#39;m sure you know already, right?</p><p><strong>Female Mage:</strong> You have yet to truly and finally defeat that which you are destined to destroy.</p><p><strong>Female Mage:</strong> Once in 1991 A.D. Once more in 1999 A.D.</p><p><strong>Female Mage:</strong> Twice you struck it down, but that devourer of cities is persistent. It&#39;s not over yet.</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> That&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Female Mage:</strong> Hehehe. Yes, exactly!</p><p><strong>Female Mage:</strong> Great child of Uther... My beloved red dragon! That&#39;s right, this situation is terribly irregular!</p><p><strong>Female Mage:</strong> Yes, it is a state of emergency so severe, you were roped into this the instant you arrived at Avalon!</p><p><strong>Female Mage:</strong> It should have ended the second time. But somehow, it&#39;s back for round three! It&#39;s unfathomable!</p><p><strong>Female Mage:</strong> Hehe. Perhaps an Original Species awakened somewhere?</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Female Mage:</strong> Really, I must say! It&#39;s a truly rotten twist of fate! After all, you&#39;re not supposed to be here.</p><p><strong>Female Mage:</strong> Now&#39;s not the time for you to come knocking on my door. It can&#39;t be now. You&#39;re ten years too early.</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> Wait. Merlin, what are you talking\u2013</p><p><strong>Female Mage:</strong> You still need to continue your journey. Whether it be in your world, or in another universe.</p><p><strong>Female Mage:</strong> You may travel through dimensions or even phenomena. Anywho, yeah, hang in there.</p><p><strong>Female Mage:</strong> Why? How, you ask? Well... Yeah, I wonder... I can&#39;t say for sure.</p><p><strong>Female Mage:</strong> This could be a deep-seated curse put on you as the wielder of a sacred sword, or it could be something that was sprung on you right before a long break...</p><p><strong>Female Mage:</strong> ...It may be the great Grand Order.</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> ...Grand...Order...?</p><p><strong>Female Mage:</strong> Either way, you need to leave here immediately. And that&#39;s also why I stopped you. Listen...</p><p><strong>Female Mage:</strong> I&#39;m going to say this again: your journey has not ended.</p><p><strong>Female Mage:</strong> It can&#39;t end. For her sake as well.</p><p><strong>Female Mage:</strong> What did you feel from her? Light? Radiance? Affection? Or all of them?</p><p><strong>Female Mage:</strong> They might all end up in a whirlpool of gluttony. If you don&#39;t continue your journey, that is.</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> !!</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> Merlin, wait! Explain yourself! I&#39;ve been wondering about this for a while, but you&#39;re too cryptic!</p><p><strong>Female Mage:</strong> What the heck? That&#39;s mean. Oh well. Come on, hurry up and get going!</p><p><strong>Female Mage:</strong> You&#39;ll get to meet me face-to-face next time! This time, too bad!</p><p><strong>Female Mage:</strong> My king, the last Pendragon! May your new journey be blessed! We shall meet again!</p><p><strong>Female Mage:</strong> If you meet another me in a parallel universe, be kind to them!</p><p><strong>--SECTION BREAK--</strong></p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> I have yet to meet another you, Merlin, but I haven&#39;t forgotten what you said. For now.</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> ...This is yet another world that has gone to ruin.</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> Pruning Theoretical Phenomenon, was it? No, destruction and pruning have nothing to do with each other.</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> I suppose scenes like this are commonplace for any phenomenon that gets pruned.</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> The decay of a civilization... The destruction of a city... No matter how many times I see it, I still can&#39;t get used to it.</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> But then again...it&#39;s still too early for me to give up. Right, Merlin?</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> ...If only there were some survivors.</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> Hm?</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> !!</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> A person...out of nowhere!? You&#39;re...!?</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> You&#39;re that stranger I met earlier! So you&#39;re someone who can travel through time and space, too?</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> A-are you all right? It looked like you fell from a ways above the ground...</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> No, before you answer that, you need to know that this land&#39;s atmosphere is poisonous to living creatures!</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> Do you have a gas mask or a Mystic Code? If you don&#39;t, take one of my talismans.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...H-hello.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...My head&#39;s spinning.</p><hr><p><strong>Knight:</strong> ...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Where am I?</p><hr><p><strong>Knight:</strong> You&#39;ve awoken.</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> What a surprise. Well, there&#39;s no shortage of those today.</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> First, you appeared out of thin air. Second, you are somehow alive when the air is pure poison.</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> You&#39;re definitely full of surprises. But for the time being, as much as I&#39;m glad you woke up...</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> Let me ask you this first: Are you hurt anywhere?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m fine.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I don&#39;t think anything&#39;s broken.</p><hr><p><strong>Knight:</strong> I see. I&#39;m glad.</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> So...why did you come to a wasteland like this?</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> There&#39;s not much here. Actually, there are really only dangerous things here.</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> Do you make a habit of running headlong into danger?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Rayshif\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> U-uh... I mean, what was it again...?</p><hr><p><strong>Knight:</strong> I see.</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> You&#39;re either holding something back or your memory is fuzzy. I won&#39;t ask questions.</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> But, yeah. If you&#39;re falling from the sky from out of nowhere...</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> ...then you&#39;re not just some lost mage...at least this time around.</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> (Thinking back to what happened last time, could this child have gotten caught up in my warps?)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Did you say something?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I think I heard something...</p><hr><p><strong>Knight:</strong> Uh... Well, if I try to explain, it&#39;ll just complicate things. Sorry.</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> No, I should at least tell you what I can. Though the ruler of this land is sure to approach me soon...</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> Okay. We have at least some time to talk.</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> Let&#39;s begin with introductions. I failed to do so last time because I was in a hurry.</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> My name is Arthur Pendragon.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> I was the King of Britain in the past. But now I am a mere knight.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> I am not human like you. Do you understand that?</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> I&#39;m a Heroic Spi\u2013I am currently a Servant who possesses a Spirit Origin. Unfortunately, I have no Master.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> The wielder of the Sacred Sword of the Planet, Excalibur. Yes, my Noble Phantasm.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> The sacred sword...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> King Arthur!?</p><hr><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> What an unexpected reaction.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> ...Do you, by chance, know who I am?</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> I see... Chaldea... The Incineration of Humanity... The 21st century...</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> A female King Arthur...</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> And your name is Fujimaru. That has a nice ring to it.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> You were supposed to be able to communicate in real time with the Chaldea in 2019...</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> No, I believe you. Actually, many of my questions have been answered. You must have gone through some truly difficult battles.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> ...Yes, I can feel it.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> Being a Master to one Servant is tough enough, but to be able to form contracts with multiple Servants and keep battling...</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> Truly, that is an achievement that goes beyond imagining. No ordinary person could save the world, after all.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...You think so?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Thank you, King Arthur.</p><hr><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> You&#39;re amazing. You seem to have walked an even more treacherous path than I have.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> Unless you...</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> ...Ah. Maybe you...</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> He mentioned... So it was you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> He?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Who are you talking about?</p><hr><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> I don&#39;t really know the specific location or era. I was there for a very, very short time relative to the other places I&#39;ve visited.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> I warped before I could confirm his name. I couldn&#39;t even say goodbye to him.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> But... Yes, I still remember.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> I remember being able to see a large, red, iron bridge...</p><p><strong>--SECTION BREAK--</strong></p><p><strong>???:</strong> Well, yes. I don&#39;t mind if you think I am crazy.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> What I am about to tell you may seem unbelievable... It does not bear any weight especially in a peaceful country like this one.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I wouldn&#39;t want it to bear any weight anyway. Because even if it was true, there&#39;s nothing anyone can do about it.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> And of course it&#39;s difficult to accept...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> That&#39;s why...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I&#39;m going to talk while I imagine the astonished look on your face.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> If things continue as they are, the world will end.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> The world will be incinerated without ever seeing 2019. This has already been determined. It is a foregone conclusion.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...What do you think? Surprised?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Or do you think I&#39;m insane? Do I look like a pathetic man who&#39;s been possessed by some pessimistic delusion?</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> Of course not. I believe your words.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> Your eyes must see through everything. You&#39;re not the first person I&#39;ve met who has the power of Clairvoyance.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Thank you. Though I don&#39;t have powers of that sort.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Know this, O wandering king: even your sacred sword cannot prevent the future I saw.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> The Incineration of Humanity is simply too perfect of an achievement.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> But. But, you know...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> If by chance the world does not end in 2018... And if you can continue your wandering journey...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> You may be able to meet...</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> Meet you again? Here?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> No, not me.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> If by chance everything goes well, I will likely have met my end.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> But the person you&#39;re going to meet is someone I believe will become important to me as well.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Someone who could accomplish something I could never do...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Someone who carries love and hope... Someone who keeps aiming for tomorrow, for the sake of a yesterday that has been lost!</p><p><strong>--SECTION BREAK--</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Don&#39;t tell me that person is\u2014</p><hr><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> Hm...</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> ...It&#39;s getting near.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> I thought I could talk longer, but time&#39;s up. Looks like the ruler of this land is here.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> It&#39;s one of the sources of the decay of this time and age.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> Perhaps it&#39;s a Demonic Beast that somehow became corrupted. Or it could be a type of weapon that was created by someone and abandoned.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> Sorry to stop our talk midway. But then again, my story ends here anyway.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> Because right after that conversation, I warped somewhere else. I have no control over that.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> Nothing has changed. Regardless of what I want...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Your situation sounds a lot like Musashi&#39;s...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Wait. Was the person you were talking about earlier</p><hr><p><strong>Beast:</strong> [[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]!</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> ...Bloodlust, hostility, malice. Nothing else, huh?</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> An incarnation of massacre. A device of destruction that cannot stop itself. It may not be a Beast, but it is still evil.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> You are not the Beast I am searching for. But you are still my enemy.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> I&#39;m sorry, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> It&#39;s time to battle. I&#39;m sure our opponent will come at us with everything it has, so I cannot hold back.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> I&#39;m sorry for dragging you into this. I will protect you with all my strength. But if it&#39;s at all possible...</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> If I could ask... No, would you like to fight alongside me?</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> The one who fights to save the world. You, the one to whom that man entrusted everything...</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> I want to engrave the sight of you into my memory once again!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Got it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> And in exchange, you need to finish your story!</p><hr><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> Okay, that&#39;s a promise!</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> Let&#39;s go. For now, you shall be my Master!</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> There&#39;s no need to be connected through Command Spells. You only need to show me your resolve to save the world!</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> And to go along with your dazzling actions, I shall show you the light of this planet!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> ...We&#39;re done. Good work.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> It wasn&#39;t the Beast I was looking for, but at the very least, its death should halt this place&#39;s deterioration.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> I&#39;m not entirely clear on how all this works. But apparently this is what my journey entails.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> King Arthur, you promised.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Please continue your story.</p><hr><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> Oh, right. There&#39;s something I need to tell you.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> The man I met and conversed with...</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> His name was Rom\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, thank goodness! We finally connected! Scanning your vital signs in three...two...one!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Scanning... Okay, all done! Good, looks like nothing is wrong with your body!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I will begin preparations to bring you back immediately! Please hold still, Senpai!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Communication is back up!?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...Uh, ahem. Hey. It&#39;s me, Da Vinci.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> There was a...tiny snafu in the program that handles the Rayshift coordinate calculations.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It wasn&#39;t a mistake that just developed out of nowhere. It was there from the beginning. Let&#39;s just say that there was a shortcoming in one of the formulae.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The result itself doesn&#39;t change. But yeah, it&#39;s a bug.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That&#39;s what was causing all the problems. It was Rayshifting you, and only you, to weird coordinates.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Anyway, simply put, it was just a bug. I&#39;m sorry, really! It wasn&#39;t that I made any mistakes in the design stage; it was just me being negligent as a manager!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Oh, and it&#39;s not Romani&#39;s fault either. It&#39;s my fault, since it&#39;s all under my jurisdiction. I&#39;m really sorry!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Babbage was the one who found it after doing some calculations because he had nothing better to do. I guess you really can&#39;t give those analog folks flak.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I see... I mean, wait a minute!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;m in the middle of talking to King Arthur!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um, do you mean Altria...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m only detecting you there. Is...another Servant with you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Eh?</p><hr><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> ...Seems like they cannot see me. Perhaps my Spirit Origin does not exist in your world.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> If the King Arthur you know is female, that means she&#39;s me, but not me.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> I don&#39;t exist. At least not in your world&#39;s history.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> You may need to ask Merlin for details, but yeah.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> I&#39;m sure that&#39;s what it is.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> ...Oh, or maybe it&#39;s because my warp has already started?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Wait!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You were about to tell me a name...!</p><hr><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> You should already know. It&#39;s the same name that the beautiful lady mentioned just now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So it was Romani Archaman...!</p><hr><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> Yes, that&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> I firmly believe that the person he was talking about was you.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> How is he doing now? ...No, I shouldn&#39;t ask. At least not right now. Not now.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> That&#39;s why, Fujimaru...</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> Instead of saying goodbye, let me say this:</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> I&#39;m glad I met you, brave child, savior of the planet under a distant sky.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> You, who inherited the will of the man I encountered during my journey.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> May your perilous journey be blessed, Fujimaru! And when we meet again under the same sky, someday, someplace...</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> Let us fight alongside each other again.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> To save your world. To save tomorrow.</p><p><strong>--SECTION BREAK--</strong></p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hm? What is it, Doctor?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hehe. I don&#39;t have as much free time as before. You see, everyone realized how useful I am.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That&#39;s why I&#39;m super busy every day. I mean, think we&#39;re taking too much of the burden of Chaldea&#39;s future onto ourselves?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But that&#39;s just me complaining. Though, I don&#39;t mind sparing some time to listen to you talk.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...Hm? Would I be okay with just idle chitchat or gossip?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yeah, sure. I&#39;m just going to work while I listen. Now come on, talk to me.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Uh-huh. Oh. I see. Ah.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yeah, I guess so. Yeah. Yep.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...Eh? What? What did you just say?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Before that. The thing you said before that. Something about a thing near the bridge in Fuyuki City.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...You&#39;ve met the male King Arthur? Was he a Heroic Spirit? When?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Before Chaldea&#39;s Summoning System was established? But that&#39;s impossible. How long ago was that?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Either way, that was after Fuyuki&#39;s Grail War ended, right? Even with a tremendous amount of spiritual evocation and other powerful ceremonial magecraft...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Summoning a Heroic Spirit that can converse coherently would be impossible.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Besides...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hm. Wait. Something&#39;s not right.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> If what you&#39;re saying is true, it must be because of that! The Singularity in Fuyuki! The Greater Grail!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> So that reaction you had when you first saw the female King Arthur on the monitor was...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...Eh?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You forgot? Completely?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...Yeah, I don&#39;t blame you. If a random man calling himself King Arthur came up to you, no one would give it much credence.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Nobody would think, \u201CWhoa, it&#39;s the real King Arthur!\u201D And I&#39;m sure he wouldn&#39;t stick out in your memory. But then again...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You have your position to think about. You&#39;re in Chaldea, after all.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...Oh. I see.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You say that, but the expression on your face tells me you&#39;re fondly thinking back on that day, Romani.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It&#39;s nothing to be embarrassed about. Heh heh. Oh, let me guess.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I bet you said something really embarrassing!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Am I right?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hahahaha. Nope. Can&#39;t do that. You can&#39;t say you were kidding after that reaction! There&#39;s no fooling me!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Just give up and tell me everything! Come on, I won&#39;t judge!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It&#39;ll be all right. So what did you tell him?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Eh? You made a wish? To the King Arthur you saw in Fuyuki?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> What did you wish for...?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> No. Yeah. It&#39;ll be much more interesting if you don&#39;t tell me right now.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Maybe tell me tomorrow... Or maybe someday far from now...</p>',504),a=[s];function g(i,h){return o(),r("div",null,a)}var u=t(n,[["render",g],["__file","Arthur.html.vue"]]);export{u as default};
