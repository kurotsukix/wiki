It&#39;s only natural that a genius like myself would become a Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...So much for our parting in Rome. I see your perfect confidence remains unchanged, Emperor...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. But I&#39;m happy about this reunion. I look forward to working with you Nero.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m looking forward to it as well.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Umu! But now I&#39;m your Servant, not your Emperor. From now on call me &quot;Red Saber!&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Even as a Heroic Spirit, you&#39;re still short.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> F-Fool! I am not &quot;short!&quot; This is my perfect form! I have no problem with my height.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> ...N-No problem at all! I don&#39;t feel bitter about my height! Not one bit!</p><hr><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Oops, I guess this wasn&#39;t the time to chit chat.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Ahem, Mages of Chaldea who strive to save humanity.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> May that battle be an impossible battle in a distant past, I have not forgotten your efforts.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> You have my gratitude. I owe you Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Umu\u2014And I am going to owe you this time too! Get the ships out! It&#39;s time for me to depart with my Master!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Yes, the weather is clear, and the waves are high. We&#39;ll arrive in no time!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> \u2014Hmm?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Nero:</strong> What&#39;re you gaping at? We&#39;ve come this far, just grant my wish already!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Look at Mash, she blends in perfectly. There she is, brooding on the deck. Hmm, why are her eyes so lifeless?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai... I see that Nero... I mean, Red Saber, is even pushier...than...before...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You put us all on a boat before we have any idea what&#39;s going on...and come...all this way...Ugh.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh...Motion sickness medicine. Thank you, Fou... Red Saber&#39;s steering is horrifyin...Ugh.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> There it is! Our destination, the island of buried mysteries!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> They call it the &quot;Bermuda Triangle&quot; or something?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> They use that name to refer to these waters, but don&#39;t worry about it. On board Fujimaru, Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Why?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Give us a reason!</p><hr><p><strong>Nero:</strong> It&#39;s an &quot;island of buried mysteries.&quot; Obviously,\u2014 it&#39;s treasure-hunting time!</p><p><strong>Golem:</strong><span style="font-size:25px;">GoAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\u2014!</span></p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong> Take that!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Thank you for your warm welcome!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> But, you&#39;re in my way. Come again after you&#39;ve made yourself five times more beautiful!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master! I have no clue what she&#39;s talking about, but for now, let&#39;s fight!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> That was a good warm-up. How was I? My sword skills haven&#39;t gotten worse, have they?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> They&#39;re much improved and will come in handy...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Haha! I know, right? I know, right! You&#39;re an honest girl, Mash! I like you!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Anyway, I&#39;ll start the search. According to my intuition... Umu, we should go this way!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> There she goes on her own again... Let&#39;s go after her, Master!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> We&#39;ve got ourselves a werebeast! Hmm, I&#39;m worried about the smell of gunpowder, but whatever!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Let&#39;s go, Fujimaru! We&#39;re going to beat these guys and get the treasure!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Now that the annoyances are out of our way. Mash, go ahead and open the treasure chest.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> I&#39;m sure there&#39;s tons of wonderful treasure in there\u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I have unfortunate news, Your Majesty. Please look inside.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Hey\u2014There&#39;s nothing in here? Is this a...pelican?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I&#39;m not sure. It looks like a penguin to me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Looks like someone beat us here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Guess it was too good to be true.</p><hr><p><strong>Nero:</strong> This sucks! But it wasn&#39;t such a waste of time after all!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> If you look closely, there&#39;s some stuff left in here. Whoever came before us must be a careless fool!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Okay, we&#39;re going to take this and have a triumphant return! Good work Fujimaru, Mash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um... Well, that&#39;s fine, but why?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I don&#39;t see why an emperor would really need any treasure.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> ...Umu, with my Golden Rule I wouldn&#39;t have to worry about money, but I need more capital right now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> More capital?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> For what reason?</p><hr><p><strong>Nero:</strong> That&#39;s a secret, of course! You&#39;ll find out eventually, so look forward to it!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...You heard her, Senpai. It seems that Her Majesty has some sort of grand plan.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Anyway, let&#39;s collect some resources that we might be able to use. There&#39;s some Saint Quartz!</p><h2 id="a-golden-business" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#a-golden-business" aria-hidden="true">#</a> A Golden Business</h2><p><strong>Nero:</strong> The time is now. I shall start the grand enterprise that I&#39;ve been planning for a long time.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> However, to make something perfect, you need unparalleled talent and resolve.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Don&#39;t you think so, Fujimaru? You should understand my suffering.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (Senpai. I think Red Saber is trying to talk to you.)</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> (These questions can be a headache. Let&#39;s just give her a random answer.)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> O-Of course I understand.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I don&#39;t get it at all.</p><hr><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Umu! I knew you&#39;d get it right away. Thanks to you, I&#39;ve made up my mind.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> We&#39;re going to rebuild the Domus Aurea! My Noble Phantasm and the essence of my artist&#39;s soul\u2014</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> In any event, we&#39;ve come to the plains in search of the last required piece. Lend me a hand, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> We need to be careful with money. Rebuilding the Golden Theater will be costly.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> The materials, personnel, and my design fees! This time, let&#39;s try to do something about the material costs.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> She&#39;s trying to improve her Noble Phantasm with money... Not a lot of Heroic Spirits would do that.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> So that&#39;s why you were trying to gather treasure before. But Your Majesty, can you strengthen your Noble Phantasm like that?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Of course. The Golden Theater I created with my magical energy is based off the original that existed.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> It&#39;s a matter of the image that&#39;s in my mind when I activate my Noble Phantasm. If we renovate the theater, I can sear that image in my mind.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> That way, when I use my Noble Phantasm it should be just as extravagant and even more dazzling. That&#39;s the plan, anyway.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I see. So her Noble Phantasm depends on the power of her imagination.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The more grand that Theater becomes, the more real the image becomes for Red Saber.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I think it&#39;s already real enough, but...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Haha, don&#39;t compliment me now, Fujimaru. You&#39;re so cute. Compliment me later.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You&#39;re going to wear yourself out.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Dummy! Pushing yourself and pretending is the same thing! What&#39;s the point of not trying your best?</p><hr><p><strong>Nero:</strong> In any event, the final material should appear soon. Everyone get ready for combat. This is going to be tough?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ??? It&#39;s going to appear?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Just what are you going to have us make?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Isn&#39;t it obvious? A colosseum of sorts.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Umu, a new Golden Theater. A mix between a theater and a colosseum, a completely new way to watch someone fight.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> ...Well, there won&#39;t be any fighting in the Theater. I&#39;m just going to make the entrance look like the Colosseum.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Do you guys know what Colosseum means?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I think it was...Oh, I remember. It means &quot;Before the Giant Statue.&quot;</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> That&#39;s right. It came from the word &quot;colossus.&quot;</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> There&#39;s a giant statue in front of the Colosseum in Rome that watches over the spectators.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> \u2014Oh, that&#39;s right. It was around the time of Emperor Nero when that colosseum\u2014</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> That&#39;s right! It was a statue of me! It&#39;s 31 meters high. It was a beautiful statue.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Though when the Colosseum was built my Theater was destroyed, but let&#39;s not talk about that.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> In any event, this time I&#39;m after\u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master, we&#39;ve got hostiles! Oh, no\u2014There&#39;s a bunch of golems closing in!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Nero, this couldn&#39;t be your\u2014</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Umu. I used my patrons to drive the golems here to use as material!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Let&#39;s do this, Fujimaru! It&#39;s the spring of golem hunting!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We&#39;ve taken out the enemy golems... The battle is over...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Kyuu...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> What a primitive way of fighting... To pummel the gates physically...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> U-Umu, this went too far. I&#39;ve realized my mistake here...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> But with this much material here, let&#39;s start building! I&#39;ll show you how mankind first started using concrete!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> In what pose will you build the statue?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Hm...I have to think about that...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I want to build a statue of Mash, too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> N-No, that&#39;s quite okay, Senpai!</p><hr><p><strong>Nero:</strong> ...Sorry. I&#39;ll build the statue later. These golems make for good materials, but...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> They just don&#39;t have the right appeal. The voices I hear from the stones are the brawny types.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> I can&#39;t carve a good statue with this. I&#39;ve given up on the Colosseum style this time.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> But I will rebuild the Theater. Don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t waste your effort Master.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Now it&#39;s time to really get to work! Let&#39;s get the materials together and make our triumphant return to Rome!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> We&#39;re going to make my Theater strong, firm, and as tough as a fortress...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> That&#39;s right, something Heracles can&#39;t even handle. The strongest Theater yet!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> This emperor hasn&#39;t learned anything!</p><h2 id="no-matter-how-many-times-the-end-comes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#no-matter-how-many-times-the-end-comes" aria-hidden="true">#</a> No Matter How Many Times the End Comes</h2><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Sorry about that Fujimaru. I have some personal business I need your help with.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> ...The United Empire is gone, and Rome is in an ephemeral peace.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> However, the one who led Rome as its first citizen, Nero Claudius is no longer there.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Rather, the human &quot;Nero&quot; is no longer there because I contracted with you, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> The human &quot;Nero&quot; already left Rome just like in history. Now &quot;I&quot; sit as its Emperor.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The Era&#39;s ability to bring back the past... No, to repair itself.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> As long as the Servant Nero is here, the Emperor Nero must be dead.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> In normal space and time, both the human before death and the Servant after death can exist simultaneously.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But in a Singularity, &quot;what&#39;s accurate&quot; and &quot;what&#39;s stronger&quot; ends up taking precedence.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Once the Heroic Spirit Nero contracted with you, the Nero at Septem became this Nero, unfortunately.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You didn&#39;t have to say &quot;unfortunately,&quot; Mash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...My apologies.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I wasn&#39;t trying to criticize you... Sorry about that, Emperor Nero.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> It&#39;s fine. You were just lamenting the fact that I passed away, correct?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> If that&#39;s the case, I forgive you. Actually, I&#39;m happy. You mourned me, even though I was called a tyrant.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Is that bad?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, sorry about that Emperor Nero.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Well, it&#39;s a confusing problem, so I ended up using a negative expression...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Emperor Nero, no...Nero. You are definitely here in Rome.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I am happy about such fortune, Emperor.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Umu, you&#39;re a really nice girl, Mash!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> You feel regret for your mistakes, and feel happy when good things happen.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> I&#39;ll forgive what you said with that smile of yours. You can accompany me to a bath later as an apology!</p><hr><p><strong>Nero:</strong> ...Oh, not good. I always get carried away when Fujimaru is around.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> There&#39;s only one reason why we&#39;ve come to Septem. I want you to help me, Master.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Remember when I brought out a boat last time? I heard a little something during the voyage.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Supposedly there&#39;s a ghost that appears in the cursed deserts on the outskirts of Rome.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> I think I might know who that ghost is.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Right now, I&#39;m carrying out my royal duties as a Servant, but I&#39;m not sure when I&#39;ll finish them and disappear.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> That&#39;s why before that happens... I want to ease Rome&#39;s pain with my own two hands.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;d love to help.</p><hr><p><strong>Nero:</strong> \u2014Umu. I am counting on you, one who contracted with me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...The sun&#39;s gone down, Master. It&#39;s a familiar scene, but it feels lonely here...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...It&#39;s like no one&#39;s here. A stage everyone&#39;s forgotten about...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Is it really around here?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What did you mean you think you know who it is?</p><hr><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Umu, it should be around here. The shape of the rocks, the sound of the wind, the faded color of the setting sun...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> I remember it all, even now. The fate of an emperor who died here, in these wastelands.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> \u2014! Nero, is this\u2014</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Umu. This is where I died. Nero Claudius slit her own throat here.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Nero loved the people and she continually showed her burning passion...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> However, it wasn&#39;t the warm love people knew of.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Nero only knew how to love one way. To demand, give, and burn away... Violently.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> It was like forcing people to do things, you may say. Nero didn&#39;t realize even until her end, that her actions were like poison to the people.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Nero made a mistake that weakened her own position, and was chased away from her throne by the senate.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> The army turned against her, but even then she believed that the people she loved so passionately would defend her.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> ...I don&#39;t think I need to tell you what happened. The people didn&#39;t defend the foolish tyrant.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Although Nero escaped from her pursuers, she chose to end her life out of grief.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> \u2014I can&#39;t say what Nero was grieving over. Just that her life ended here.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> But...Nero didn&#39;t die that easily.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Or more like she couldn&#39;t die, rather. She couldn&#39;t breathe. Her heart ached. Her eyes burned.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> It was like being driven to madness by a never-ending fever.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Three days passed and Nero still wasn&#39;t discovered by her pursuers.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> She woke at sunset each day, for she thought she heard people calling out her name.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> It was the sound of the people that she loved. She knew they didn&#39;t blame Emperor Nero. That they were praising her.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Haha, talk about adding insult to injury. That couldn&#39;t have been, it just couldn&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Even so... Nero awoke, just to verify what she heard.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> At the first sunset, she sniffed her nose to an illusion. At the second sunset, she bit her lips to the inaudible calls.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> And at the third sunset\u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...That&#39;s right. Emperor Nero said her last words.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A soldier found her body, exposed in the wilderness, and out of pity, covered her with a cloth.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> At that moment, Emperor Nero opened her eyes and said: &quot;Too late, but how noble of you.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Umu, my fate ended there.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> I don&#39;t know what Nero was thinking at the very end.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> But Nero was okay with that. Even if it wasn&#39;t by the people she loved so much\u2014</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> The tyrant was happy that her life ended with the warmth of a human.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> That&#39;s the deus ex machina that I dream of even now.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Because no matter what happened, it was that very miracle which made the story a happy ending.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> If that soldier hadn&#39;t come along, I would have still been waiting in the wilderness for the impossible.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> And that is why! Why I must kill you!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> A tyrant&#39;s wandering dream! The reflection of a flower that forgot how to wither!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> The ghost of mine that cannot accept this end! Show yourself and take up your sword!</p><p><strong>Ghost:</strong> \u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A collection of powerful magical energy? What is this\u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s not the shadow of a Servant, nor its ghost... it&#39;s like the Demon God\u2014</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> The Fifth Emperor, Nero Claudius, implores you! My Master, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Lend me your strength! I might be a bit late, but\u2014 I shall right my wrongs with my own sword!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Leave it to me, Nero!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Gladly, Your Majesty!</p><hr><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> You idiot! How could an actor refuse to let the curtain go down?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> We thrive, and then perish! We cannot avoid death! The ending cannot be changed!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> That is why we sing! That is why we scream!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> I neither give up on, nor lament what I love! No matter how many times that final curtain comes down!</p><p><strong>Ghost:</strong> ...Oh...I can hear it... The call from the capital... The sixth...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> ...Farewell. The girl who never went back to being &quot;me.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Nero...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What do you mean &quot;me&quot;?</p><hr><p><strong>Nero:</strong> ...Umu. Worthless mumbles to myself. Don&#39;t worry about it.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> In any event\u2014</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> That was wonderful, Fujimaru. I expected nothing less from you! I knew you were dependable!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Thanks to you, that which disturbed Rome... No, it didn&#39;t disturb Rome actually, it was being ignored by Rome...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> I feel lonely now. I think I could get depressed here...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> No, that&#39;s not it. The people were just being nice and pretending they didn&#39;t see me!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> That&#39;s the Roman citizens and Nero for you! They&#39;re the best!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Just how positive can you be?!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Such a display of strength!</p><hr><p><strong>Nero:</strong> How could I serve as an emperor otherwise? If you have a little hope, you can laugh.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> That&#39;s how I live! No matter how may many times I fall, I&#39;ll get back up again!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> I&#39;ll show you that next time Mash, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> I was victorious because of you all. I&#39;ll show you my thanks on the battlefield.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Anyway, let&#39;s get back to Chaldea, Master!
