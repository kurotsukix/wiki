You have a good intuition, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Altera:</strong> I can&#39;t be certain, but I can guess to a certain level.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> This is\u2014&quot;inside of me.&quot;</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> It&#39;s not something physical, but psychological.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> Inside of me. I still can&#39;t say that for sure, but it&#39;s my memory. Of me, who fought as the great King of Huns.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> ...Inside of the memory of myself &quot;as a hero.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> As a hero?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I don&#39;t really get what you mean</p><hr><p><strong>Altera:</strong> It means exactly what I said. The memory of &quot;me,&quot; who was once called King of Destruction, Attila.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> One who kept on destroying every civilization like a thoughtless, wordless machine.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> It&#39;s my memory. That&#39;s why in here...</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> ...there&#39;s nothing.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> I didn&#39;t think &quot;like a human being.&quot; I didn&#39;t feel like one either.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> I couldn&#39;t think, and couldn&#39;t feel.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> ...To you, what do I look like?</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> To me, only the sky and the earth stretch endlessly. It&#39;s the end of a star that was leveled with no feeling or purpose.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> To you...I suppose, it looks like a view &quot;closest&quot; to what you&#39;ve seen.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> How you see it might be different, but this dark wasteland is indeed me.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> Even though I&#39;m supposed to be looking at my memory, I see nothing. No friends, and no family...</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> I can&#39;t hear anyone&#39;s voice. Nothing but gusty winds.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> ...Heh, talk about empty.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> Despite the fact I&#39;ve led many into battle, how come not even a single person is in my memory.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I think it&#39;s quiet.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> This is pretty calming.</p><hr><p><strong>Altera:</strong> You&#39;re kind.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> Well, I suppose that&#39;s how people would call someone like you, kind.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> I never...</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> ...I never wished to destroy lives. Still, I always kept destroying civilizations far as the eyes can see.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> You see the contradiction? I can&#39;t help myself from choosing this way.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> I deviate from this planet&#39;s absolute principle\u2014 that its purpose of survival is breeding.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> &quot;Destruction&quot; is implanted deep within my heart. I don&#39;t want to willingly kill, but I want to destroy.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> As a result people die. I killed many of them. The earth was always soaked with blood.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> ...However. What is left for me is this dark wilderness...</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> Look\u2013 it&#39;s coming.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> \u2014</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> I said there&#39;s nothing, but well, it wasn&#39;t true.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> I&#39;ve got ones like them. Those who have unclear names, with no faces.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> Those whom I fought against and killed. I simply fought and killed without recognizing them as individuals.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> Now it&#39;s time to use your power, Master. Though only if that summoning system of your works.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> You have no choice but to fight, if you don&#39;t want to die.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> ...I&#39;m not sure if death exists in this place, though.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> Splendid job, Master. You managed to stay alive because of the summoning system.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...This is a dream, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I feel like I am using a lot of magical energy.</p><hr><p><strong>Altera:</strong> This indeed is a dream, but our minds here are real.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> Magical energy exists as a link between your mind and body, right? In that case, it&#39;s only natural you use it.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> Have you used it all up yet? No, that&#39;s good to hear. You see, it&#39;s not over yet.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> \u2014</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> ...This time, it doesn&#39;t even look like a human.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> I wonder what that was. I feel like I have a dim memory of having killed a monster.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> Or, maybe that is formed by some sort of concept?</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> Whatever that is\u2013</p><p><strong>???:</strong> \u2014!!!</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> ...Hmm. For a mere concept, I see it&#39;s ready to kill.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> ...I&#39;m so ashamed I could pass out. I can&#39;t believe I even envy such a thing.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> Feelings, emotions. Things that I lacked, but now gained.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> However, I can&#39;t control these feelings well. I&#39;ve understood joy, but I don&#39;t how to express it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> L-Let&#39;s just focus on the monster before us!</p><hr><p><strong>Altera:</strong> Of course, you know your priorities, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I think you&#39;re just awkward.</p><hr><p><strong>Altera:</strong> ...That&#39;s a problem. Many of my allies would tell me that back then.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> It makes me happy, but I&#39;m sad. I really wish it was true.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> At any rate, we need to defeat that thing first. Come on Master, try to pull it off again.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> You&#39;ll actually die if you die here. If that happens, our contract will end.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> I&#39;ll be free from this subordination, and you&#39;ll be free from life.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> But that won&#39;t be fun. So, try not to die.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> I&#39;d like to talk to you just a little longer.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> ...I&#39;m impressed, Master.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> I have a better opinion of you. I expected you&#39;d stand frozen or something.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> Apparently I underestimated your way of existence Fujimaru, the one trying to save the world.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> ...It&#39;s time for you to go back. This place isn&#39;t appropriate for you to stay long.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> It only needs me. This place\u2013</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> \u2013This darkness, belongs to &quot;me&quot;.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Good morning, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You didn&#39;t come out at the scheduled time, so I came to see how you were doing\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But I can see that you overslept. Are you okay? You seemed to be troubled by your dream.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It wasn&#39;t a bad dream.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I was fighting a real battle.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Is that...so? If you don&#39;t mind, can you tell me more...no, it&#39;s nothing.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Breakfast is ready. Let&#39;s go, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, Foooou!</p><h2 id="my-memories" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#my-memories" aria-hidden="true">#</a> My Memories</h2><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Hmm\u2014</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Based on my observation, I couldn&#39;t detect anything. Um, maybe I should expand the range?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Hmmm, you are in 1st century Gaul, within the second singularity that&#39;s being corrected.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Are you sure it&#39;s around here, great hero of destruction, Attila\u2014I mean, Altera?</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> Don&#39;t call me Attila. Yes, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s around here.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> Someone is calling me here. I&#39;m certain that I felt it.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> It&#39;s a destructive...impulse. What&#39;s worse, it&#39;s extraordinary.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> Even if it destroys everything in sight, it still won&#39;t calm down... That&#39;s what it is.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> An impulse, huh? I don&#39;t know how to understand a phenomenon that can&#39;t be observed with numbers.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> She probably meant she sensed something similar to that of magical energy.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> Magical energy, hmm? I see, I won&#39;t deny that, but...</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> It&#39;s more like a forced command, one more powerful than Command Spells. That&#39;s what I&#39;ve sensed.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Are you sure about that?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, I am wondering the same.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Forced command, huh...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Right. It might be best for us to be prepared for combat.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, Fou Fooou!</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> It seems like it is already approaching us. A collection of destructive impulses.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s a Servant! If we&#39;re just picking that up now, that means...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...it&#39;s hiding in spirit form until our arrival! Senpai!</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> ...I am troubled.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> Oh, no... See, I knew it. I am troubled because of it...</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> I can smell that person... No wait, it&#39;s a smell similar to that person...</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> Why do I sense it? Why do I think like this?</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> ...That woman...</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> She must be one of the women... Who tried to get close to my...Sigurd...</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> Oh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You&#39;re Brynhild...right? A woman who tried to get close to your Sigurd? Who are you talking about?</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> She&#39;s looking at me. So that destructive impulse is directed to me.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> But I don&#39;t remember anyone named Sigurd. Hm...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ah! No, Altera, try to remember!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> How do I explain this... It&#39;s not Sigurd per se, but someone who shares the same origin and legend as him...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You&#39;ve already met him, Altera. That&#39;s right, this has happened before...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Wait, I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m getting confused so let me get this straight.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> In other words...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Siegfried and Altera married &quot;the same woman?&quot;</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Yes, that&#39;s right. After I died, my wife Kriemhild remarried Etzel\u2013</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> In other words, the great king of the Huns. I heard that the great king also lost his wife.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> Kriemhild...</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> My wife, huh? Wife...</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> Wife...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Don&#39;t you remember?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I didn&#39;t know you had a wife.</p><hr><p><strong>Altera:</strong> I&#39;m familiar with her name, but it feels unrealistic to have a wife.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> I know nothing except for war and destruction. I never directed my attention to anything else.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> So...it&#39;s possible that woman was there for me.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Oh I see, one of Altera&#39;s retainers probably played it smart and had them married for diplomatic reasons.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> How business-like...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Oh, I-I see.</p><hr><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> ...I do have some thoughts on that, but this is not the place to talk about it.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> I heard Kriemhild used King Etzel for her revenge.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> What led her to seek revenge was my death. So, I&#39;m in no position to accuse the king.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> Etzel\u2013</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou?</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> Etzel, huh\u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What&#39;s the matter, Altera?</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> Well, the name Etzel isn&#39;t bad.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It does sound cute.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I think the name fits you.</p><hr><p><strong>Altera:</strong> ...It&#39;s not...what I meant. It&#39;s not...</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> It&#39;s not that.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> (Seems like it is.)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (Yes, it is.)</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> (Indeed.)</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> (Fou, Fou Fou\u266A)</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> ...It&#39;s not...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Do you remember now?</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> Indeed, I do. But I suppose he is a different existence, or hero, than Sigurd.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> Siegfried and Sigurd. I hear both of them are heroes with the same origin...</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> Oh... Oh my...how can that be?</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> That&#39;s exactly what I thought. Taking...a wife... There&#39;s no way it can be...</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> \u2014Forgiven.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s not getting through to her!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Whoa, this seems dangerous!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Y-Yes, Senpai! She&#39;s obviously gone into battle mode!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> What, a Servant battle!? Now?</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> ...Fight me with everything you have.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> Hmm, she wishes to fight.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> Very well, I shall answer that wish. All I can do is wield the sword of destruction.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> Come. The sword of Mars shall crush you\u2014!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> ...Oh... What...was I...doing?</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> Don&#39;t tell me... Was I fighting? Me? Against you?</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> I-I see, so that&#39;s what happened. I wonder why...</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> It&#39;s odd. Sometimes I attack men, but usually not women.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It sounds horrible, but yes, most of Brynhild&#39;s victims are men.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Her Noble Phantasm feels like it&#39;s that way, too\u2013 E-Either way, I am happy we could clear up that misunderstanding!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Y-Yes. It was just a matter of pressing the wrong button!</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> Hmm...</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> Oh?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, Fou...</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> ...Anyway, I was lucky to fight such a powerful individual.

So you...remember that.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> How strange... Or perhaps not. I have come to understand that human memories are unpredictable.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> I may be repeating myself, but I shall explain the bare minimum...</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> We are within my memories. The memory that equates to a dark wasteland.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> Regardless, this place has nothing of value.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> To rephrase, this is the memory of my birth.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> If this dark wasteland was formed using memories of my life...</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> ...then my life was...</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> No, this place was given shape by memories created before I walked my so-called life.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Is this your birthplace?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Were you born here?</p><hr><p><strong>Altera:</strong> This is where I was discovered, where I awakened\u2014this cave.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> A darkened ruin. Remnants of a civilization thousands of years ago...or so I hear.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> How do you see it? I can only see it as a dark cave...</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> This is an ancient ruin left in the Sahara Desert. Within, the Hun elders sought me out.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> To be exact, I was not born a Hun.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> But the ones who raised me and made me into their king were undoubtedly the Hun elders.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> In my youth, after killing a soldier for the first time, I was told...</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> ...That I exist to fight.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> This crest of war on my flesh, and this sword of the War God... I had them from the very beginning.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> I had no father or mother. I was simply discovered by the descendants of the Huns.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> I was asked to become destruction itself. So...</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> That is what I did. I became destruction incarnate.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> ...I did not want to kill. Yet I did not and still do not understand the so-called value of life.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> I do not know many things. Oh, how I do not know so very much of this world&#39;s matters.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> If things are taken, broken, killed...what becomes of it?</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> These things simply vanish from this land for eternity.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> It&#39;s simple.
