Again? Where are they from?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> They seem to have directly entered from a different phase space. But this response? I wonder what this is.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Doctor, is it an emergency? Oh, Senpai, good morning.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You look cheerful again today.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, of course. It&#39;s good to be cheerful. I also had a delicious breakfast today.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I think you&#39;re acting a little too calm! Greetings are important, but for now, intruder!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What was breakfast?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Fried eggs, seaweed, and miso soup, with stewed pumpkins for dessert.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Even rationing out what little we have stored, I believe this was a frugal yet complete meal.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Pumpkin, huh. We did harvest a lot, so there is an excess of them.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> No wait! Intruder, the intruder!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh my, I&#39;ll go intercept them right away. Senpai, please do the honors.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The response was from around here...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Mash, behind you!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Wh\u2013?</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong> Nobu nobuu!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ?!?!?!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Wha\u2013?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Huh?</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong> Nobu nobuu!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What is this thing?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Be careful, Mash. It may look like a joke, but it&#39;s displaying high combat capabilities.</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong> Nobbuu!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master! Look out!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> Stop right there!</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong> Nobu!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> W-Who are you?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> Nice to meet you. I&#39;m from Shinsen\u2013 Uh... Let&#39;s see... Just call me Sakura Saber.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Sakura... Saber?</p><p><strong>Sakura Saber:</strong> Yes. I materialized in this world to pursue that mysterious creature...</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> Wait, wait, man-slayer! Don&#39;t leave me behind!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> Sheesh, my normal self could take them out like it was nothing, but this is rather hard on me...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> U-Um, the two of you are?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> Hmm? Me? I am the Demon King of the Sixth Heaven, Nobu\u2013 No, Demon, right! I&#39;m Demon Archer!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Demon Archer and Sakura Saber... I see.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> If I could interrupt, I figured out where that thing spawned. It&#39;s a different phase space that collided with Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> We have to destroy the source of the problem. Or else, Chaldea will be filled with strange creatures.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I finished calculating the coordinates for the Rayshift. Go in there and get rid of them quick!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Understood! I&#39;ll hurry over with Senpai! Um, by the way, what will you two do?</p><p><strong>Sakura Saber:</strong> We&#39;re hoping to do the same thing you&#39;re trying to do. Please let us come along with you.</p><p><strong>Sakura Saber:</strong> If that&#39;s okay with you? Archer?</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong> All right, all right. Well, it is our problem and I&#39;ve grown tired of chasing after them...</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong> Very well! The Demon King of the Sixth Heaven, Demon Archer will lend you a hand!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Anyway, once you all Rayshift, I&#39;ll lock the system down.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> There. Now we can have some peace of mind.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> By the way, those two Servants... How did they directly materialize into Chaldea?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hmm, it looks like we got connected to a strange space by an astronomical probability.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Look at the conditions they&#39;re Rayshifting into. What&#39;s this? Phenomena Corruption from another phase space?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> In any case, it&#39;s pretty terrible.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Wow... What&#39;s this? A group of strange creatures, and something else? They&#39;re not quite Shadow Servants...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...Either way, I believe Fujimaru will be able to do something about it\u2014</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> \u2014Now it&#39;s time for me to go back to bed.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;m sleepy because I was sending messages to Magi\u2606Mari till really late last night.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You kept sending her messages and she just kept yelling at you... Is that some sort of punishment?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It&#39;s not a punishment, it&#39;s a reward!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Though, I need to take a nap or something to reset my mind and regain my footing...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Foou!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Huh? It&#39;s you, Fou. You were left behind? Eh? You had a bad feeling so you didn&#39;t want to go?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Foou...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Rayshift complete, but... Where are we?</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong> It seems the Imperial Holy Grail lost control and created a separate dimension within this phase space.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Imperial... Holy Grail? What is that?</p><p><strong>Sakura Saber:</strong> We can talk later. They&#39;re coming!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The Grail\u2014is out of control?</p><p><strong>Sakura Saber:</strong> Yes. There was a Holy Grail War in our world, but the Grail was tampered with by some strange technology.</p><p><strong>Sakura Saber:</strong> At the end of all that tampering, its power got out of control...</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong> Unfortunately, I got involved in the accident and my subconscious materialized. It&#39;s starting to\u2014corrupt reality.</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong> Worst of all, it took away most of my power. Originally I should be OP like a Last Boss, but now I&#39;m like a 0.5 star Servant...</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong> In short, I got nerfed to a level 1 noob.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Star?</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong> With my power, I should&#39;ve been a 5-star character. Why did it end up like this...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> So you&#39;re one of those...</p><p><strong>Sakura Saber:</strong> I&#39;m sorry our Archer is causing you so much trouble.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So that indescribable creature is the manifestation of Demon Archer&#39;s subconscious and power?</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong> Y-Yeah. I don&#39;t quite understand it myself, but that seems to be the case.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> How irresponsible...</p><p><strong>Sakura Saber:</strong> This has nothing to do with you, I&#39;m sorry that you&#39;ve gotten involved.</p><p><strong>Sakura Saber:</strong> It&#39;s basically all Archer&#39;s fault, so please complain to her as much as you want.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It only has one eye...</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong> I-It&#39;s only being hidden by hair, yes? See, it&#39;s just like Mash over there!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Don&#39;t lump me in with that thing!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> By the way, I found this during the earlier battle. ...A bowl? Perhaps? And a steel pot?</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong> Looks like the magical energy leaking from the Grail copied what&#39;s \u201Cvaluable\u201D in my mind.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Valuable? A black pot and an old bowl... They don&#39;t look like they&#39;re that valuable...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Mash, can I have a look at them? Hmm, hmm...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> What is this? Such dusty looking vessels are valuable in the Far East?</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong> Rude Westerners! Rikyu will punch you for not understanding value in the simple and subdued!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Well, even if you claim this is valuable... Wait, now that you mention it...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> \u2014I&#39;m curious! These tea set-like things? My workshop will take them!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You&#39;re interested in them?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Just look at this black, unsightly teapot! Quality iron, smooth to the touch...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...But is super dull in shape and color. Still, I feel like it has an indescribable charm, or maybe not so much?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s what she meant by \u201Csimple and subdued!\u201D</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong> Oh, you are quite knowledgeable. I&#39;ll make you some tea later.</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong> Let&#39;s see, I&#39;ll rent out an entire temple somewhere...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Won&#39;t it explode?</p><p><strong>Sakura Saber:</strong> No, no, there is no way a teapot could ever explode.</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong> You think so?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I-In any case, let&#39;s head towards the center of this Singularity.</p><p><strong>Sakura Saber:</strong> We somewhat forced your hand for assistance, but I hope we can work together well.</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong> Right! Let&#39;s go, everyone! On to the journey that will unify this nation by force!</p><h2 id="act-1-sneak-attack-gudaguda-okehazama" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#act-1-sneak-attack-gudaguda-okehazama" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Act 1: Sneak Attack!!

In two seconds.</p><p><strong>Musashibou Sessai:</strong> Two seconds? Oh I&#39;m sorry, right away! Please don&#39;t put your hand on your blade.</p><p><strong>Musashibou Sessai:</strong> However, my lord, camping in a place like this is dangerous. Don&#39;t let your guard down.</p><p><strong>Imagawa Yoshitsune:</strong> I am fully aware of that. After all, I&#39;m a genius. I don&#39;t mind danger and stuff.</p><p><strong>Imagawa Yoshitsune:</strong> If we&#39;re attacked, we wake right up and attack back. Enemies can&#39;t easily approach an army this size to begin with.</p><p><strong>Mini-Nobu:</strong> Nobu nobuu!</p><p><strong>Imagawa Yoshitsune:</strong> See, this mysterious creature says so, too. Ben\u2013 I mean, Sessai, you worry too much.</p><p><strong>Musashibou Sessai:</strong> I see... I hope nothing serious ends up happening...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Looks like some Servants are bringing those strange creatures along with them...</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong> Hmm, it seems they brainwash Servants summoned by the Holy Grail, and then they put those Servants to work...</p><p><strong>Sakura Saber:</strong> Those do look like Heroic Spirits, but something&#39;s odd.Maybe some unnecessary factors got mixed in during their summons.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> In any case, it&#39;ll be difficult to fight an army that large. What should we do?</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong> Indeed, this calls for\u2014 a night raid, of course!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Night raid?</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong> That&#39;s right! It&#39;s the best way for a few to attack many! By the way, when I was young...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That&#39;s like Okehazama!</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong> You study hard, I&#39;m impressed! Yes, with that battle I revealed my intention to unify the nation!</p><p><strong>Sakura Saber:</strong> I&#39;ll catch the enemy&#39;s attention. Everyone, ambush the main army when you get the chance!</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong> Listen to me!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Sakura Saber, will you be okay going alone?</p><p><strong>Sakura Saber:</strong> Despite my looks, I&#39;m used to dealing with large groups, and those trivial enemies can&#39;t possibly defea...</p><p><strong>Sakura Saber:</strong> Kugh?! (coughs blood)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Whaaaaaat?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> A-Are you all right!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> MEDIC!</p><p><strong>Sakura Saber:</strong> D-Don&#39;t be alarmed... This is simply a skill of mine...</p><p><strong>Sakura Saber:</strong> Sometimes I&#39;m unable to act, or I&#39;m defenseless before an enemy. That&#39;s all this ability does...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What kind of useless skill is that?</p><p><strong>Sakura Saber:</strong> (Sob) After all, I&#39;m a useless soldier. Who made the Bakumatsu like that?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I see, that&#39;s pretty fatal!</p><p><strong>Sakura Saber:</strong> It&#39;s not as if I like having this skill! I can&#39;t remove it even if I wanted to!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Hmm? Who&#39;s making a fuss over there?</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong> Come on! See, now they found us because you were making so much noise!</p><p><strong>Matsudaira Arash:</strong> Are you the insolent bunch after Lord Yoshitsune? You have some nerve attacking an army this large.</p><p><strong>Matsudaira Arash:</strong> ...But I respect your courage! Therefore I, Matsudaira Arash, the vanguard of this troop,</p><p><strong>Matsudaira Arash:</strong> the best archer in these seas\u2014no, the best archer in the Orient! \u2014will rain punishment down on you!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I am so confused right now!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Matsudaira Arash:</strong> This isn&#39;t good... But it&#39;s not over yet...</p><p><strong>Matsudaira Arash:</strong> I will show you... This attack has all my body and soul poured into it!</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong> I&#39;ve got a bad feeling about this... Looks like there&#39;s a lot of power going into that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A-Anyway, let&#39;s run away!</p><p><strong>Sakura Saber:</strong> Everything&#39;s a mess right now, but we have no choice. Run!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Where can we run to?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> But that&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Matsudaira Arash:</strong> It&#39;s impossible to run from my bow. Its range is 2,500 kilometers!</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong> That&#39;s not a bow anymore!</p><p><strong>Imagawa Yoshitsune:</strong> The moon is nice tonight, Benkei... I mean, Sessai.</p><p><strong>Musashibou Sessai:</strong> You ended up saying my whole name, my lord. The moon is indeed lovely, but still...</p><p><strong>Imagawa Yoshitsune:</strong> Strange people seem to be approaching us... Do you know who they are?</p><p><strong>Musashibou Sessai:</strong> I wonder if they&#39;re the patrol that Matsudaira sent out.</p><p><strong>Demon Archer :</strong> Move, move! Get out of our way!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Sorry, we&#39;re going to pass through here!</p><p><strong>Imagawa Yoshitsune:</strong> ...They&#39;re gone now. I wonder what that was about?</p><p><strong>Imagawa Yoshitsune:</strong> So, Benkei... I mean Sessai. There&#39;s one more thing I wanted to ask.</p><p><strong>Imagawa Yoshitsune:</strong> Did we shoot off some fireworks during the feast?</p><p><strong>Musashibou Sessai:</strong> No, I didn&#39;t hear about that...</p><p><strong>Imagawa Yoshitsune:</strong> Then what&#39;s that light streaking across the sky like a shooting star...</p><p><strong>Musashibou Sessai:</strong> It&#39;s shining brightly, like a shooting star indeed.</p><p><strong>Matsudaira Arash:</strong> Stella\u2014!</p><p><strong>Imagawa Yoshitsune:</strong> Th-This can&#39;t be.

Where&#39;s Sakura Saber?</p><p><strong>Sakura Saber:</strong> Sorry, I&#39;m feeling sick today... Cough!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This is bad! Without Saber, fighting a Lancer class is going to be difficult!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Sakura Saber&#39;s really difficult to deal with...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;re talking kinda funny!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> You&#39;re right. What should I do? I know! Let&#39;s ask Magi\u2606Mari! (Escape from reality)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Even the Doctor&#39;s been contaminated...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Chaldea should have been quarantined... Da Vinci, please make a vaccine!</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong> You unreliable man-slayer... Huh? What? What&#39;s going on? He&#39;s running away.</p><p><strong>Shimazu S\xE9tanta:</strong> They have more people than our scout reported! I need to pull back for now.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I don&#39;t really get it, but this is our chance! Let&#39;s go after him, Senpai!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> All right! After him!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Mash Kyrielight, charging in!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, I&#39;ll carry Sakura Saber on my back.</p><p><strong>Sakura Saber:</strong> ...Thanks for always helping me, Mash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This is the first time!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;ve got a bad feeling about this...</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong> Oh, shut it. Follow me!</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong> Hurry up and recover, man-slayer, or you&#39;re going to get labeled a useless Servant!</p><p><strong>Sakura Saber:</strong> Strong Servant, weak Servant. That&#39;s up to them...</p><p><strong>Sakura Saber:</strong> A truly strong Master will... (Cough!)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Anyway, please get some rest!</p><p><strong>Shimazu S\xE9tanta:</strong> Oh, so they actually managed to catch up...</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong> Hahahaha! We&#39;ve got you now, Shimazu... or whatever your name is! Now prepare yourself!</p><p><strong>Shimazu S\xE9tanta:</strong> Yea, I think\u2014 You&#39;re the ones who need to prepare yourselves.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What? We&#39;re being hit! From where?</p><p><strong>Chousokabe Emichika:</strong> Looks like Lancer led you right into our trap. Time to show you the power of an Archer.</p><p><strong>Chousokabe Emichika:</strong> Trace on! Broken Phantasm: Shoot!</p><p><strong>Chousokabe Emichika:</strong> When am I going to use this bow? That&#39;d be right now! Fiiiiiish!</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong> What is this rain of arrows? Is it an ambush? Oh, so when you ambush someone you want to...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This is no time for explanations! We&#39;re not in some kind of seminar!</p><p><strong>Mouri Medinari:</strong> Ha, ha, ha. You dummies fell right into my plan. Good work, Lancer! I&#39;ll buy you some bread later.</p><p><strong>Shimazu S\xE9tanta:</strong> Are you treating me like a kid? Get something with yakisoba in it. Nothing spicy!</p><p><strong>Shimazu S\xE9tanta:</strong> ...You guys should be more cautious. Me running away should&#39;ve alerted you.</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong> How could I be so careless... There&#39;s been no greater shame since Kanegasaki, Nagamasa...</p><p><strong>Chousokabe Emichika:</strong> Looks like you&#39;ve given up. What are you planning on doing with them, Caster?</p><p><strong>Mouri Medinari:</strong> Let&#39;s see... What should we do with them?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m sorry, Senpai... If only Sakura Saber could fight with us...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Don&#39;t give up!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Do you have a plan that could get us out of this?</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong> Well if Monkey or Micchi were here, we could leave this to them and run away...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> How do you feel?</p><p><strong>Sakura Saber:</strong> ... (Dead silent)</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong> No response. She&#39;s on her last legs.</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong> Looks like we got a faulty Saber. Thanks for your service.</p><p><strong>Mouri Medinari:</strong> Hahahahaha! Before Mouri Medinari, you&#39;re like a moth drawn to a flame!</p><p><strong>Mouri Medinari:</strong> ...Am I playing the bad guy role a bit too heavy?</p><p><strong>Sakura Saber:</strong> ...Mouri?</p><p><strong>Shimazu S\xE9tanta:</strong> You were always the bad guy.</p><p><strong>Shimazu S\xE9tanta:</strong> In any case, I guess my role here as Shimazu or whatever is over.</p><p><strong>Sakura Saber:</strong> ...Shimazu?</p><p><strong>Chousokabe Emichika:</strong> I have no clue why I ended up as Chousokabe, but I guess that&#39;s the way it goes.</p><p><strong>Sakura Saber:</strong> ...Chousokabe... Tosa?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...What? Sakura Saber is...</p><p><strong>Sakura Saber:</strong> Uuuoohhhh!</p><p><strong>Sakura Saber:</strong> ...With sadness and misplaced anger giving me power, I shall now don the haori of my oath!</p><p><strong>Sakura Saber:</strong> Satsuma and Choshu shall die! No mercy!</p><p><strong>Mouri Medinari:</strong> Huh? Satsuma and Choshu? What&#39;s that? This girl is completely different now! I&#39;m scared!</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong> I shall explain!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Eek! That caught me off guard!</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong> This feeble man-slayer, known as Sakura Saber... Her True Name echoed through the streets of Kyoto at the end of the shogunate.</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong> The one who swore to kill all Satsuma and Choshu... The captain of the Shinsengumi&#39;s First Unit, Okita Souji!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> All of a sudden you reveal her True Name?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> So you mean Okita Souji is a girl? Though, I guess I&#39;m used to that by now!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m not really knowledgeable about that era, but is she a famous Heroic Spirit, Senpai?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Pretty famous in Japan.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Wow, a girl, no way. (lifeless)</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong> By the way, my True Name is Oda No\u2013</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong> It&#39;s finally time to pay Satsuma and Choshu back for Toba-Fushimi, Mr. Kondou!</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong> Yes! Also, I can&#39;t really forgive Tosa, either!</p><p><strong>Chousokabe Emichika:</strong> There&#39;s the Satcho Alliance too, so that can&#39;t be helped. But, I am the one that&#39;s troubled for being called Chousokabe.</p><p><strong>Okita Souji:</strong> Shinsengumi&#39;s First Unit Captain, Okita Souji! Here I come!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mouri Medinari:</strong> Ah... The old me is so pitiful it hurts...</p><p><strong>Shimazu S\xE9tanta:</strong> Oh my mentor, I&#39;m sorry... By the way, that bodysuit...</p><p><strong>Chousokabe Emichika:</strong> Indeed, this is a bit stranger than expected...</p><p><strong>Okita Souji:</strong> Haaah, haaah... I-I did it, Mr. Hijikata... (Passes out)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> When Sakura Saber... I mean, when Okita donned her haori, she was ferocious, huh, Senpai?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> As expected of the genius swordsman.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> If she was in the First Squad, does that mean there were other powerful swordsmen in the Shinsengumi?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> She collapsed again...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Hang in there, Okita! Have this Golden Fruit!</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong> By the way, you&#39;re not interested in my True Name? I&#39;m super famous in the Far East.</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong> It&#39;s hard, you know, being such a popular Heroic Spirit! Everybody wants a piece of me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, it&#39;s time for lunch, Senpai. I packed us some.</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong> Guess nobody cares, huh?</p><h2 id="act-4-overwhelming-victory-gudaguda-tenka-fubu" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#act-4-overwhelming-victory-gudaguda-tenka-fubu" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Act 4: Overwhelming Victory!!

She&#39;s annoying. Especially when she warps around.</p><p><strong>Okita Souji:</strong> Look who&#39;s talking!</p><p><strong>Okita Souji:</strong> If you hadn&#39;t tried to convert the Grail into a bomb, this never would&#39;ve happened!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You turned the Grail\u2014into a bomb!?</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong> Yes, I planned to use it as a superweapon to turn things around.</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong> But I screwed up and fell headfirst into the reactor core as it was reconstructing...</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong> Because of that, my powers were taken and weird creatures were born. It&#39;s unbelievable.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I don&#39;t understand, but now I know that you were up to some crazy things...</p><p><strong>Okita Souji:</strong> Oh, we made it here while she was blabbing.

Welcome, mongrels!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Th-This voice!</p><p><strong>Toyotomi Gilyoshi:</strong> It is I, Toyotomi Gilyoshi! King of Heroes and ruler of Zipangu, the Land of Gold!</p><p><strong>Toyotomi Gilyoshi:</strong> All the treasures of this world, be they gold, or really nice tea sets, are all mine, hah!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Man, this situation is really getting out of hand. \u201CHah?\u201D</p><p><strong>Demon Archer:</strong> Hmm... He kind of reminds me of Monkey.</p><p><strong>Toyotomi Gilyoshi:</strong> Don&#39;t be mistaken, mongrels. This amount of mud won&#39;t even shake my being! I&#39;m here on a different matter!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A different matter?</p><p><strong>Toyotomi Gilyoshi:</strong> I won&#39;t allow you to forget! I&#39;m speaking of the time I bestowed treasures upon you! I offered you the finest gifts...</p><p><strong>Toyotomi Gilyoshi:</strong> ...yet you mongrels greedily said how Rome&#39;s was better, or how you wanted the Dark ones!</p><p><strong>Toyotomi Gilyoshi:</strong> I wanted those too! I... I suffered too... I suffered greatly.</p><p><strong>Toyotomi Gilyoshi:</strong> Why... Why didn&#39;t anyone... come to my 10 Summons...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> He said it wasn&#39;t going to shake his being, but things have become disappointing for the King of Heroes.</p><p><strong>Toyotomi Gilyoshi:</strong> I won&#39;t give up.
