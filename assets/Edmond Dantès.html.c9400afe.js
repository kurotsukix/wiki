Dark. Lightless. There was only a sinking sensation, like I&#39;d fallen into somewhere very, very deep.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Or is there nothing there to see? I don&#39;t know. I can&#39;t even tell whether my eyes are open.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Where am I? I don&#39;t know. Am I standing or sitting?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I try to speak. My lips don&#39;t move. My tongue doesn&#39;t move. No sound comes from my throat.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Ah. Am I in a bad situation?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> My body does feel heavy...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Looks like you have fallen deep.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> But yes. It&#39;s probably why it was you of all people.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Welcome, Fujimaru. Welcome to the deep place where all sorts of carcasses fall, sink, and remain.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...Hmph. What&#39;s with that look? Those lost puppy eyes are a waste of time with me.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Of course, time is meaningless. At least in a place like this.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Are you by chance...?</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong> Do you know me? No. It can&#39;t be. You know nothing.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Don&#39;t you get it, Master? Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I have come from a place far beyond love and hatred. And so, I am somewhat...different from the version of me you know.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...All right. They&#39;ll be here soon.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> You must leave this place. I am the one who shall burn away the remnants of darkness festering here.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> My flames shall scorch your self and soul, and I cannot guarantee your safety.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Forgive me. You do not belong in a place like this.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I don&#39;t want to.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on, but I can&#39;t leave you alone.</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong> ...I see. Then keep up, and mind the flames.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> ...What are you doing here, Berserker?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> I&#39;ll ask you the same question: what are you doing in Master&#39;s room? It is the middle of the night.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Sleep is necessary to maintain the health of a human body. I advise you to return to your own room to rest, Mister Edmond Dant\xE8s.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> I am a Servant. You are as well.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> I&#39;m speaking of Master. Our conversation will interrupt [\u2642 his /\u2640\uFE0F her} sleep cycle. Though [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she} may be sleeping peacefully right now...</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Peacefully, is that right?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> ...Something the matter, sir?</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> No. As long as [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she} is sleeping, that&#39;s fine.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> I was worried some residual effect might remain in [\u2642 his /\u2640\uFE0F her} consciousness... No, it&#39;s nothing. Forget about it.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Mister Dant\xE8s. May I ask a question?</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> If you must.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> It&#39;s been bothering me for a while, but it seems an emergency operation will be necessary.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> I must take action before it is too late. Leave it to me. I shall pursue the most effective treatment for the injured area.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> ...Master is not injured. As you pointed out, I hear peaceful breathing.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> No. Wrong, Sir.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> I am talking about you. Your mental state is injured. If it&#39;s the surgical removal of the affected area you require, leave it to me.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> ...What?</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Merc\xE9d\xE8s. I know of your wicked ways, but to go that far seems excessive, even to you?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Just like that. That statement. You may not realize it, but your outbursts suggest that you&#39;re mistaking me for someone else.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Swift, decisive action must be taken. Yes. You have uttered troubling nonsense about the sleeping Master.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> ...Wait.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> No. Measures will be taken.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Don&#39;t you dare come at me with a scalpel in one hand and a gun in the other. At least hold the scalpel in your dominant hand. No, that&#39;s not what I meant to say!</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Why are you watching Master sleep, anyway? You must have sensed some sort of abnormality.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s instinct, or if you sensed something in [\u2642 his /\u2640\uFE0F her} magical energy, but you are correct. You&#39;ve read the situation right.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Master is in contact with many Servants, so how did this happen to [\u2642 his /\u2640\uFE0F her} mental state?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Stop talking nonsense.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> ...Merc\xE9d\xE8s.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Like I said, my name is not Merc\xE9d\xE8s. You are suffering from an affliction of the mind.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> It appears that you do not see me as a Servant. You call me Berserker, yet still call me Merc\xE9d\xE8s.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> I am not her. I am not the woman whom you call by that name.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Of course not. Your Spirit Origin doesn&#39;t have the memories of those seven days.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Yet...whenever I hear that name, strangely...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> It makes me long for something far away... Something that I no longer possess.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> However, as I am still not this Merc\xE9d\xE8s, there is nothing for it but to take the appropriate measures. Thus...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> ...I shall disinfect that mental state of yours.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Oh. He has fled.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> ...Unbelievable. Next time I see him, I must be sure to tend to him.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...A dream where Nightingale was arguing with someone?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Something like that...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I don&#39;t remember it all that clearly...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What a strange dream. I am no expert in interpreting dreams...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But if you would like, shall I try accessing Chaldea&#39;s database?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Even I can do that much. It&#39;s not like we&#39;re booting up Sheba or Trismegistus.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> Oh? Are you trying to perform oneiromancy? Leave it to me!</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> Since ancient times, as far back as the Age of Gods, humanity has tried to interpret the meaning of their dreams.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> The most famous of dream interpreter of your modern time would be Sigmund Freud...</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> But my dream interpretation is one of a kind! Hee hee. I call it\u2013</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> Thrilling DC dream interpretation!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> Exciting AC dream interpretation!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> Huh...!? If you shoot AC through your brain, it&#39;ll be a \u201CScanners\u201D kind of head explosion catastrophe!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> Haha, you know nothing, furball! AC is harmless to the body! It&#39;s even healthy if used in the right amount!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> It can do anything! For example, it can observe how neurons communicate in detail!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> Let us decipher what is inside Fujimaru&#39;s head once and for all!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> For example, what is Master&#39;s favorite dish? And of course, what is [\u2642 his /\u2640\uFE0F her} favorite AC!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> Argh! You mean things like what kind of clothes Master likes! And of course, what is [\u2642 his /\u2640\uFE0F her} favorite DC!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> ...What kind of DC...? You misspoke, Edison. You&#39;re making no sense.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong></p><p>Look who&#39;s talking!!!!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Th-they&#39;re fighting again... Those two are really going at it. It&#39;s such a childish fight! And they&#39;ve already come to blows!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But to be honest, observing the brain is a bit much...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Sounds interesting.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> S-Senpai! I know it sounds interesting...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But those two may really lay bare everything in your mind. If that happens...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I have a feeling it would do more harm than good...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Things like your favorite food wouldn&#39;t be an issue... But certain other types of information that might be revealed...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...They would definitely cause problems!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> No, I&#39;m not down for invasion of my privacy.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s right! It&#39;s no good! It&#39;s not right to look into other people&#39;s heads!</p><hr><p><strong>Helena:</strong> Well said, Mash. You&#39;re quite right.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> Things like this must be done in secret. It was my fault for bringing it up in a public place like this.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> Let&#39;s put both Lemurian oneiromancy and the dream reading I learned directly from the Mahatmas on hold for today. Yep.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> I&#39;m sorry. And... You two bratty geniuses!</p><p><strong>Gentleman &amp; Lion:</strong></p><p>Y-yes, ma&#39;am!</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> Don&#39;t start fighting as soon as you see each other! If you have that much energy to spare, go to the simulator!</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> Twenty consecutive Soul Eaters and Spriggans! Work out your extra energy that way!</p><p><strong>Gentleman &amp; Lion:</strong> Wh-whaaaaat!?</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> What did you say!? Be polite!</p><p><strong>Gentleman &amp; Lion:</strong></p><p>Yes, ma&#39;am!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I can&#39;t believe what I just saw. That...they really went through twenty consecutive battles!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Those two looked really determined. It was quite an inspiring sight to see.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Electric Lion&#39;s Proud Infinite Battle.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Electric Gentleman&#39;s Brave Infinite Battle.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Infinite... It really was intense.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai, did you just stumble a bit?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Oh, did I?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I might&#39;ve gotten dizzy watching the infinite battle.</p><hr><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Oh, Master. Mash. What a wonderful morning.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Good morning, Amakusa. Oh! And Jeanne d&#39;Arc Alter Santa Lily.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong> Good morning! Um, if my name&#39;s too hard to say, you can call me Lily, or Alter. Even Jeanne!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Well, then I will call you Jeanne Alter. Good morning once again.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong> Yes... Good morning!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong> Mentor, is something wrong?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> The smiles on your faces were simply dazzling. As warm as the sun itself rising into the sky.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> It is truly wonderful, and fills my heart.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong> Y-you think so? Um, did I just get praised?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Yes. Of course.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> ...By the way, Master. Has anything new happened?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Nothing really...</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Is that so? Well, then, never mind.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> As I&#39;d expect of the avenging demon who advanced his own mentality to that state. I&#39;m relieved to see that he is doing his job properly.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I think I had a dream about Nightingale.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> ...A dream about someone arguing with Nightingale? I see, so that&#39;s what&#39;s going on.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> She, too, is perceptive, in a way... No. Never mind. Apologies, I have said too much.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Amakusa?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> No, nothing. I was only talking to myself.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong> ...?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong> Mentor, what are you talking about? I am so confused.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> This is rather a complicated matter. Well, if I had to cut it down to a single phrase...</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> ...It&#39;s just a dream. The sort that someone like you, who&#39;s been through so much this past year, would have.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...You&#39;ve sunk down here again.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Unbelievable. You really are a curious Master.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> You could have had a peaceful dream, or lain in a dreamless slumber.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> But instead you come here, to this awful place. I suggest you stop.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Do you understand? This place is too dangerous.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> This darkness is indeed a part of your dream, but one normally would not see this. It is not a place where you should linger.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> The me here is quite different than the me you know. I may not always be so hospitable.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Begone. And forget this place.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You don&#39;t look any different to me.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...Ha. You make me laugh! You don&#39;t change a bit, no matter where you are, Master!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> No different, huh?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Right. That&#39;s correct. I may be different from me, but we are in many ways the same person.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I am the Avenger who existed during those seven days, and I am also the Servant who fights along with you.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Both of them are essentially me.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> But, to be precise... The me here, in this place, is slightly different.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I show my true ability in these darkest depths. I am one who looks into your soul, that shines brightly like the flames of hell.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You&#39;re not going to smoke?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...Ah, yes.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I am afraid I lack a light. Or, have I handed you one before?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Then, please. My dark flame of vengeance would simply char my precious cigar.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> (Puff) ...You&#39;re impertinent. Even in the black depths of a dream, you try to amuse me.</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong> ...Tonight is the night to finish this.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> This is the cacophony of noise that has accumulated inside of you in consequence of your connection with so many heroic Spirits.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> They are remnants of dreams, shadows, and illusions. Dark things piled up deep within your soul. In a way, this is your... trash heap.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> The regrets, resentments, and shattered wishes of the myriad enemies you&#39;ve defeated. Yes, that&#39;s right... everything from love to hatred.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> There is only one thing I can say to you now: begone.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> This is my job. It is not something you should see.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Through your dreams, you have connected with the memories of many Heroic Spirits, and accomplished much, have you not? That is enough.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> There&#39;s no need for you to take responsibility for even the leftover emotions of corpses.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong> ...But, just in case. Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> If you wish from the bottom of your heart...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I don&#39;t want you to fight alone!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I can&#39;t leave you alone!</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong> Ha...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Hahahahahahahahahaha! Fine! Then do not fall behind!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Mere droplets, discarded and decayed! Ones that could not even reach anger, but merely sunk and festered.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I shall consume them with my flames!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> My prey is the very carcasses of the phantoms you fought within the memories of the Heroic Spirits that your soul watches over!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Hahaha. Yes, let their form be made clear this time!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> And mine as well!</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> ...Come, let us eradicate those that wander!</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Let&#39;s go, Master. We&#39;re going to take that thing beyond love and hatred!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> ...We meet again, sir.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Indeed.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Master&#39;s room is up ahead. Do you have business there? It is already late, and interrupting one&#39;s slumber is bad for their health.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> No. I... Well... I suppose I&#39;m just enjoying a midnight stroll.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> What about you, Berserker? The Mage King&#39;s threat is no more. Why are you so on edge?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> I am not on edge. I am simply looking for a chance to disinfect your brain.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Your mental state is injured. Your mental state is polluted, abnormal.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> ...It&#39;s twisted. Injured. Wounded.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> ...Heh heh heh.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> You are...laughing?</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Of course I&#39;m laughing! My mental state is far, far removed from any normal person&#39;s!</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> I am the vengeful demon! I am one who ceased to be human ages ago! I am the Count of Monte Cristo!</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> ...But I have no need of treatment from you. I am what I am, and I have incarnated as myself in this 21st century.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> As long as Master desires it, the Count of Monte Cristo shall exist. As long as [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she} continues to fight, I shall lend my assistance.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> To put it in your terms, the \u201Cinjury\u201D to my mental state is one that cannot be cured.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> It is precisely the fact that my mind is beyond love and hatred, beyond madness, that certain things become possible for me... It may not happen often, but it does happen.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> You are not making sense. Please speak clearly and concisely.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Treatment is unnecessary. Just leave me be, Merc\xE9d\xE8s.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> And do not come near me. Your straightforward ways are similar to Fujimaru&#39;s.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> And it is quite blinding...to me.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> ...?</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Go check on Master in the morning. [\u2642 His /\u2640\uFE0F Her} mind and body may be somewhat exhausted.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> ...After all, [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she} will have had a nightmare.</p>',240),a=[r];function i(g,h){return e(),o("div",null,a)}var l=t(s,[["render",i],["__file","Edmond Dant\xE8s.html.vue"]]);export{l as default};
