It comes from how the German mercenary (Hessian) that becomes the rider had been reduced into a monster reaching Dullahan.

Exceedingly fastidious, Lobo in particular is unable to simply open up his heart. Such a way being is less of that of an antihero and more of that of an avenger. Nevertheless, there is no other way but to keep on connecting with them in patience and perseverance.

The Hessian is famous in Sleepy Hollow\u2026 so much so that I had to really think what to make of him, but then I had him with a military uniform that does not really look out of place and a gigantic sword scythe in hand.
