There&#39;s something that I left on that Island.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> If it&#39;s no problem, I&#39;d like to leave now\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We&#39;re lucky we have a ship, but what did you leave behind?</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Oh, a statue of Artemis\u2013the Lunar goddess.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> I made it by hand, but I couldn&#39;t take it with me during the battle.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I see.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> We were born from the gods, and they give us power. We must never fail to be grateful.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> ...Well, despite their great power, some of them can be a little strange.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> It&#39;s their charm point, and their weakness.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Yeah, you&#39;ve had a rough time because of it\u2013</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> There should be a cave on the other side of this forest. Let&#39;s go.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> ...The stench of animals. Mash, ready your weapon\u2013 and prepare for combat.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Right!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This is\u2013a chimera!</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> A demonic beast left behind in this world... Its luck ran out when it met a hunter, though.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> I will make good use of its meat and pelt.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> What a headache... Let&#39;s keep going.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Are we almost at the cave?</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Yeah...Okay, this is the entrance. Let&#39;s go.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> ...Hey, Master, do you have any wishes for the Grail?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Not really.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Hmm. I see...</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Well, given the state of the world that makes sense, I guess.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> But the Grail&#39;s power is omnipotent. Perhaps you should come up with a wish.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> To restore the world.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> ...Hmph. That&#39;s exactly the right wish. But it&#39;s also the wrong answer.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> When you get the Grail, that wish should come true on its own.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> A greedy answer isn&#39;t necessarily the wrong one. Keep that in mind.</p><hr><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> ...To tell the truth, I have a wish of my own. It&#39;s a simple wish, and I know it will never come true\u2013</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> But I still can&#39;t give up on it. That&#39;s why I pray to the gods.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> I protect my vows to the gods. ...Or so I thought...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Atalante is looking off into the distance...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Yeah, that goddess was pretty... impactful.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> ...Enough talking, I suppose. It&#39;s time for combat.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Master, stay back. ...Let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> We should be almost there... Oh, good. This is it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s the statue of the goddess?</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Yes, it&#39;s handmade. Impressive, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> If you just add Orion there.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Needs more Orion.</p><hr><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Y-You want me to make one of him? Hmm... He&#39;s the type of person I hate most.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> He&#39;s lazy, lustful, and never learns. He&#39;s only interested in having fun, and doesn&#39;t care for others.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> ...He did look like he was having fun, but that fun is far too different for my tastes.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Not my type of man at all. If I had to pick between him and Jason, I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d do.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I-It&#39;s that bad?</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Let me ask you, Mash. If Jason and Orion were the last two men in the world, who would you marry?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh? I&#39;d um... Well...</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> See what I mean...huh?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Hehehe, that&#39;s not a nice way to talk about someone&#39;s boyfriend, is it...Atalante?</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> ...Hyah!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> T-That voice!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Hey guys!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Hello, I know this is a surprise but I am back... Speaking of which, Mash are you busy later?</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Hehehehe. Even if it&#39;s the truth, denying it is proof of my love!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> So let&#39;s do this! If I win you&#39;ll never get my blessing again.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> I don&#39;t know about my Brother, though!</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> That&#39;s crazy!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Ugh, I lost. I guess my love still isn&#39;t strong enough!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Huh? You&#39;ve got more love? Seriously? What you&#39;ve got is already crushing me...</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Well, if I lost, I lost. You may retain my blessing!</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Thank you Goddess, I will continue to treasure this statue.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Okay Orion, let&#39;s go back!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Mash, at least hold me tight against your chest... BRWRAH!</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Well. That was an unexpected interruption, but we made it through...</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Thank you, Master. I owe you.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Now let us return. Want to take that chimera meat with us?</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> You must be sick of rations. No? I see...</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Then this boar pelt... No, huh? Hmph. This is difficult.</p><h2 id="london-child" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#london-child" aria-hidden="true">#</a> London Child</h2><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> I&#39;m sorry, Master. May I have a word?</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> ... ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What is it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You look depressed.</p><hr><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> ...I want to go to this London place you visited. Will you help?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> \u2013We&#39;re here, but why are we here?</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> I heard there was a child Servant.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Jack the Ripper. Yes, she WAS a child... I think.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> To think that&#39;s who she really was... What a shock.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> That&#39;s not exactly right. She&#39;s simply one aspect of Jack the Ripper.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Jack the Ripper is a black box, filled with the beliefs, hypotheses, and ideas of people everywhere.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Even without knowing the real killer, as long as you know the name you can summon the appropriate Servant.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> ...In that sense, she&#39;s similar to Hassan-i Sabbah.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> In a normal Holy Grail War, one of almost 20 of them can be summoned via the concept of \u201CAssassin\u201D</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You sure know a lot. I am surprised.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> I&#39;ve crossed paths with them. I hope that child disappears completely...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh? She should&#39;ve disappeared already\u2013</p><p><strong>???:</strong> \u2013Hehehehe.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> !?!?!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It&#39;s weak, but I&#39;m picking up a reading around you! Be careful!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What...was that?</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Remnants of a Servant. Best to destroy them.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Hehe, hehehe, heheheheh.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> There&#39;s more!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This feeling... It&#39;s her! Fall back, Master!</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> \u2013Rest in peace, Jack!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...The reading in this area is gone. Doctor, are you picking up more?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Hold on, I&#39;m expanding the search radius. ...Ah! Yes, I&#39;ve found something similar...</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Let&#39;s head there, then. Master, Mash, follow me!</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> For a Servant, past Holy Grail Wars are more like hazy dreams than distant memories.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> No matter how strong a past bond might be, it will inevitably fade.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> ...Of course it will. Fighting a hundred Holy Grail Wars is like leading a hundred lives.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> More than anything, it ceases to feel real. You stop being able to cling to just one life.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> It doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re choosing a noble death. We&#39;re simply abandoning a pallid life.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> So we forget them\u2013like they were the dreams we once had. But some things cannot be forgotten.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> That battle, to me, was one of them.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Hehehe! Hehehe! Mommy! Mommy!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> \u2013Mommy!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This voice!</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> I thought you might not have completely disappeared... Jack the Ripper.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Yup. I mean, this world is wavering.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> So even we, who should no longer be here, can look for her once more.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> ...Stop it, Jack. You won&#39;t find your mother in this world.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Even if she did exist, she wouldn&#39;t accept you as her daughter.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Shut up! You don&#39;t know anything about us!</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> You&#39;re wrong. I do know you... However...</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> I don&#39;t understand you. I can&#39;t understand you. You don&#39;t want to be understood.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> You will try to fulfill your wish. I will stop you. That is all.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Okay, got it. Then\u2013 it&#39;s time to die!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Here it comes!</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Sorry, but I must finish you off. I truly am sorry.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Wah...wah... That&#39;s so mean...so mean...</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> \u2013You&#39;re right. I&#39;m mean. Still, I wanted to save you.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> I really, really wanted to save you. No matter how broken you were.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> ...I see. Hehe, you&#39;re weird, Mommy.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> We were...saved...already\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Whew... We beat her.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> ...No, we didn&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> As long as London exists, she&#39;ll keep coming back.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Until we restore history to its proper form.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh? But she\u2013</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Jack is special. When history is restored, she&#39;ll pass on as she should.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> ...That&#39;s what I want to believe.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Master, my wish is to save all the abused, unhappy children in this world.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> What do you think?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s a good wish.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That&#39;s a hard wish.</p><hr><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Thank you for not laughing.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> It may be hard. No, it may be close to impossible.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> But still... I can&#39;t give up on my wish.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Even if it becomes an eternal chain which binds me forever\u2013</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> I will keep fighting. Let&#39;s go, Master.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> First, we have to save the world so that the children can live.</p>',163),r=[a];function g(p,h){return e(),o("div",null,r)}var l=t(n,[["render",g],["__file","Atalante.html.vue"]]);export{l as default};
