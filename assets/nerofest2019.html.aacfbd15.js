Testing, testing. Okay, everything&#39;s fine. All right, here we go.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> A festival is...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> A party that brings joy to all people, no matter where or when they are from.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> It is no exaggeration to call this festival I host famed throughout both Rome and Chaldea!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> She started her speech already!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Hear, hear!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Umu. Thanks for your cheers. My audience truly knows how to behave the third time around!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> And that makes introductions unnecessary. Let&#39;s get down to business!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> I will leave nitpicking about the definition of a festival to the more cultured Servants.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> My glorious Nero Fest, a festival only possible through the cooperation of Rome and Chaldea!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Now it begins again!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Surely many Heroic Spirits look forward to this martial tournament set in this great Colosseum.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> A festival of power, modeled after the festival of Olympia! Attendees will praise the warriors&#39; courage!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Honed physiques and unparalleled skills in fierce competition! What could be more beautiful, more noble!?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> As people love to admire a blooming rose, so too do they enjoy seeing a human being reach their very limit!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> And that is itself my Rome...the festival of Olympia!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1ACrowd:</strong> Rome! Rome! Rome!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Rome!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Umu! All of humanity is indeed Rome!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> All hail the Emperor!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Hehehe. Your applause is making me blush.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> But, as emperor, I shall permit it! Enjoy this glorious festival!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Hola, \xBFc\xF3mo est\xE1s? I heard that there&#39;s going to be Lucha Libre at the Arena M\xE9xico, yes!?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Hehehe, I cannot wait, no! This will be the perfect time to test out my new plancha!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Master, my cute [\u2642 hermanito /\u2640 hermanita]. Why not participate as a [\u2642 luchadore /\u2640 luchadora]?</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> Haha. Not a bad idea! Training Master once in a while wouldn&#39;t hurt!</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> ...Hey, I&#39;m only kidding. Don&#39;t look at me like that, Master.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> Only those who truly WANT to slug it out should participate. Like me or this tall lady here.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Hnnn, no, no. You make it sound so barbaric, yes. Lucha is a clash of honed out skills.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> Ah, you got me there. Well, you know, there&#39;s all kindsa ways to say the same thing.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> There are some punches used in Lucha Libre, right? They call it, uh, \u201Cgolpe,\u201D or \u201Cpatada,\u201D or something?</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> Besides, this is all between Servants! Even if I really cut loose, nothing bad would happen!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> ...Ay yi yi.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> You have yet to understand the true essence of Lucha. I shall demonstrate it for you myself, yes!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> It&#39;s finally time for the long-awaited Servant Lucha Libre tournament. The sacred site for Lucha, the Arena M\xE9xico, has been rented out.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> This is the perfect chance to spread the wonderful word of Lucha to everyone!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Lucha, eh? From what I hear, the flow of the match is predetermined, and the proper protocol is to take whatever move comes head on.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Truly it would take a steely spirit that relies on sheer trust of your opponent. Uh, but you know, Quetzalcoatl...</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> If you have the battle go by your own bare-knuckle rules, none of the Good-aligned Heroic Spirits would be a match against you.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Besides, this isn&#39;t a Lucha tournament, and this isn&#39;t the Arena M\xE9xico.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> And...the Colosseum is not in Mexico City.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Qu\xE9!?!?!?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Lalalala! Not listening! Fergus, you meanie, yes!</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> You bastard! I was just going along with what the goddess was saying, then you sweep in to ruin it all! You&#39;re spoiling all the fun!</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> We&#39;re gonna end up slugging it out with our bare hands anyway, so might as well call it Lucha, jackass!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> You say that... And I suppose it is only right for a warrior to answer the call of Lucha.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Lamentably, I am no more than an amateur when it comes to Lucha. The only finishing hold I know is Tirabuz\xF3n.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> Tirabuz\xF3n, the Cobra Twist!? Old man, you&#39;re totally a Lucha enthusiast!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Hahaha!!! Miss Quetzal has challenged me a few times already!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Many times, in truth!</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> Oh come now, tell the truth. When you say she&#39;s challenged you, what you really mean is that you practiced Lucha in the simulator.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Ah yes. In the simulator room with nobody around at night...a Lucha Libre in the dark!</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> Shut up!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Three matches in just one hour!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Ah-ha! I knew it, yes! I hear true Lucha matches do happen mostly at night, yes!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> So during the day...the Roman Pankration! And at night...a carnival of Lucha where the air is filled with bulging muscles flying about!</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> Uh, that&#39;s not what I meant... Damn, you&#39;re just making things even worse, old man!</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> Uuuurrrr...</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> Try...best... (Makes fist)</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong> Wonderful, my dear! What intensity you have. Your passion and heat are like a steam engine on the verge of critical pressure.</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong> And so I have no choice but to aid you in your efforts. That&#39;s right...consider it a continuation of the dream we both shared this summer.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Hmmm, it would seem you&#39;ve beaten me to the punch. I do, however, share your sentiments, Babbage.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> My lovely daughter is so very excited. As her papa, I could do no less than to aid her in her quest for victory with all my strength!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Yes...that is the duty of a proper papa!</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> (Stare)</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> Nnnngh... Nnnnnggghhh...</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> ...Yes, of course, my lovely daughter.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I shall, using every conceivable means, with every imaginable trap, employing every possible act of villainy, dispose of all your competition!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I had meant to relax awhile, but perhaps this is a good time to truly apply myself.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> Uuuuuurrr!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Ah, yes, quite right. No cheating, of course! As such, papa will fire his magical bullets from the front line!</p><p><strong>Babbage:</strong> Steam power at full throttle, steam power at full throttle. We shall aid the daughter of Victor on her path to glorious and dazzling victory!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> ...C&#39;mon. You call yourself an Assassin? Shouldn&#39;t you be good at spying and scouting?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Why is finding some missing people taking so long!? You should be able to pick out which ones are NPCs and which ones are Servants!</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> S-sorry. I...actually don&#39;t have skills for that sort of thing...</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> The best I can do is to conceal myself within a crowd.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> You lack PRESENCE! Just hurry up and find Fran, you shut-in.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> I&#39;ve got this sinking feeling\u2013err, well actually, I have a feeling something exciting&#39;s about to happen.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Yes, yes. Strange. She was with me just a minute ago.</p><p><strong>Berserker of El Dorado:</strong> ...There&#39;s some kind of commotion.</p><p><strong>Berserker of El Dorado:</strong> I heard something regarding a festival of combat prowess, but that it was intended solely for amusement. I see no point in participating in such a thing.</p><p><strong>Berserker of El Dorado:</strong> What point or purpose is there in such restraint? What I yearn for is true and earnest combat.</p><p><strong>Berserker of El Dorado:</strong> That is all. There was no purpose in summoning me here, Caligula.</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong> I do not...wish...for bloodshed...</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong> Nor...do I desire...battle...</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong> Only...Nero...my love and hope...for her sake...I shall...</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong> GATHER MEDALS!!!</p><p><strong>Berserker of El Dorado:</strong> M-medals!? What!?</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong> Ooohhhhhhhhh!!!</p><p><strong>Berserker of El Dorado:</strong> Wh-what is the meaning of this!? Calm yourself, Emperor Caligula!</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong> MEDALS...WANT!!!</p><p><strong>Berserker of El Dorado:</strong> ...!!!</p><p><strong>Berserker of El Dorado:</strong> ...I see. So that is it.</p><p><strong>Berserker of El Dorado:</strong> While I remain uninterested in trivial diversions, the fact remains that I manifested in Chaldea as a Berserker, like you.</p><p><strong>Berserker of El Dorado:</strong> I also harbor a flame that I cannot seem to extinguish. Yes...it burns within me...</p><p><strong>Berserker of El Dorado:</strong> Fine, Caligula. Then I shall aid you temporarily!</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong> Oooooooooooohhhhhh!!!</p><p><strong>Berserker of El Dorado:</strong> Your fearsome temperament has impressed me. You may yet keep up with my strength!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Hmmmm. Two Berserkers interacting with each other... Makin&#39; me kinda jelly.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> A tournament with the silver-haired sporty-spice Berserker! The ferocious lion within me...okay, well, maybe it&#39;s not a lion...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Maybe a killer whale or a shark. Well, let&#39;s just say a carnivore is about to awaken!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> That physique, glistening with sweat from battle! And that iron ball that looks like a sea urchin! Hrnnngh! I&#39;d definitely be a goner if that hits me!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> ...So. You&#39;re okay with what happened?</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> Well, there&#39;s no point in this old man intervening.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> She said she wasn&#39;t interested in \u201Ctrivial diversions.\u201D And yet she&#39;s getting all fired up for this event. Things are just getting more complicated, is all.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> It&#39;s not as if we are strangers, and I would recommend that she calm down. But then again...</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> She&#39;s really not the type to listen to anyone past a certain point. I just pray no one does anything stupid.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> I see. Does that mean you&#39;ll be with me to...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> ...Watch the tournament. Carefully record it. Admire the beauties who move so beautifully around the tournament stage...</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> The only thing we agree on is that we both hope to get through this event without having to fight, Captain. Of course, if a storm is brewing, it won&#39;t matter whether we&#39;re audience members or not.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> I like playing outside, but hitting each other isn&#39;t a good game for girls.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> Playing tag or hide-and-go-seek would have been better. Oh, this event is more for boys.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> You think so? We like dismembering!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> But if you don&#39;t like it, Nursery, then we don&#39;t either. It&#39;s not fun if we can&#39;t play together.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> Teehee. Thank you. Do you agree too, Ibaraki-Douji?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> Um...unnngh. W-well, normally I reeeally try to enjoy smashing, tearing, and pillaging as an oni should...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> But I&#39;m with Jack on this one. If Nursery Rhyme doesn&#39;t like it, then I won&#39;t force it on you.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> So what should we play? House is fun, so is ball...but I want some excitement...</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> I know. Let&#39;s ask the other kid!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Other kid?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> Hm? Who&#39;s that?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> Could it be!?</p><p><strong>Assassin of the Nightless City:</strong> ...Kuhaha. I didn&#39;t expect you to see through my Presence Concealment! You guys are good!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> I don&#39;t think you tried too hard to hide. I kept seeing your pretty dress flapping.</p><p><strong>Assassin of the Nightless City:</strong> Indeed. My overwhelming beauty just cannot be hidden! You are a wise Caster, you know that?</p><p><strong>Assassin of the Nightless City:</strong> I shall praise you. And you shall be rewarded.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Wow, a reward? What is it?</p><p><strong>Assassin of the Nightless City:</strong> My prized torture device! It&#39;s a cute fruit-shaped torturing tool! I just so happen to have three or four of them lying around, so you can have one!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> G-giving a torture device as a reward is...a little weird...and it&#39;s shaped like fruit...fruit...?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Uh, we might have SOME interest in it. Maybe. Is it cute?</p><p><strong>Assassin of the Nightless City:</strong> Of course it is!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> I do love a good scary story, but being given a tool for torture is...well, you know...</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> ...It makes me feel a little like...a dragon...you know?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Ah-choo!</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong> Oh my. Hehehe. The children are all running about the halls so energetically.</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong> Seeing them like this brings back memories of my own little Kintoki when he was young...</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong> Oh yes. And I can only imagine Master was a cute little child too. Heehee.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> It sounded as if those children were talking about torture or something... Well, I suppose I can let that slide.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> I&#39;m just glad to see children so happy. Children...children...</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> There seems to have been quite the increase in the number of children around here. Well not exactly, since they&#39;re actually Servants...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Yeah. Maybe it&#39;s time we thought of adding kids&#39; meals to the menu...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> We do have something like that for young Servants who can&#39;t eat full portions, but that&#39;s not much fun.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> A dish beloved by many, yet both popular and easy to eat... I&#39;ve been avoiding it this whole time because it&#39;s so easy...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> But maybe it&#39;s time to offer the forbidden mild-flavored curry?</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> I like it! Good idea!</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> ...But we&#39;re going to be slammed during Nero Fest. Do we really have the time to be adding new dishes to the menu right now?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> We&#39;ll cross that bridge when we come to it. Besides, we have more Servants to help in the kitchen now.</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong> Say no more. When you think of curry, you think...hurry for curry!</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong> Which means, we need someone who&#39;s speedy in the kitchen! This cat knows just the one to fit that bill!</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong> A man who&#39;s only effective when the sun is in the sky!</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong> That would be Sir Gawain! He&#39;s sure to cook up a great pot of curry real fast, since he&#39;s only got so much time to work with!</p><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong> Yeah, but let&#39;s not invite Lip over. We wouldn&#39;t want Sir Gawain to be distracted and stop his work, now would we?</p><p><strong>Minamoto-no-Raikou:</strong> Heh. Oh my. So he is only powerful when the sun is out? What a wonderful trait.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> You really...think so?</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong> ...What? I do not want to hear of this, even from you.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong> I have no wish to involve myself in such trivialities. To think you would come to visit me, only to babble about the Roman Emperor&#39;s absurd festival.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong> I always thought of you as a brave man who might be frivolous even on the battlefield, but this is something else entirely.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong> Begone, Archer.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong> Oh? That&#39;s an unexpected response from you, Pharaoh.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong> You don&#39;t like festivals? I thought you were the type of king who didn&#39;t mind your citizens having fun.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong> Of course not. I do not care what the citizens do for pleasure. The whole universe is within my grasp! I am a tolerant pharaoh, you know!</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong> But listen. I and I alone decide what I do. The very thought of the great pharaoh participating in an ancient Roman festival is laughable!</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong> Maybe so, but why don&#39;t you think it over? Think of it as a breath from our hectic lives...</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong> But it wouldn&#39;t be bad to go and test your strength either. Think about it: we&#39;re in Chaldea, where all sorts of Heroic Spirits gather from around the world.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong> Your participation would make this festival even more exciting.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong> ...Hmph. You are a smooth talker.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong> Besides. I think it&#39;s about time you met the other guy.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong> When you two meet, it should be on an appropriate stage where Servants can safely fight. A battle between you\u2013the Sun King\u2013and him would be much too dangerous to take place in Chaldea itself.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong> Hm?</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong> No, nothing...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> (I-is that...)</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> (Could that be Pharaoh Ozymandias!? So he is finally attending the ancient Roman festival!)</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> (I-I cannot stand idly by! Should the Pharaoh be on the move, Nitocris must also take action!)</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong> Nitocris.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> Yes! Pharaoh Ozymandias! What is your order!?</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong> I have warmed to the idea of going. I trust you to hold the fort while I&#39;m away.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> ...Eh? Uh...um...well, I...!</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong> Hahaha. Leave the guarding to the Sphinx. It&#39;s no fun for her to stay behind during a festival. Don&#39;t you agree, big bro pharaoh?</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong> Heh. Indeed.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong> We will go together then, Nitocris! Ready yourself!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> Yes!</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong> Mr. Hijikata? Hijikata? How much longer do you plan on sitting there munching pickles?</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong> The event&#39;s starting. The event! I know it&#39;s not a super giant one, but...</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong> But with all the Servants who&#39;re participating, this might actually turn into a big deal!</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong> This is one of the best opportunities to demonstrate Tennen Rishinryu\u2013err, the Shinsengumi, that we&#39;ll ever get!</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong> This is also our chance to get ahead of Nobbu!</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong> Come on now! I know you like things like this, Mister Hijikata!</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong> ...Well, okay, so you may not measure up to me when it comes to official matches...</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong> But you have your eye-blinding, sand throwing, anything goes killer \u201CBaragaki\u201D technique.</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong> Using your ultimate Tennen Rishinryu spirit that the audience would sure to be judgmental of, let&#39;s show who&#39;s boss!</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> ...Quit your yapping.</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong> Awww.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> ...Well, I couldn&#39;t say much for other events like races, but I suppose a festival like this is a different matter.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> I like the idea of fighting these other folks to the death.</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong> ...Um, killing isn&#39;t allowed.</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong> Hey, wait a minute. Mr. Hijikata? I thought you were munching on pickles because you weren&#39;t interested?</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> ...Don&#39;t get the wrong idea. I was just filling up so I wouldn&#39;t be fighting on an empty stomach.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> Let&#39;s go, Okita.</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong> That&#39;s the spirit!</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong> Ah, brings back memories of our training hall days. I&#39;ll get a few great Okita victories under my belt!</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> Talk big when you win, Okita. You&#39;re embarrassing yourself. Okay.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> Shinsengumi, move out!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> ...Yo, hold it right there, Miss Dark Saber.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> What?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> Aren&#39;t you that alternative Servant of the King of Knights of the Round Table?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> Yet you&#39;re different than usual. I sense a tenseness...a tingling sensation from you. You&#39;re so revved up, it&#39;s electrifying.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> What is your point?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> Okay. Let me get straight to the point, straight as the cutting edge of a blade!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> You&#39;re a Rider, right? That means you got some kinda mount or machine, yeah?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> I saw ya race a while back, but that was that red&#39;n&#39;gold emperor&#39;s ride, right?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> Bumpin&#39; into you must be fate! Would ya mind showing me your darkness machine!?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Fufu. Show a bit of mercy if he&#39;s bothering you. This little brat was itching to join the race.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> But NOBODY asked him to participate. He was so dejected, he&#39;s acting all funny.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Boys are such strange creatures. So keep that in mind and don&#39;t get too angry, okay?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> Wh-what!? What the hell!? When did you show up!? And you&#39;re wrong! No! Absolutely not! No, no, no!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> I ain&#39;t dejected or actin&#39; weird, okay!? Quit makin&#39; up stuff about me!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Fine, fine. Look at those pouty lips. You&#39;re just like a child.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Want a piece of candy? Or maybe a soft dumpling that&#39;s easier to chew?</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> HEY! Quit treatin&#39; me like a kid!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...I see now. If he is no more than a child, there&#39;s no need for me to raise my mop over this.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Sakata Kintoki. If you seek a place to direct your pent-up youthful energy...</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> I suggest you participate in the tournament that Emperor Nero is holding. I&#39;m sure a handful of hot-blooded folks have gathered again this year.</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> Hey, I ain&#39;t\u2013</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Yes, yes. Be a good boy and stop bothering this nice lady. Now, let&#39;s go to the festival.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Oh yes. Fufufufu. If you behave yourself, maybe I&#39;ll buy you a candy apple...</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> I said NO THANK YOU! Geddit through your head!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Hnnnn! This is going to be my year!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> I, Xuanzang Sanzang, will win for sure this year! A whole buncha stuff happened last year that prevented me from winning!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> So...Touta! I choose you to accompany me!</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong> Wait a minute. You&#39;ve got it all wrong. Think back on what happened last year.</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong> It&#39;s true this is a competition for Servants to test their strength, but this tournament&#39;s different. It&#39;s not about finding a single victor.</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong> It&#39;s neither an elimination competition nor is it a round robin battle. They&#39;re just one-off battles on a grand stage, each for a brief moment.</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong> Besides, you&#39;re a monk. A great monk at that.</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong> Getting enthusiastic over brawls wouldn&#39;t be right. I&#39;m just saying you should probably focus on hitting the wooden drum Mokugyo.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Oh, that hollow-sounding thing! Nice!</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong> ...That&#39;s your reaction?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Well, yeah. It&#39;s not that everyone&#39;s fighting to kill. Everyone&#39;s participating to better themselves, as a part of training.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> They&#39;re not focused on winning. But since it&#39;s for training, we should go beyond all out!</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong> I guess...you could think of it that way.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> And so! This year for sure! I will! Positively! Win! (Grin)</p><p><strong>Tawara Touta:</strong> (Hmmm. So this is what desire looks like... Now then. At this rate, I wonder when will the great Monk Sanzang actually reach enlightenment...?)</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> No assaults in the night, no assassination, and no surprise attacks, huh? And on top of that...</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> No killing. What a buzzkill. This event really will be hard on us Assassins.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> Hahahaha. Then the only thing you can do is REBEL. Wonderful! All forms of treachery will be permitted!</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> Ah, Rome! Ah, the emperor! Truly a vain embodiment of a multitude of tyrannies and oppression, all in one place!</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> Oh hey, Spartacus. You get my drift.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> What do you think? Want to try running amok without restraint one time? Surely you&#39;re tired of living in Chaldea with a bunch of emperors and kings all around.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> If you&#39;re in it, then I will...</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> Hahahaha! Indeed! We have the right to rebel against all these tyrannies, smash down insolence, while the pride of the mighty is crushed!</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> And at the same time, we shall use this opportunity to clear the air of our pent-up grudge! We have the right to such joy at this festival!</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> Hmph. I get it now.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> This may be an event run by an authority, but you will allow such a thing to be run as long as there are people who enjoy such event. Am I correct?</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> You seem more calm and levelheaded than I am, Spartacus, the forever rebellious one.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Oh, it&#39;s you, Master. Go away.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Ah, an expression of opinion similar to one oft expressed! I regret to say this myself, Master, but I am of the same opinion as he.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Getting right to the point in a story is important, and he is the right man for the job. What he means is: anything mightier than the pen is positively brutish!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> That is to say, we are unfit to participate in this particular event.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> A recreation of the festival of Olympia? An elegant and beautiful show of battles in the Colosseum?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> No. Wrong.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> This tournament is quite clearly an event for the physically fit. The question, though, is one of what is being promoted here.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> It&#39;s simply a shot in the arm made to entertain the readers\u2013I mean, the citizens.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Nothing more. Nothing less. I must regretfully inform you that we are not needed here.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Seriously? I thought this was a festival glorifying me! What a surprise! I didn&#39;t think THAT was its purpose!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Well, I do not recall permitting such festivities, as they have nothing to do with pharaohs...so I did have a sneaking suspicion...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Either way, it is a good thing for a nation to thrive!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> I am sure the economic effects are great. If proper measures were put in place beforehand, that is.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> I wonder if Her Imperial Majesty had that in mind? I wouldn&#39;t mind taking a bit of her time to give a presentation...</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Go do that on your own time. This study is exclusively for the writer-Servants of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Oh come now, don&#39;t say such a thing. I&#39;d rather not simply confine myself to the same perpetually glum faces, ever harassed by deadlines...</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> This beaming pharaoh&#39;s presence certainly brightens up our space, after all. The light of her divine beauty...</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Ah, what better inspiration to get our creative juices flowing!? As you can already see, my creative motivation is on the rise!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Why thank you, Shakespeare. But I am afraid you are somewhat lacking in muscle. You really must take better care of yourself.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> You certainly do favor married women...</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> No, no, no! Nothing like that! And to prove it...I have the perfect individual to back me up!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Well, he IS here, but...well, as long as you&#39;re all right with it...</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Hm? It appears study room A is a bit rowdy. Do you suppose Master stopped by?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Well, no matter. It is just the two of us in study room B, after all.</p><p><strong>Caster of the Nightless City:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Beautiful. You truly are beautiful. You may be concealing that beauty with a veil, but I can tell.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> You are an exquisite beauty who shines not by the sun&#39;s light, but a beauty who whose luminance is best viewed at night, by starlight.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Yet as a fellow Servant, I&#39;m sure you have considerable power on the battlefield.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> You show no sign of that, though. Beautiful as you are, you are surely dangerous as well.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> And that is what truly intrigues me.</p><p><strong>Caster of the Nightless City:</strong> ...Please stop, Lord Caesar.</p><p><strong>Caster of the Nightless City:</strong> I am a Caster. Just a simple Caster. I am merely one of many Servants who has formed a contract with Master.</p><p><strong>Caster of the Nightless City:</strong> You may try to woo me with honeyed words, but I dare not answer them.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Say no such thing. You can trust me.</p><p><strong>Caster of the Nightless City:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> I am an able man. Let me prove that much to you.</p><p><strong>Caster of the Nightless City:</strong> You mustn&#39;t...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Lord CAAAEEESAAAR!?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Wha...!?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> You have apologized and begged my forgiveness countless times...and STILL you... Who exactly is that...woman...!?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> I...well...</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Oh.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Do not \u201Coh\u201D me, Caesar. It seems your heart is as clogged with junk as your belly.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> It just so happens that a martial tournament is about to begin. So I have a wonderful idea.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> I will have you, Lord Caesar, participate and ask a bunch of Sabers to help you slim down.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> I...well...I don&#39;t...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Yes?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> ...Uh... Yes ma&#39;am. That might...not such a bad idea.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> (...Oh, my Caesarion. What shall I do? What do you think I should do?)</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AVoice of Caesarion:</strong> (It would help if you slimmed down a bit.)</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong> Mentor, Mentor!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong> I just heard! There&#39;s going to be a tournamament to test the strength of all Chaldea&#39;s Servants!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong> ...Um. This tournamament isn&#39;t going to require that Santas partici...um, join, right?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Not strictly speaking, no. But since it is such a grand event...</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> It would be a shame to simply ignore it. First of all, let&#39;s think about seasons.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong> Seasons?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Yes. Seasons change from summer to fall, fall to winter. I hear that fall is quite short.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> But I digress a bit. Anyway, it would be best to take time to train in the seasons prior to winter...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong> Oh I see! So if I train well during this tournament, I would become a great Santa by the time winter comes! How logimical!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> The word is logical, and it isn&#39;t!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> It&#39;s obviously a super sporty event! And Amakusa, stop talking nonsense!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong> Oh, hello, grown-up me. Please do not shout in the halls. You will bother the other Servants and staff.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong> And playing the role of Santa is a tough job. It requires a good, strong body, too, you know. Yes, it does. Argument won!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Don&#39;t give me that sh\u2013crap! And stop saying \u201Cargument won!\u201D</p><p><strong>Jeanne d&#39;Arc:</strong> Calm down, me. She&#39;s like our little sister. Make sure to treat her better than that, okay?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Ah, yes. You and I are surprisingly on the same page.</p><p><strong>Jeanne d&#39;Arc:</strong> ...Even that may happen once in a while...</p><p><strong>Jeanne d&#39;Arc:</strong> Right, Alter? As an older sister, you should\u2013</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> HELL!!! NO!!!</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong> ...Heh.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Don&#39;t lurk in a corner like that. Why don&#39;t you come out and talk with the others?</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong> ...My queen.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> See? Everyone seems to be having fun. Those good friends are talking with other like family.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> So many Jeanne d&#39;Arcs. Their existences and relationships are quite mysterious and...</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Wonderful. Don&#39;t you agree, Count?</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong> My Queen. I&#39;m afraid I have just happened to pass by.</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong> I have nothing to add to that scene. I have no strong feelings. Same goes with what I think. You might as well ask your general.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Oh. You think so?</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong> I do.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Oh...he disappeared. Did he dematerialize?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Hm. So he fled. With just a few more minutes, and I would have been able to treat his mental state.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Oh, hello, Nurse. What&#39;s going on?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Nothing. I have been attempting to treat that man for some time now, but he flees every time. He is not aware that he is injured.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Hehehe. Give him a rest. It&#39;s not nice to pester him so much.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> No. It is, I assure you, a part of the treatment.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> I see. Then if d&#39;Eon or Amadeus goes overboard during this festival, please treat them, okay?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Of course. You need not worry about that, Marie Antoinette.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Whenever an event or battle should arise, I will never hesitate to treat the wounded, regardless of what it may be that ails them.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> Wasteful. So terribly wasteful.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> The event itself is not the problem. A break is good for morale. No one can remain sane constantly staring down the jaws of death itself.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> But! This may be a simulator, but a waste is a waste!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> The device operates on Chaldea&#39;s system, too! Using it thoughtlessly is wasteful!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> Besides, what benefit is there to training so many Servants? If you want to train someone, train me! Me!</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong> Hmmm...the king of Uruk is surprisingly miserly.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong> I thought he was a king of luxury like me...who would spend extravagantly without a second thought...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> Fool. I&#39;m not stingy, but I am also a man who saves up! Listen well: one should only spend extravagantly after making a fortune!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> But look at Chaldea! Its power always runs at capacity, and its employees&#39; wages are never raised!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> Basic salary should always be increased every year, the fools!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> I&#39;m not saying that you need to be considerate of the older workers. I&#39;m only saying that one should be compensated according to their skills!</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong> Hm. That is sound advice. I&#39;ll keep it in mind. But being so stodgy and all-business is such a drear way to live.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong> The more glorious the festival, the better. Don&#39;t you agree?</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong> I understand your perspective, of course, but a simulator exists to be used, doesn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> Then just bear in mind the sheer amount of data that will create. The thing that&#39;s called...Sheba?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> If that thing&#39;s running at full capacity, day and night, Da Vinci is sure to get frustrated. The first part of the festival should be run modestly.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> After all, the preliminaries are mere battles between those up until four stars. It shouldn&#39;t concern a five star Servant like me!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> Fwahahahahahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong> Fuwahahahahahahahaha! I&#39;m just laughing along with you!</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong> Ah, that&#39;s the king Gilgamesh I&#39;ve heard of! The arrogant but mischievous sort that you just can&#39;t hate for some reason!</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> ...Ah, the one who walks the never-ending path.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> You are now in Chaldea, a place where numberless destinies intersect. Yet I notice that you purposefully avoid interacting with others.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> A foolish choice. Humans cannot live or act in isolation.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> So too with Rome. You must reflect and look back on your own path.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> ...My apologies.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> Holy Progenitor, Romulus. I am not Rome.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> Still, I shall keep those words of yours in my heart. But remember, I once fought against Rome itself.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> No, you are Rome.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> You are human, therefore you are Rome. Make no mistake: Rome and love reside within all people.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> Enjoy yourself. Even should you keep your face concealed, none will judge you.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> My Rome is the source of many joyous festivals. Do not forget, my child. People cannot live without joy.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> In other words...</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> Enjoy! Smile!</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> Okay, here we go!</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> ...Mahatma Change!</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> Our summer vacation has been extended! Hot places are still hot, so there&#39;s no reason not to let loose!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I see. This is not bad at all. However, I believe I shall join the authors to escape the summer heat.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> What are you talking about? You can&#39;t. You need to be out in the sun and move that body of yours sometimes.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> Contrary to what you say, you&#39;re well-versed in such activities, aren&#39;t you, Master of Baritsu?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Only in times of emergency. Besides, my Baritsu is intended for self defense\u2013</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> No more excuses! Come on, hurry to the Colosseum! Get to it!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> ...Seriously?</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> Yes, of course. You and I both are going on a mad dash!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AMash:</strong> Ah, so many...</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AMash:</strong> All the Servants with dauntless courage have assembled in Chaldea...

Battles to fulfill the purest of all competitive desires without profit or gain...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The stress of our daily lives, the exhaustion of so many battles eased, if only for a moment.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> It&#39;s a wonderful thing. A festival is necessary. Yes. I do understand that this event is important.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> But...that is why I have come to my own conclusion... I also want to fulfill my efforts...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> My powers have diminished compared to what they were during my lifetime, but I still want to be of some use to you.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I do not want to impede the path you take. I just want to be of help. Be your strength. I want to serve my purpose.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> That&#39;s why...I want to...</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AMash:</strong> I can&#39;t stop this anymore...can&#39;t stop this feeling.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AMash:</strong> I am a warrior of the Valkyries, created by the great god Odin.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AMash:</strong> I once served the gods...was no more than an automaton. Soon I met my love, Sigurd, and perished as a woman.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AMash:</strong> I am the Heroic Spirit Brynhild. I sit in the Throne, but have lost all my Authority as a god.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AMash:</strong> My sealed powers...many functions equivalent to Authority are awakening. I want them to. They&#39;re beginning to work. I want them to work.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AMash:</strong> Because...tonight, all the conditions will be met.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AMash:</strong> Many Heroes and great men participating in battle. So many warriors I am compelled to love.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AMash:</strong> But...yes, yes... I must choose. Watching all these heroes do battle...</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AMash:</strong> The time has come to select the most valiant of all heroes.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> ...Though not much blood will be spilled...</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> It will be all right. I will claim no souls. Valhalla, built for my father, the great god, is far from here.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> Even with much of my power and functions sealed, such things are nothing if I use a Primordial Rune.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> If I make even the slightest error in my calculations, I may lose my Spirit Origin...</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> ...But I don&#39;t mind.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> Before I disappear, I will fulfill my purpose...all that is asked of me.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> For you, I shall train the selected Servant and construct them anew.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> O...kay.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> I shall do it without N\xF3tt, the goddess of night, detecting me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Wait...Mash...I mean, you&#39;re...</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> It is fine. It will be fine.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> There is nothing to worry about. Please leave everything to me, Senpai, my Master.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> So please don&#39;t give me that sad look.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Altering Heroic Spirits. A pseudo-Palingenesis without a Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So that&#39;s what she meant. Now I understand.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The single most valiant Servant in Chaldea is selected, and a perpetual enhancement is applied by using the Primordial Rune...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That is likely her intent...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This is exactly what Sc\xE1thach and El-Melloi mentioned!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Mash!?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AMash:</strong> Senpai, my Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No, that&#39;s Brynhild!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m the real Mash Kyrielight. You are a true Heroic Spirit...a Valkyrie from Norse mythology!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Two...Mashes!?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AMash:</strong> Senpai, my Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No, that&#39;s Brynhild!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m the real Mash Kyrielight. You are a true Heroic Spirit...a Valkyrie from Norse mythology!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> And yet Senpai is confusing the two of us. It must be because of the Runes. Am I correct, Brynhild?</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We can avoid disaster if you just stop now. Well...the only thing that&#39;s really gone wrong so far is...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Nero, who figured something was going on, started to pout because her tournament was essentially used as a tool...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But if you stop now, I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll just laugh and forgive you. After all, nothing has happened yet.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Please, Brynhild.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> ...You really are a gentle child, Mash.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> Yes. You are indeed fit to be alongside Master. While you may not be overflowing with courage, you are full of determination.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> You certainly could be a Valkyrie of this modern era.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> But I&#39;m sorry. Truly sorry.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> I&#39;ve already begun to fulfill my purpose! Hero selection! Spirit Origin strengthening! Pseudo-Palingenesis!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Brynhild!</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> I can&#39;t stop it! It won&#39;t stop!</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> From here on, Chaldea&#39;s mightiest Heroic Spirit must be found to defeat me! My purpose is to modify, build, and strive for divine creation!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But such a feat is impossible to fulfill as a Heroic Spirit! Sc\xE1thach and El-Melloi said so!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Surely you understand this, too! So that&#39;s why you kept saying you may disappear...</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong> Words will not reach her. She&#39;s quite stubborn, you know.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What...!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That voice!</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> I am afraid you need to beat it into her. I recall a similar situation in the past.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> Put a swift end to it and resume the tournament. After all, stadium food is good civilization.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Altera!</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> I was wondering why I couldn&#39;t hear the incessant voice longing for Sigurd during the tournament.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> I never imagined you were so consumed by this, Brynhild.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> I apologize. I didn&#39;t realize your dilemma. But I will not neglect your cries anymore.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Siegfried!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> It is, of course, not only those two who have gotten involved, Mash.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> As I was the one who put some of these ideas in your head, it would be wrong of me to sit back and watch.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong> I knew something was strange! I thought Mash was less shield-y than usual.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong> Rather, I suspected she was more lance-y...and it turned out to be true!</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong> Because a shield + lance = me, Leonidas! Which means, according to my calculations, you are not Miss Mash!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Leonidas! Sc\xE1thach!</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong> And it&#39;s not just us! All the Servants who sensed Miss Brynhild&#39;s unusual behavior have come!</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong> We have assembled here!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> Well, it&#39;s a bit embarrassing to be introduced like that. The truth is that we just sensed something hinky.</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong> Um...I believe you sensed it better than that. You looked really worried... You looked almost like a pervert looking at prey.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> I&#39;m no pervert. Stalker at WORST! Besides, how would you know what I was thinking?</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong> Eh...? Well the moment you looked at Mash, you were oddly irritated and grumpy...</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong> You already have shifty eyes to begin with, but then you got even more awkward...and I was like \u201Cack.\u201D</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> (Irritated) Listen, you: I do not have shifty eyes.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> Chaldea is kind of like a campsite. It&#39;s only natural to monitor the health and wellness of everyone here.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> Who&#39;s not feeling good...who&#39;s acting strange...who&#39;s talking weird. Stuff like that.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> I&#39;m well versed in scouting. I&#39;d never miss any signs of anything or anyone about to go off an betray us.</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong> I see... But the fact remains that you look creepy when you&#39;re staring at everyone around the cafeteria.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> That&#39;s not the point. Were you even listening!? I think all the blood that should be in your brain ended up going to your breasts!</p><p><strong>Passionlip:</strong> I-it did not! And please stop scolding and punishing me like a know-it-all!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Oh, man, that is just, like, MEGA cringe. How &#39;bout you downvote that creeper style. For real.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> So this is the real Greenie? Super skeevy? Is he, like, out for the shrine maiden fox&#39;s number one spot?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> Like hell! I&#39;m a hunter! That fox and I are rivals when it comes to who hunts and who gets hunted.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong> Now, now, Lady Suzuka. The punishment in this case would be about muscle. There&#39;s no doubt he&#39;s talking about training one&#39;s muscles.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong> There is no difference in the muscles of men and women! Therefore, there is nothing to cringe about!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Seriously? Is that what Chaldea&#39;s like? Chaldea&#39;s all about that dudebro life, then?</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong> No, we are a group of intellectuals who prize careful calculation!</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong> But I can see that Lady Passionlip, Lady Suzuka, and Sir Robin get along well. Did you all fight alongside each other at some point?</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong> Anyway, Lady Mash and Fujimaru! The French contingent has come as well!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> If the holy maiden commands me, then I shall not waver. I had no idea that a Valkyrie of Northern Europe had concealed herself within this festival.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> I&#39;d like for this to end peacefully. If you stop now, it will be as if nothing happened.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> Let us have some tea instead. This message I bring from the queen herself, Brynhild.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong> There are still more warriors here to support you! Behold!</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Hey! We&#39;re here too! Come on, teacher! Don&#39;t lag behind! Come to the front!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> ...Why would you put a Caster on the front line?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Ah, now I see. Brynhild of Northern Europe. Even if you do really possess a true Primordial Rune...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> It would be best not to use its full strength here. Those runes hold the power of the great god of the Norse, Odin.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Worst case scenario, not only will your Spirit Origin be destroyed, you may create an anomaly that spreads through all of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Should that happen, even Master would not survive. For example, there may be a flux in magical energy through magical circuits...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> And phenomena that are otherwise impossible may occur within the space taken over by a Primordial Rune.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> But...why?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> You do not appear to be quite so mad...</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Teacher, you&#39;re talking too much!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> I do not recall accepting you as my pupil. What a peculiar twist of fate, considering who you become.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Oh don&#39;t be so mean, teacher. Gil came by because he is genuinely concerned.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Gil... Unbelievable...</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong> Ah, this display is almost like a teacher with his students on a school trip. It certainly lightens the mood here!</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong> So there you have it, Lady Brynhild! You may be a demigod...</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong> But you must see that you are outnumbered! Out of respect for Lady Mash&#39;s shield and everyone&#39;s concern, why don&#39;t you put down your lance?</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> The king gifted with brilliance is correct, Valkyrie.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> According to legend, you are seen as my younger sister in a way.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> As I am now, I have no memory of that...but the fact remains that we are somehow related.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> I cannot have you destroyed here. I have yet to properly speak with you.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> ...My sister.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> ...Lord Attil\u2013Altera...</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> The man so like my Sigurd... No, I am restraining my desire for Sigurd...</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> I will do what must be done... It is as simple as that.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> ...I also wanted to speak with you. But...</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> Why can&#39;t you? We&#39;re at a festival. There&#39;s no point in holding back.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> Use this place to air out dirty laundry or get on good terms with each other.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a bad idea. This old man thinks you should just talk when you have the chance.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> Well, if you can&#39;t, that&#39;s fine too.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> Argh! Dammit! That&#39;s annoying! Doesn&#39;t matter what is...you just gotta solve it with your fist!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> That&#39;s just shortsighted, Bear-Wolf Guy!</p><p><strong>Sakata Kintoki:</strong> Getting&#39; rough with girls ain&#39;t golden. After all, Riders are heroes!</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> Women and children got nothing to do with it if we&#39;re up against Heroic Spirits! And sorry to burst your bubble, but I&#39;m a Berserker!</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> Hmph. At least someone gets it...</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> If there&#39;s no choice but to push through, all you have to do is to stick to your values until the very end!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> He&#39;s right. It&#39;s not about being a woman or child.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Such a rule will always apply in places where lives are at stake. Be it Heroic Spirit or human, there&#39;s no difference.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Indeed. Though that does not mean it is futile to try to communicate.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong> Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Hahahahahahahaha! Ah, my sides hurt from all this laughing!</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong> That woman was crazy enough to point her lance at a God King&#39;s grand temple, MY temple! Words won&#39;t stop her!</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong> I suppose. I agree with you there.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong> ...Oh hey. You&#39;re here too, Master. If you&#39;re back to your old self, you&#39;d better get serious quick!</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> Yes, I agree.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> Her lance hasn&#39;t grown yet, so she doesn&#39;t have the power to wipe us all out in one swing.</p><p><strong>Arthur:</strong> If the plan is to restrain her, we must be quick. And then the rest is up to you, Master.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong> Hm?</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong> You&#39;re a new face, aren&#39;t you? Wait. Wait a moment. That armor...that voice...that bearing... Could you be...?</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong> Yeah, yeah. Right now we need to focus on the Valkyrie! If we don&#39;t stop her soon, we&#39;ll be goners!</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Stop this.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You don&#39;t need to modify Servants!</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> ...How troubling.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> I do not know what to say. Master, are you saying this has all been unnecessary?</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> When you look at me like that, it is clear that there is no need for me to continue down this egotistical path I have taken.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> Yes...behavior so selfish must be stopped immediately, I\u2013</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> ...I want to stop...at least I think I want to stop. But at the same time...</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> ...I feel I must create the strongest possible Heroic Spirit...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No, Brynhild!</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m sorry.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> I...I cannot hold myself back. I truly am an unstable Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> It...it will happen automatically. I will begin to love automatically.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Magical energy surge! Master, her Primordial Rune is activating!</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> I leave the commands to you, Master. It seems we have no choice but to settle this with our swords.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Prepare for battle!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Let&#39;s stop her!</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> Understood, Master!</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> ...Give me a blade. Show me all your power! The one who ends my life will be given the protection and blessing of Palingenesis!!!</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> Warriors! Be chosen! Heroes! Stop me!</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> Me me me... Me me me me me me me me meee!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Brynhild!</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> Master...!!!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> ...And that&#39;s how it went.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Chaldea&#39;s Master and [\u2642 his /\u2640 her] Servants managed to stop the out-of-control Valkyrie.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Oh, and the Valkyrie is quite safe. Her Spirit Core, too. In the end, she did not use a Primordial Rune.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Though this is indeed an interesting case study...</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> It all, luckily, ended well. As to what caused her to go berserk in the first place...</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> El-Melloi had some idea, but unfortunately he couldn&#39;t pinpoint exactly what it was.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> The important bit is that Chaldea is safe and sound.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> None of its systems, Sheba included, went out of control.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> It turned out not to be possible to locate another Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> At any rate, sorry to get your hopes up.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> ...What are you talking about?</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> If I recall, you mentioned something might happen before this tournament started.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> I had absolutely nothing to do with this. I am just relieved everyone is safe.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Let&#39;s just leave it at that.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I was interested in what you were going to do if you obtained a Holy Grail, but... Hahaha. You&#39;re a more cunning man than I expected.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Then I shall take my leave. You should at least enjoy this festival until its end.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> It&#39;s being held so everyone can relax. After all, everyone deserves a breather once in a while.</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> On the other hand...</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> Perhaps a minor bit of wickedness like that is more relaxing to you than anything else.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Hahahaha! I believe I&#39;ll have to duck that particular question, young man!</p><p><strong>Amakusa Shirou:</strong> ...Farewell.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> He really is a cunning man. Intriguing.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Now then. I suppose it&#39;s punishment time. I know you&#39;re skulking about, O Great Detective.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Not running away or hiding is unlike you. Have your habits changed now that you&#39;ve become a Servant?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Either way, you are the culprit. You were the one who caused Brynhild to go berserk.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Have you any proof?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> No physical evidence, obviously. I would not expect you to be so careless.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> But of course, I did come across the truth. Besides, Lord El-Melloi was the detective today.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> The reasoning via magecraft techniques approach is certainly interesting. But either way...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Even if there is no clear-cut evidence, there are always ways to find the culprit.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> While such a thing may be impossible for an ordinary man, it is surely not so for the Great Detective. I trust I needn&#39;t elaborate?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Heh. So what you&#39;re trying to say is...</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I&#39;m busted.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> (Nod)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> The only thing that remains unclear is whether you knew her rampage could be stopped at the last minute.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Hope for tomorrow!</p><p>(Runs away)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Baritsu!!! (Gentlemanly kick!)</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Ow...it looked like you didn&#39;t put your whole weight on it, yet it still stings...! Are you sure that move&#39;s not against the rules!?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Helena was right. I&#39;m glad I participated in the festival. It was good to move about a bit.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> Master...I wish to formally apologize.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> I&#39;m sorry for all the trouble I caused. I am a terribly unstable Servant...</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> But Master. Please know that I will do my utmost not to make trouble for you anymore.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> Leonardo da Vinci gave me a gift.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> She used a portion of Chaldea&#39;s resources to create a device that will make sure my operational status remains normal.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> It may not be completely flawless, but I feel more secure than I did before.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> Should I...act strange...again...</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> ...Please do not hesitate to break me. Until that time comes, I will be your strength.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I won&#39;t break you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It&#39;s okay. You&#39;ll never go berserk again, Brynhild.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> ...Yes, Master.</p>',656),a=[s];function i(h,g){return e(),o("div",null,a)}var l=t(r,[["render",i],["__file","nerofest2019.html.vue"]]);export{l as default};
