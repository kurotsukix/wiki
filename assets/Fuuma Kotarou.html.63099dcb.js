He taught others the basics of the shinobi, its philosophy and logic.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> But that wasn&#39;t enough. Not nearly enough.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> As long as one&#39;s memory is fresh, passing the teachings through oral instruction is the most accurate method. But as life goes on and one&#39;s memory begins to fade, that method becomes less reliable.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> At that point, recording teachings in text is the best method, but its accuracy is then questioned.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> In order to perfect the ninjutsu that Fuuma created, oral instruction and a clear mental acuity so one neither forgets nor is forgotten are best.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong> So you&#39;re the fifth leader of the clan.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I shake my head in denial. As long as the fourth leader still lives, I am not the fifth leader.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong> Incorrect. You will soon be the fifth leader. And the shinobi techniques that I have been entrusted with must be passed along to you in order for you to become what you are destined to be.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong> Everything...I shall teach you and pass down everything. Now please...give me your hand.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> And from then on, until I grew to adulthood, I called her Mother.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Every time I called her that, she would tilt her head as if confused. But in my mind, anyone who teaches somebody something is to be considered a parent.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> That&#39;s why I thought I should call her Mother.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The age of the shinobi was coming to an end. The Houjou clan perished, and the nation was being unified.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The Fuuma clan was convinced that their end was near. The Fuuma as ninjas, at the least, would end here.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong> Yes, that&#39;s what the times have become.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> It&#39;s a shame for the Fuuma clan to perish. But there are still ways to survive.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Even if it meant taking on the guise of a burglar or a thief in order to keep the Fuuma clan alive...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> But should that happen...what would happen to you?</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong> Do not worry yourself over that. I can no longer move anyway.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong> For five generations, I have been watching over the Fuuma.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong> My operational period is long since passed, and I can no longer recall the faces of the previous leaders.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong> The techniques of the shinobi...even throwing a shuriken...all gone from my memory.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong> The only thing that remains within me is...your face.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong> That&#39;s why, I ask that you do the role of my kaishaku, to behead me, in one sweep. I am asking you, personally, to do this for me.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong> And by doing so, I can declare you to be my greatest accomplishment and masterpiece of the Fuuma clan.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong> The strongest...the last...the best ninja.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...My memory is a bit hazy. There&#39;s no way I could remember everything in my past life.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Ah...but what did I do right after that?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master. We have failed to summon Katou Danzo.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Okay.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> According to our staff&#39;s analysis, it appears there was an error in the summoning path.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We don&#39;t understand the cause of the error.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Yes. And that&#39;s why [\u2642 Mister /\u2640\uFE0F Miss} Fujimaru...you will be heading over to the...\u201Cother\u201D Japan.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Holmes?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Based on what I heard about the dream you had...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> If an error occurred in summoning Katou Danzo, its source likely lies in this dreamed-of Japan.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> You will need to settle the matter there.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> That woman you fought is the worst. I&#39;m sure she has no intention of becoming a Servant here.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> But that one planted some seeds and left them behind. Think of this as one of them sprouting.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> And it has, in turn, caused this error.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> But I thought...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Wait, I thought we couldn&#39;t go back?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Precisely. And that&#39;s why you should head over there in its proper time.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> In that timeline, she&#39;s there. So go save her.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> And do you know which Servant should accompany you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I&#39;ve already asked Miss Da Vinci to prepare a Rayshift. Now go and settle this once and for all.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;ll go call him.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Yes, do so. It&#39;s about time for him to settle matters.</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> ...Going to that...proper age of that time?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> ...I see. Then yes, it makes sense for me to accompany you.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> Not just as a Servant, but as Fuuma Kotarou...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> I will happily accompany you, my Master.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> But first, I will need to prepare.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Prepare?</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> Yes. With this Spirit Origin form, I&#39;m a little concerned about my defenses.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> ...Nin!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFuuma Kotarou:</strong> Spirit Origin, released. Now I can fight with my full power.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That was ninpou...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That was ninjutsu...</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AFuuma Kotarou:</strong> It&#39;s very similar to magecraft.</p><hr><p><strong>E\uFF1AFuuma Kotarou:</strong> Now let&#39;s head out. To that time period...to the village of the Fuuma...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The Fuuma flourished for five generations, and those who learned the Fuuma technique numbered well over one hundred. But in my opinion...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The one who reached the Fuuma&#39;s true ideal was its fifth leader. And only him.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> He, in whose veins runs the blood of an outsider, and the blood of the oni, made manifest through magecraft.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> His blood was mixed, and he himself had incredible latent ability.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Naturally talented...is perhaps the best way to describe him. That innate talent was what the first Lord Fuuma strove to have; to be a ninja exactly like him.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> But there was one thing that god did not grant him.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> It was the desire for praise. The drive to get to the top, even if it meant sabotaging others, just did not exist within him.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Had he possessed such characteristic, no doubt he would have been quietly by the bedside of the general who unified the nation.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> As a result, the Fuuma clan was on the verge of extinction. Or rather...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The Fuuma clan&#39;s goal had likely been accomplished the moment the fifth Fuuma Kotarou was born.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The greatest shinobi, who, though human, brought the power of the oni with him.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Perhaps that was the first leader&#39;s\u2013and Kashin Koji&#39;s\u2013aim.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> No... I am only a puppet. Such things are not my concern.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...I digress.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Some memory or record of mine was just wiped.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I had no purpose in living...no purpose in dying.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Ah...so then why am I here? Why do I stay here? Why am I bound here?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Even though there is something I need to do...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Yes. We&#39;re detecting a strong magical energy response...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;ll be all right.</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> I&#39;m fine, Lady Mash.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> No matter who she is, or what she is, our objective is the same.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> And I must be the one to complete this task.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> Not as a Servant or as an Assassin, but as Fuuma Kotarou, fifth leader of the Fuuma Clan.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> This is my burden to bear.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> Master, I am so sorry for dragging you into this!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> Underlings are approaching. I will eradicate them. Please stand watch, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I don&#39;t remember... I don&#39;t remember whether I beheaded her as she asked or not.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I believe I would have been able to do it, but I regret that I could not.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Both sentiments are there, giving me pain.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong> I could never get used to being called Mother.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong> Whenever I was called that, something inside me squeaked, so I...oiled it.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong> I thought that, over time, being addressed that way would become second nature to me.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong> Mother. Did I ever do anything to deserve that title?</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong> The only thing I did was continue to teach the techniques of the shinobi to each generation.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong> Faster than yesterday, higher than yesterday, smarter than yesterday, stronger than yesterday.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong> I was merely a being, a puppet, meant to make him that way. Ever since my own operational period ended, that was what I decided.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong> I have no right to be called a mother.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong> No, you&#39;re wrong.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong> It was fine. That was enough.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong> We only had one objective. To complete the Fuuma clan.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong> So please do not belittle that fact. You did everything in your power.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong> And especially...whenever I perfected a technique, you always said to me:</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong> Yes, excellent work, Lord Kotarou.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong> Those words alone were the greatest reward for me. That was all that I needed.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong> They held such strong sentiment. Even if it was as minute as a dew drop, that was enough. No, I didn&#39;t need anything more.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong> Had I been fulfilled, I wouldn&#39;t have become complete. Being hungry for the smallest of sentiment was enough.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong> That&#39;s right. So, please...do not try to satisfy my needs.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong> Your very existence is what fulfills me. Such sentiment is usually unnecessary to a shinobi.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong> Oh, but...perhaps I had already...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong> ...served my purpose. And now that I&#39;m not needed anymore, I am merely junk.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong> Perhaps that&#39;s why I find something so simple so fulfilling.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> We&#39;re almost at the village of the Fuuma.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> This era was somewhat peaceful, but it was quite tumultuous for me personally.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> Our days were not calm, and our fates unclear.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> We fought, we killed, we pillaged... We fought, we were killed, we were pillaged...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> Despite our actions, we were all desperate to find our destiny.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> As we were searching for some shining place without light, we mindlessly practiced our techniques.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Did you ever regret it?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> No. Absolutely not. I never had a single ounce of regret.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> Just like you, Master. I have never felt regret.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Nothing came of that?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> ...Yes. You&#39;re absolutely right. Nothing at all came about from our efforts.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> In extreme terms, the name Fuuma left a mark in history.</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> ...We&#39;ve taken a bit of a detour it seems.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> Were she here, she would be somewhere dark, where no light could reach.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> She did not like the sun, because she always believed that it mocked and ridiculed her.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> ...But I never thought so. She was a beautiful combat doll, and she was the one person I opened up to.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master, Kotarou...I&#39;m getting an intense response.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;ve scanned the topography. There seems to be a cave five hundred meters ahead.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> She&#39;s likely there.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> Thank you. Then let&#39;s go, Master.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I did not like bright places. I hid that by saying it was because I was a shinobi.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> A lie that even children can see through. But I didn&#39;t want to be seen.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I hated myself, more than anyone else. But without that hatred, I would not be a shinobi.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> A shinobi first and foremost works from the heart. Without it, I would just be an inanimate object.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Voices... I hear voices.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Oh, human voices. Don&#39;t come in here...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Something dear to me is hidden here. Something special is sealed away.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I must protect this place, or else I would no longer be Katou Danzo...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> Please stand back I believe we have arrived.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Go away... Go away... Please. I beg of you.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> Mother.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Who...? It doesn&#39;t matter... I need to protect this place...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> No, you do not. You must leave this grave to time now.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> A shinobi is destined to disappear like dust. But...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> Her lingering thoughts must have been used and manipulated by an abominable entity...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Can you stop it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Can you fight her?</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> Of course. This is why I came along.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Who...are you...?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> I will answer once I&#39;ve destroyed you! Engaging!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> Yah! Die!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> All enemy signals have disappeared. Good work, Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I will make preparations for your return. Please wait.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> No. There&#39;s one thing that needs to be done. Let&#39;s keep going, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Okay. Let&#39;s go.</p><hr><p><strong>Danzo:</strong> ...Who...?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> ...I am the fifth leader, Fuuma Kotarou.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong> ...That name...oh...are you...really...the fifth leader?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> Do you remember me?</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong> No...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong> But...Fuuma...is here... It&#39;s right...here...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> This must be the grave. Our grave. The Fuuma clan&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> Those who were left to die in the elements...those who have gone missing...those who were abandoned...or those who simply died...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> It&#39;s the unknown and unmarked grave of us as ninja. Your task was to protect this place and to raise the next generation.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong> Yes...that&#39;s why...I must...raise the next...Fuuma...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong> That is my duty. The purpose of my existence.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> There&#39;s no need for that anymore.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> Katou Danzo. In the name of the fifth leader, I hereby relieve you of your duty.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong> I...refuse... There is no proof...that you are the fifth leader...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong> His face, his voice, and even his scent...all gone from my...memories... The truth...I no longer have...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> Then touch me, Katou Danzo.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> This flesh of mine has been shaped by the Fuuma. Should you touch me, you will understand.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong> ...Ah...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong> Fuuma...Fuuma Kotarou... My...their...coveted completed form...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong> ...Then the final swing of a sword... If you are truly the real Fuuma Kotarou...you know what to do...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> Of course.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Eh...!?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> Kaishaku...assisting you by beheading.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> I, Fuuma Kotarou, shall see this task be carried out.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> I will see to it that the Fuuma line ends here. That this is the end of the shinobi&#39;s journey.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> Because that is our conviction.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong> Yes...precisely... Ah...even though I cannot see...I can tell...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong> The Fuuma...I have...most definitely...reached the end...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong> I&#39;m glad...even with all my memories gone...I&#39;m glad to be able to see this conclusion...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong> Thank you, fifth one...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> ...No. The Fuuma should be the one thanking you.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> Mother. Please have a pleasant journey.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong> Mother... Mot...her...</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong> Ah, that word...brings back memories...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> Master, I know this may be pointless...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> But would you mind if I dig a grave?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Want me to help?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> Thank you, Master. But actually, I want to do this on my own.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Sure.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> Thank you. Then...if you would give me a moment.</p><hr><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> No grave marker, no posthumous name. Just numerous unnamed shinobi.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> But at the same time, that is something to be proud of. That&#39;s what it means to be one of us.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> We do not strive to be celebrated. We take pride in our anonymity.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> I&#39;m sure my grave is somewhere here too. Marked not as Fuuma Kotarou, but as an unnamed shinobi.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> And now, Katou Danzo has finally joined us. One of the few who knew the first leader&#39;s techniques.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> She completed educating and raising the fifth leader, and she understood that her duties were fulfilled.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> I&#39;m satisfied. Yes, what a wonderful ending.</p><p>I was able to include her to be one of us...as \u201Cjust\u201D another ninja.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> Ah, but...just one last thing...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> At the very end, I unthinkingly called her \u201CMother.\u201D</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Good work, Master. And I have some news.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> With the correction of the Singularity that you were just in, a new Spirit Origin was added to our list.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It is:</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> \u201CBlack Kite\u201D?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Katou Danzo?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes!</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong> Nice to meet you. You must be the fifth Fuuma Kotarou.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> That&#39;s right. You must be Katou Danzo.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong> Perhaps because my Spirit Origin was damaged, I have no memories of my past, other than my battle data.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong> I do recall that I had something to do with the first Lord Fuuma, but...</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> ...I see. If we return to the village of the Fuuma, we should be able to find your grave.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> Though, we are in a completely different time period. I am the fifth leader.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong> Yes. It appears that I was most active as a shinobi long before you were born.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong> That is what Da Vinci has told me. So, this is the first time we have spoken.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong> ...Well, I&#39;m relieved. So the Fuuma really did fulfill their dream.</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong> After all, you, a perfect shinobi, did indeed come to be.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> (...That was all thanks to your help.)</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> (Everything that you did... Even the fact that I stand here today...all of it is thanks to you.)</p><p><strong>Danzo:</strong> Hm? Is something wrong?</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> ...I forgot to properly introduce myself.</p><p><strong>Fuuma Kotarou:</strong> It&#39;s a pleasure to meet you, Katou Danzo.
