This is great for the Shinsengumi.</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong> Haha, guess it&#39;s all thanks to my amazing exploits, right?</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> Don&#39;t get cocky. This isn&#39;t nearly enough as far as I&#39;m concerned.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> We&#39;re gonna make sure Kondou becomes the next great daimyo.</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong> Great daimyo, huh? You really are dreaming big, Mr. Hijikata.</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong> Then I guess I&#39;ll just have to make sure we keep winning even more spectacularly!</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong> Oh, but for now, I&#39;ll go get Mr. Harada and the others!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Um, there&#39;s something I think you should know...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I have to tell you that Okita&#39;s, well...</p><hr><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> ...Never mind that.

Our blades were just no match for their guns.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> But next time&#39;s gonna be different. Once we get guns of our own at Edo, then we&#39;ll show them a thing or two.</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong> Boy, nothing gets you down, does it, Mr. Hijikata!</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong> Guess I&#39;d better start learning how to use a gun myself, then.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> Never mind that. You just get some rest. Can&#39;t have you collapsing after getting some sea air again.</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong> Yeah, yeah, I know.</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong> My point is, I&#39;m going to make sure next time will be a BIG VICTORY for us!

Not even close.</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong> What the!? What happened to you, Mr. Hijikata!? Why&#39;re you wearing that!?</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> Looks pretty good on me, doesn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> Our whole squad&#39;s got all-new Western-style weaponry. We&#39;re not letting SatChou get away with this anymore.</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong> I see... So, you&#39;ve got the new outfit and gun too, huh, new [\u2642 guy /\u2640\uFE0F girl}? And you said the Shinsengumi&#39;s new name is the Kouyou Chinbutai?</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong> Guess this means the glory days of the katana are over.</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong> I may be a genius with a sword, but I sure never imagined I&#39;d see the day it became useless.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> ...We&#39;re heading off to Koushu soon. We&#39;re going to intercept SatChou at Koufu Castle.</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong> I see...</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong> I know I can&#39;t go with you, so...</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong> ...please take good care of Mr. Kondou in my stead.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> ...See you around.</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong> ...You too.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Okita...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Are you sure there&#39;s nothing else you wanted to say to her?</p><hr><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> ...Yeah.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> ...Don&#39;t worry, Okita.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> ...The Shinsengumi&#39;s not going anywhere.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> ...I won&#39;t let it.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> ...Come on. It&#39;s a long way to Koushu.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> You want me to lead the whole army...?</p><p><strong>Sendai Clansman:</strong> That&#39;s right. You commanded your soldiers magnificently during the battle at Utsunomiya Castle.</p><p><strong>Sendai Clansman:</strong> Well? What do you say to putting your talents to use for the Oushu army?</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> ...All right. But on one condition. If I&#39;m going to be in charge, then I&#39;ll be running a much tighter ship.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> If anyone disobeys my orders, I need to be able to cut them down myself. I don&#39;t care how important they are.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> So I want you to give me absolute power over their lives. That all right with you?</p><p><strong>Sendai Clansman:</strong> U-um, that&#39;s, uh...</p><p><strong>Sendai Clansman:</strong> I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the sort of thing I can decide on my own...</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> Hmph... Coward.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> We&#39;re done here.</p><p><strong>Aizu Clansman:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Aizu Clansman:</strong> Who the hell does he think he is!? A damn upjumped man-slayer of a peasant!</p><p><strong>Aizu Clansman:</strong> Well, who needs him? We&#39;re more than strong enough to destroy those SatChou bastards all on our own!</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> ...Let&#39;s go, new [\u2642 guy /\u2640\uFE0F girl}. These people are hopeless.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> Enomoto&#39;s got a warship docked at the harbor. We&#39;re taking it to Ezo.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Ezo, huh...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That&#39;s even farther north...</p><hr><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> That&#39;s right. Our prospects&#39;ll be better with Enomoto than they will with those cowardly shogunate retainers.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> This isn&#39;t over yet.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> ...I&#39;m not letting the Shinsengumi end like this.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> ...Not as long as I still live.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> Listen up. The only way those SatChou bastards are getting here is through this narrow mountain path.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> We&#39;re going to set up camp on top of the mountain, and flank them from both sides.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> Wait for my signal before you attack, and keep your cool.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> Here they come...</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> ...Let&#39;s go, Shinsengumi!</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> FIRE!</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> Draw your swords and charge ahead! Cut them down from the flanks!!!</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> Focus on the enemy right in front of you! If anyone turns tail, I&#39;ll cut them down myself!!!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Enemy Soldier:</strong> How the hell are they this strong!? They told us these guys would be pushovers!</p><p><strong>Enemy Soldier:</strong> You&#39;re telling me they&#39;re supposed to be some mere shogunate stragglers to mop up!?</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> We&#39;re not the shogunate...</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> We&#39;re the Shinsengumi!!!</p><p><strong>Enemy Soldier:</strong> The Sh-Shinsengumi!?</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> The enemy&#39;s scattering! Kill every last one of them!</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> Advance, Shinsengumi!!!</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> That was our first big victory in a long time, Vice Commander!</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> Oh, right. It&#39;s Vice minister of the Army now, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> Don&#39;t call me that. Sounds wrong to me. Vice Commander&#39;s fine.</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> I had my doubts when we came to Ezo, but the way things are going now, we might just be able to drive those SatChou bastards back after all.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> That&#39;s right. SatChou won&#39;t be getting through Futamataguchi while we&#39;re here defending it. Not a one of them&#39;s so much as setting foot in Hakodate.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> You&#39;ve all been doing great, especially for how few of you there are.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> I wish I could give you a more fitting reward, but today you&#39;ll have to make do with booze.</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> Fine with me! I couldn&#39;t ask for a better reward right now.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> Hey now, don&#39;t go getting so drunk you cause a ruckus. Keep it to one drink for today.</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> Hahaha! Even after a victory like this you&#39;re still so strict! No wonder they call you the Demon Vice Commander!</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> Hey there, new [\u2642 guy /\u2640\uFE0F girl}. You boozing it up, too?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;ve really changed, Hijikata.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You haven&#39;t changed a bit, Hijikata.</p><hr><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> You think?</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> ...Maybe you&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> Tomorrow, I&#39;m heading back to Goryoukaku for reinforcements.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> You come too. There&#39;s a favor I want to ask you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Got it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> A favor...?</p><hr><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> You see, you and I are two of the last few Shinsengumi survivors out there.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> That&#39;s why I can only ask this of you.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> ...Go back to Edo.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> Find my family in Hino, and tell them everything that&#39;s happened with the war so far.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You can&#39;t be serious...</p><hr><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> You&#39;ll need this letter... Oh, and here, take this photograph with you, too.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> Heh. You know, I look pretty good in this. These photograph things aren&#39;t half bad.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m sticking with you to the very end!</p><hr><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> I&#39;m giving you an order, dammit! One more word, and I&#39;ll cut you down where you stand!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> My family in Hino&#39;ll take good care of you. Watch yourself out there, new [\u2642 guy /\u2640\uFE0F girl}.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> ...No, you aren&#39;t really the new [\u2642 guy /\u2640\uFE0F girl} anymore, are you.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> Let&#39;s see, I think your name was Ichimura...</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> No... It&#39;s you, Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You knew who I was all along?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Are these your memories, Hijikata...?</p><hr><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> Beats me... Servant minds are weird.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> I can&#39;t tell where the hell the memories begin and the illusions end.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> But at this point, it doesn&#39;t matter if these are my memories, or someone else&#39;s.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> Whatever happened here happened a long time ago.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> Back when all I cared about was my vow of loyalty.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> Still, as far as I&#39;m concerned, my Shinsengumi hasn&#39;t died yet.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> Now, go on...</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> This next part is my own personal hell.

There&#39;s no way we&#39;ll make it back alive!</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> Shut it! If I lose now, I won&#39;t even be able to show my face at Kondou&#39;s grave!</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> Listen up! If any of you turn tail on me, I&#39;m cutting you down myself!</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> Cut them up! Advance! Cut them up!!!
