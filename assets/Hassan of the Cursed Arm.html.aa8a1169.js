In that case, I am willing to offer my cooperation.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> By the way, have you found any clues?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It&#39;s a quite cunning group so the Emperor&#39;s men haven&#39;t been able to track them.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> If we don&#39;t know the location of their base, then there&#39;s not much we can do...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> So, that&#39;s why you were selected among many, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> We have a professional in that field. It&#39;s up to you, &quot;Old Man of the Mountain.&quot;</p><p><strong>Hassan:</strong> \u2013Hassan-i Sabbah, reporting.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Ohh, you&#39;re here already!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Yup. Greetings.</p><hr><p><strong>Hassan:</strong> \u2013Master, I&#39;ve already tracked them down. No matter how cunning they are in covering their tracks,</p><p><strong>Hassan:</strong> they can&#39;t trick the eyes of the Assassin class Heroic Spirits.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Excellent. I&#39;m worried about the children, Senpai! Let&#39;s hurry!!</p><p><strong>Kidnapper:</strong> What!? How&#39;d you bastards find us here!?</p><p><strong>Hassan:</strong> \u2013Ha! You&#39;re a joke. Confidence in that level of hiding...</p><p><strong>Hassan:</strong> You&#39;re third-rate bandits at best. Get a life, or change your ways right here.</p><p><strong>Hassan:</strong> Lucky for you, this Master is kind. Surrender and you won&#39;t be hurt.</p><p><strong>Kidnapper:</strong> Huh. Don&#39;t be cocky, bonehead! Get them, guys!!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I neutralized the enemy group, Master. I will tie them up on this tree.</p><p><strong>Hassan:</strong> I don&#39;t see any children...Their headquarters is somewhere else?</p><p><strong>Hassan:</strong> I will guide you there, Master. The cornered enemy may be dangerous.</p><p><strong>Hassan:</strong> \u2013Hurry!</p><p><strong>Children:</strong> Wahhhh...I want to go home...</p><p><strong>Kidnapper:</strong> Hey, walk straight, stupid brats!! You better stop crying!</p><p><strong>Kidnapper:</strong> What&#39;s the problem? We&#39;re gonna feed all you hungry rascals that have nothing to live on.</p><p><strong>Kidnapper:</strong> Let&#39;s do the best to get along, huh? I&#39;ll raise you all to be proper assassins!</p><p><strong>Hassan:</strong> \u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s enough!! Free the children!!</p><p><strong>Kidnapper:</strong> Damn!!

Hey!! Let&#39;s go!!</p><p><strong>Kidnapper:</strong> What!? The torch is out...!?</p><p><strong>Hassan:</strong> &quot;Zabaniya&quot;</p><p><strong>Kidnapper:</strong> Wha!? G-Gah...</p><p><strong>Hassan:</strong> Foolish. All too foolish. I do not mean using a child as a shield, or kidnapping children.</p><p><strong>Hassan:</strong> Nothing is as foolish as the one who cannot even measure talent trying to raise an assassin.</p><p><strong>Hassan:</strong> That child is unfit to be a killer. Such incompetence bringing children to this place\u2014</p><p><strong>Hassan:</strong> You are no longer worthy of living. Disappear into the eternal darkness.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Hassan!!</p><p><strong>Child:</strong> Wahhhh!! That was scary...!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> There, there. That was scary.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Uncle Hassan rescued you.</p><hr><p><strong>Child:</strong> ...Mister?</p><p><strong>Hassan:</strong> \u2014 Mission accomplished, Master.
