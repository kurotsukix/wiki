That was Trimmau, aka Volumen Hydrargyrum, the El-Melloi family&#39;s ultimate Mystic Code.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> She&#39;s my personal weapon, computer, and all-purpose maid, and as you&#39;d expect from an ultimate Mystic Code, she does a great job at all that stuff...</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> But now, hahaha, she just up and ran away on me!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Your Mystic Code...ran away?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Uh... How does a Mystic Code decide to run away?</p><hr><p><strong>Reines:</strong> No need to say anything more. I might not look like it, but trust me, I&#39;m embarrassed enough as it is.</p><hr><p>Note: Male Master</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> If you haven&#39;t yet learned to recognize when a fair maiden is feeling ashamed, you really should.</p><hr><p>Note: Female Master</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> You know what it&#39;s like for a maiden to feel ashamed too, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Reines:</strong> Anyway, now that I missed that chance to nab her...</p><p><strong>???:</strong></p><p>Aaaaaahhh!</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> Well, that didn&#39;t take long!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong> Pseudo-Servant detected. Proceeding with data collection.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> What&#39;s the meaning of this, Trimmau!?</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> Great. Just great.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Reines!? Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re behind this!</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> Dammit, of all the people I hoped wouldn&#39;t find out about this! Wait. Were you writing essays in the cafeteria again?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> It&#39;s an old habit of mine! The words come more easily when I&#39;ve got something to munch on!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Besides, the cafeteria&#39;s sandwiches are just too good. I can&#39;t resist them.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> Hahaha, I&#39;d say the ones from the caf\xE9 on Druid Street would give them a run for their money, but I got it.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> Anyway, why&#39;re you still writing essays at all? Did you forget you&#39;re a Servant now?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> I can&#39;t help it! When I make a new discovery, I can&#39;t relax until I&#39;ve written it down for posterity!</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> Fair enough. It&#39;s not like your obsessive tendencies are anything new at this point. Anyway, now that the Code&#39;s out of the bag, Brother, why don&#39;t you give me a hand getting it back in?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong> Data collection obstacle detected. Initiating ability-based obstacle elimination procedure.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Did it just duplicate itself!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Now it&#39;s pretending to be Ishtar and Par!?</p><hr><p><strong>Reines:</strong> Volumen Hydrargyrum only imitates outer appearances. I should be able to get it back once it&#39;s defeated.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> On that note, since Trimmau isn&#39;t with me I&#39;m sitting this one out, so I&#39;m counting on you two to beat her instead. Good luck!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> What have you pulled me into now!?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> Yup, this is definitely London.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> And based on the local architecture, it would seem the nineteenth-century setting was accurate as well.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> I don&#39;t see any other people around... Is that part of the settings, too?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Why would the Volumen Hydrargyrum come here?</p><hr><p><strong>Reines:</strong> Hmm. I have no idea.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> Aside from the lack of people, there doesn&#39;t seem to be anything strange or out of place.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> What&#39;s your tracking spell say?</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> Thanks to that bit I gathered earlier, I was able to get Trimmau&#39;s coordinates.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> But it&#39;s still going to take a little time to find her.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Then it seems now would be a good time for you to tell us more about this research of yours.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> Damn, so you didn&#39;t forget about that, huh?</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> Basically, like I said before, it boils down to how we can take advantage of Pseudo-Servants&#39; unique characteristics.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Like what?</p><hr><p><strong>Reines:</strong> Most Servants never grow or change.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> And why would they? They&#39;re all dead, after all.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> The moment they&#39;re inscribed in the Throne and given a Servant class, their form is pretty much set in stone.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> They can level up, sure, but that&#39;s really just a way of showing how close they are to their true capabilities.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> But the same isn&#39;t true for us Pseudo-Servants, is it?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> We&#39;re simultaneously dead, yet not dead. Alive, and not alive.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> I see. So that&#39;s where the Volumen Hydrargyrum comes in. It belongs to you, not Sima Yi.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> Exactly. I figured if I played my cards right, I could find a way to boost my combat capabilities.</p><p><strong>Sima Yi:</strong> And I thought the same, which is why I decided to help investigate this idea.</p><p><strong>Sima Yi:</strong> Specifically, I was adjusting the data to better acclimate the Volumen Hydrargyrum to my own Spirit Origin.</p><p><strong>Sima Yi:</strong> Both the Volumen Hydrargyrum and Lady Reines are old hands at that sort of tweaking, so if all goes well, it should unlock some new possibilities.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> I can&#39;t tell if that sounds more like something you would do, or something Lord Sima Yi would do... Either way, that&#39;s no exploit. That&#39;s an out-and-out cheat!</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> Huh, I&#39;m surprised you disapprove, Brother. I thought you liked video games.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Video games are designed with their own respective rules, and those rules need to be followed.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> One careless move, and you could end up destroying your entire Spirit Origin!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Please, Lord Sima Yi, try to talk some sense into\u2013</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Heeey! Can you guys hear me?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Da Vinci!</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I saw the simulator was booted up all of a sudden. Is something wrong?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Well...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> My professor, uh...</p><hr><p><strong>Reines:</strong> Wait, wait! I&#39;ll explain that part!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Now I see. I&#39;m surprised that Volumen Hydrargyrum would run amok on her own like that.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> I must have made a mistake with one of her settings or something. Believe me, I feel very silly.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> (Let&#39;s just keep the fact that I was hacking into Chaldea&#39;s database between you, me, and my brother, okay?)</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hmm...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Okay, got it. Now that I know what&#39;s going on, I&#39;ll keep an eye on all your vitals from here, too.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> (Phew. That was too close...)</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> It looks like your tracking spell is reacting again.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> Hmm. She&#39;s south of here, near Regent&#39;s Park.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> Come on, we&#39;d better hurry.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> Ooh, a fish-and-chips stand. Damn if it doesn&#39;t smell good.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> Go buy me some, will you, pupil?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Didn&#39;t you just say we should hurry?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Hm? I see the stand, but I don&#39;t see anyone working it...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It does smell good, but aren&#39;t we kind of busy now?</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> That&#39;s exactly why we need a snack to keep our energy up. ...Never mind. There&#39;s no one working it.</p><hr><p><strong>Reines:</strong> Hmm. Maybe this is another odd simulator setting? Then again, it really seems as though someone was cooking here just a few minutes ago.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> Maybe they&#39;re doing their best Mary Celeste crew impression?</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> Mmm, I&#39;ll have to really pour on the vinegar to tamp down the delicious smell this freshly fried fish is putting out.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;re already digging in!?</p><hr><p><strong>Reines:</strong> Hahaha, I&#39;m just showing the food its due respect. Mmm, yum! It&#39;s piping hot and perfectly flaky!</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> I can taste the delicious oils with every bite of fish! And these steaming hot chips are salted perfectly!</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> If this stand&#39;s proprietor were here, I&#39;d be breaking out my Reines Stamp of Approval.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> ...Hm?</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> What the...!?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> Now I see. Part of Trimmau got into the automated defense systems! And here I thought it was my comeuppance for dine and dashing!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Hold it, Reines.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Does that mean Trimmau has control over the simulator itself?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> How much of her do you have now?</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> Let me see... This just makes forty percent.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Forty percent, huh.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I guess that means the main unit is still somewhere else then?</p><hr><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> I knew there had to be more than an odd simulator setting behind the lack of people here.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> My Unreturning Formation isn&#39;t working right, either.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> You mean Zhuge Liang&#39;s famous maneuver?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Things might look normal here, but there&#39;s something going on right beneath the surface.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> It almost feels like a loading screen from a video game...</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> My tracking spell! There you are, Trimmau!</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> Huh? It can&#39;t be...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Reines! Fujimaru!!!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m back in my room?</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Does that mean the simulation is over!?</p><hr><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> No, it isn&#39;t. Take a closer look, Master.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> This is the old Chaldea. I&#39;m sure of it.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> No, that&#39;s not quite right either, Brother.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> Both my Mystic Eyes and the part of Trimmau I collected are reacting. We&#39;re definitely still in the simulator.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So, that means\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Then, this must be</p><hr><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> I see. So we&#39;re in a simulation of the old Chaldea!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Da Vinci, can you still hear us?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> I think we can take the silence as a no. Damn.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> Brother, you said that London reminded you of a loading screen, right?</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> What if that was a fake out, and Trimmau&#39;s real goal was to simulate the old Chaldea?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> ...If it is, that would explain why she infiltrated the automatic defense systems.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> I see. So she put up that London as a front while she was secretly building this simulation behind the scenes.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> But even if she is going haywire right now, I still don&#39;t understand why Trimmau would go to such lengths...</p><p><strong>P.A. System:</strong> Authenticating... Error... Reattempting authentication... Error...</p><p><strong>P.A. System:</strong> Authentication attempt limit reached. Locking system... Lockdown protocol halted by root user...</p><p><strong>P.A. System:</strong> Authenticating... Error... Reattempting authentication... Error...</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> What the hell?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> It looks like Trimmau&#39;s trying to hack into the system. But this... Wait. That&#39;s it.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Reines.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> Yes, Brother?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> You saw the last thing Trimmau turned into back in London, right?</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> ...Yeah, I did.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Do you know who it was?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Because if it was who I think it was, she&#39;s someone Fujimaru knows, too.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Someone I know?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> That&#39;s right. Someone with deep ties to the old Chaldea. Give it some thought, and I think you&#39;ll know who I mean.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You don&#39;t mean...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> So you figured it out, huh? Makes sense. I&#39;m sure you knew her a lot better than I did.</p><hr><p><strong>Reines:</strong> It was Chaldea&#39;s former director, Olga Marie Animusphere.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Looks like we managed to avoid any obstructions.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Are you two ready?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Olga Marie!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Director!</p><hr><p><strong>Reines:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> Hi, Trimmau. Sorry I took so long.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> The only reason Trimmau went haywire is because she&#39;s working properly.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> Huh? What do you mean?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Exactly what I said. Trimmau ended up like this because she was carrying out your orders.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You ordered her to do this, Professor?</p><hr><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> We had it backwards.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> You said you couldn&#39;t get into the central sector&#39;s data, right?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> In other words, Trimmau wasn&#39;t able to break through the new Chaldea&#39;s security.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> So in response, she made a place where she might be able to: the old Chaldea.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Instead of trying to get past the new security measures...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> ...she decided to use the simulator to create a route where she could get past the old ones.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> No way...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Is it even possible to bypass security that way?</p><hr><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> It depends, but it wouldn&#39;t be the first time this kind of scam has worked, either with magecraft or computers.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> I see. So if there&#39;s a flaw in the simulator&#39;s security, she might be able to use that to gain access.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Whether that&#39;s actually the case or not, it must be what Trimmau was thinking when she did all this.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Mystic Codes can think?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Can Mystic Codes really think like that?</p><hr><p><strong>Reines:</strong> Trimmau can. We had Flat help make her personality.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> Oh, Flat was one of Brother&#39;s pupils, by the way. The El-Melloi class was actually pretty popular, believe it or not.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Was that last part really necessary? Anyway, I can assure you that Trimmau&#39;s thought processes are impossibly flexible compared to those of standard AI.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Unfortunately, if she&#39;s going haywire now, that also means there&#39;s no telling what she might try next.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> We&#39;ll need to be very careful.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> Well? Come on, Trimmau, say something!</p><p><strong>Olga Marie?:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;re sure she&#39;s actually the Volumen Hydrargyrum, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You&#39;re sure that&#39;s not really Director Olga Marie, right?</p><hr><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Positive. I&#39;m also sure you know that just as well as I do.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> She&#39;s what Reines was hiding.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> There&#39;s something you&#39;re still not telling us, isn&#39;t there?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Yes, you were in an important position at the Clock Tower, and you do know a lot about high-level security.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> But that doesn&#39;t mean you can just breeze past Chaldea&#39;s security measures like they&#39;re nothing.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Which means there&#39;s something else you&#39;re keeping from us that allowed Trimmau to get through.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What&#39;s that?</p><hr><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> I&#39;ll tell you. Reines here didn&#39;t just know how Chaldea&#39;s security was set up.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> She also knew Olga Marie&#39;s habits from her own world. Didn&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> Haha, well this is embarrassing.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> There are a number of differences in this world, but in my world, yes, Olga Marie and I were very close.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Whoa! I had no idea!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You and Olga Marie, huh...</p><hr><p><strong>Reines:</strong> Well, relatively close. As mages, we both had our share of secrets, so we couldn&#39;t open up that much.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> But, we were still close enough to know each other&#39;s quirks...</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> ...and I could see them all over Chaldea&#39;s security.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> ...Man, this brings back memories.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> As the next Lords in waiting for our respective families, you and I used to deceive each other all the time.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> And as mages from the same generation, we also always had lots to talk about.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Reines, this Olga Marie isn&#39;t\u2013</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> I know, Brother. It&#39;s just a Volumen Hydrargyrum that looks like her.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> Besides, I never even knew this world&#39;s Olga Marie.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> I took a look at her file once, and she and my counterpart from this world&#39;s paths barely crossed at all.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> She never got on that train here, nor did she ever take part in the Grand Roll with me.</p><p><strong>P.A. System:</strong> Authenticating... Error... Reattempting authentication... Error...</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> That&#39;s why I can&#39;t fully get through this Chaldea&#39;s security. The Marie I knew might look like the one from this world, but she&#39;s a completely different person.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> That&#39;s why I\u2013</p><p><strong>Olga Marie?:</strong> Mage threat detected. Eliminating.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> Ghh!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Professor!</p><hr><p><strong>Reines:</strong> Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;m fine. As I was saying...</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> That&#39;s why I&#39;m going to tear you apart.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> Seven holes are bored into primordial chaos. There are poisonous women to great men. Never is there a time when neither sun nor moon is set.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> Behold my tactics! Unspoken Formation...release!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Release!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Trimmau&#39;s back to normal!</p><hr><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Now I see. Sima Yi&#39;s Noble Phantasm exposes an enemy&#39;s weakness, so Trimmau was imitating Olga Marie because she was Chaldea&#39;s weakness!</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> Not exactly. I only meant for Trimmau to imitate Olga Marie&#39;s habits.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> I never planned for her to imitate Olga Marie herself.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> When she tried, she got stuck at imitating the Olga Marie I know, and now, here we are, trying to clean up the mess.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> And damn if it isn&#39;t a hot one. I could cry.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> Now she&#39;s imitating me! Well Trim, if you think you can beat the real deal, you&#39;re sorely mistaken!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Reines.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> I&#39;m going to focus my skills entirely on you. You said this is your mess, right? Then clean it up yourself.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> ...(Sigh) I swear, you&#39;re too damn lenient with me for your own good sometimes, Brother.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> But I guess I can&#39;t blame you, seeing how adorable I am! Thanks, Brother! Just this once, I&#39;ll take you up on that!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Trimmau:</strong> ...Lady...Reines?</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> Welcome back, Trimmau.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Are you okay!?</p><hr><p><strong>Reines:</strong> I&#39;m fine. It&#39;s nothing.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> I just never expected to run into my Servant karma here of all places.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Servant karma?</p><hr><p><strong>Reines:</strong> Well, maybe it&#39;s not karma so much as a weakness that only Pseudo-Servants with their host&#39;s personality intact are susceptible to.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> You know how Servants don&#39;t retain memories of their past summonings, right?</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> Exceptions to the rule aside, usually it&#39;s the person summoning the Servant who feels bad about being forgotten.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> But for Pseudo-Servants, we&#39;re the ones who remember, and have to deal with being forgotten.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> Obviously, the chances of running into someone we know are practically nonexistent, since we&#39;re in a world entirely different from our own and all.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> So even if we do happen to run into someone we know, they end up being someone else entirely.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> So, yeah, it&#39;s painful. Nothing I can&#39;t handle, but it still hurts.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> ...But, maybe it&#39;s not all bad.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> Maybe this&#39;ll help me better understand what it&#39;s like to be in your shoes.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> As a Master, you go through this sort of thing all the time, right? So I should probably learn to appreciate this pain.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s not all pain.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I can at least tell you it&#39;s worth it.</p><hr><p><strong>Trimmau:</strong> Initiating reboot. Reboot complete.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> Whoa!</p><p><strong>Trimmau:</strong> I&#39;ve been monitoring the situation. I&#39;m so sorry, Lady Reines.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> Don&#39;t be. This was pretty much all my fault.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> I&#39;m sorry, Trimmau.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> At least it looks like the experiment worked. I can tell you and my Spirit Origin are working together better now.</p><p><strong>Trimmau:</strong> Yes, Lady Reines. I can confirm a thirty-seven percent increase in Spirit Origin output.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Looks like the simulation&#39;s fading away now that Trimmau&#39;s back to normal.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> Come on, you two. Let&#39;s get out of here.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> Phew. This latest caper really tuckered me out.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Then get some sleep.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> If Jason is anything to go by, even normal Servants can benefit from a good nap.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> As Pseudo-Servants, we no doubt need proper rest even more than they do.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> Hmm. You make a pretty convincing case.</p><p><strong>Reines:</strong> Okay then, good night, Brother.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Good night, Reines.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> Just a moment, El-Melloi II.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> ...Lord Sima Yi.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ASima Yi:</strong> Worry not. Lady Reines is fast asleep now, so we can speak freely.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ASima Yi:</strong> There&#39;s something I wished to discuss with you, something that&#39;s been nagging at me. In fact, it&#39;s something I noticed you purposely shied away from.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> What are you talking about?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ASima Yi:</strong> The reason Trimmau went haywire in the first place.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ASima Yi:</strong> She was making predictive calculations at a level she could not even properly verbalize, correct?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Because we need to know more about the data Chaldea possesses?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ASima Yi:</strong> Exactly. The Volumen Hydrargyrum calculated that data was a top priority, even if it meant she had to go haywire to process it.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ASima Yi:</strong> Of course, her efforts to do so ultimately proved to be for naught. Haha, I must say, this modern world has turned out to be much more enjoyable than I expected.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ASima Yi:</strong> Oh, and one more thing. You should come out of hiding once in a while, you cowardly excuse for a tactician.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ASima Yi:</strong> Your \u201Cgift\u201D of women&#39;s clothing sent to taunt me is the whole reason I ended up inhabiting a woman&#39;s body, after all.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Tell it to someone who cares. Besides, I&#39;m enjoying this modern world plenty myself.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Did you just get Liang to rehash the time he sent you women&#39;s clothing to insult you as being weak for refusing to fight him?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ASima Yi:</strong> I sure did. It only makes sense he would respond to me, no matter how deeply he may be lying dormant.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ASima Yi:</strong> Such is the nature of our relationship.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ASima Yi:</strong> Of course, I have my doubts as to whether he truly thought women were synonymous with weakness or not.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ASima Yi:</strong> At any rate, take care, Zhuge Liang. I am sure we will see each other again someday.</p>',380),i=[r];function a(g,l){return t(),o("div",null,i)}var p=e(n,[["render",a],["__file","Sima Yi - Reines.html.vue"]]);export{p as default};
