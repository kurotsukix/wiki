It&#39;s just not possible, but...this is without a doubt \u201Cme.\u201D</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...Wait, no. This is \u201Cme,\u201D and yet it isn&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The skill is not all there, but the passion is. That passion is forcing \u201Cme\u201D to become more like \u201Cme.\u201D</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Actually, I&#39;m a little bit put off by this passion...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The passion on this canvas... It&#39;s like wearing layers of coats in the summer, with the heat on full blast, and eating hot udon all at the same time.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> How do I know!? That&#39;s because I&#39;m always a perver... I mean, passionate!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Anyway, back on topic.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Curse you! Who would do something so blasphemous!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I can&#39;t just sit around like this. At this rate, Romani will lecture me... I mean...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> This is a problem that could cause the Foundation of Humanity to collapse, thus creating a new Singularity!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Okay! Activating emergency alarm system! Everyone, assemble!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> ...Trace ...On.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I see... So this is how you create your twin blades.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I was wondering how you get them back so fast every time they shatter.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fou. Fou, fou.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Yes. However, it&#39;s more accurate to say that I create a copy that&#39;s not better or worse than the original.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> No matter how similar it is to the real thing, it&#39;s never as strong. I guess fiction is too light to support the weight of reality.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Although my projections must be similar to the originals. However, even if I create an identical copy, it&#39;s no more than reflections on the surface of water.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> They&#39;re nothing more than counterfeits, different from the originals.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Different in what way?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> It would take a while to explain everything, so let me skip that for now.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> However, that doesn&#39;t mean the counterfeits will always perform worse than the originals, if we&#39;re just talking numbers.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> If both of them perform equally well, it&#39;s not the \u201Cobjects\u201D themselves that decide which is better, but the \u201Caudience.\u201D</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> It&#39;s not really a nice topic for the people who made the originals...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> However, humans are a species that constantly aims for the future. The concept of improvement is necessary to move forward.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Originals made from scratch are valuable, yes, but so are the imitations derived from them.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> My projections are just copies, but the imitations in this world are originals that have been developed further.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> What starts from one expands out into infinite possibilities and shapes the future.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I see. That&#39;s very deep.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Anyway, let&#39;s get back to cleaning the rooms. Master, are you keeping your room clean?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I always keep it clean.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Excellent. One&#39;s room is the reflection of their mind.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> The fact that you keep your room tidy reflects your personality.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Sometimes it gets messy.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Oh, you mean at Halloween and Christmas? Remember, one&#39;s room is the reflection of their mind.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> In other words, you are the type that gets excited whenever there&#39;s an event.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Hehehe, he&#39;s right on the spot, huh? Senpai.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Hmm?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The emergency alarm... Something is happening, Senpai!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Doctor, is there an emergency?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Sorry I&#39;m late! What was that emergency alarm just now?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You just got here? Wait, aren&#39;t you the one who sounded the alarm?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;d feel better if that was me, but it wasn&#39;t. Normally I&#39;d be tuning Chaldea&#39;s reactor at this hour.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Then, who could it be?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Ahem. Testing, testing! Testing, testing! As this is an emergency situation, I have taken over the intercom.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Attention all Servants who can stand by and accept our Master&#39;s recklessness with a smile.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Empty your minds and come to my workshop immediately!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Of course, you are to bring your weapons. Oh, Romani is annoying so he can&#39;t come.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You have one minute! Now hop to it!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Hey, what happened?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...It seems to be something she can&#39;t say for now. Anyway, let&#39;s head over there.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Oh, there you are! As expected, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I knew you&#39;d come, too, Mash! Hmm, and it looks like you&#39;ve also brought... Huh, only Emiya?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I thought surely seven nosy Servants would be lured here...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> I think once they found out the alarm was from the Da Vinci Workshop, none of them wanted to come anymore.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> I on the other hand was already talking to Fujimaru, so I simply tagged along.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Whaaaaat? Am I really that unpopular?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Of course. Maybe you should change that attitude of yours. I heard even Dr. Tesla can understand other people&#39;s feelings more.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Ugh. Romani. Why did you come? I told you not to!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> If you tell someone not to come, of course their curiosity will get the better of them!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> What did you do this time? I may be a coward, but even I get mad sometimes.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You misunderstand. This time it&#39;s not just my problem, but the entirety of Chaldea&#39;s problem.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> This time?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Excuse me. This time, and every time. I am your technical advisor, after all.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Sounds like trouble.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That&#39;s right. We&#39;re in such big trouble I feel like my rationality is gonna be gone like Astolfo.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Okay, there&#39;s no time. I will get to the point!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I have reached the truth of this world. At last, I have identified its lies!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Oh, hello? Medical team? Do you have a spare bed? We have a weirdo here who&#39;s gone insane.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> If you&#39;re not going to listen then leave!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Doctor, I know how you feel, but let&#39;s hear her out for now.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Regardless of his personality, he\u2013 I mean she is the universal genius, Leonardo da Vinci.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> There has to be some truth in her words, right?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Well, I suppose so, but... That&#39;s what makes it worse.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yes, as expected from the Hero of Wrought Iron. Nice save, Emiya!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Makers will never forget how to respect one another. Maybe Romani should show more respect for me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That would be an issue, Da Vinci. Now, what do you mean by the world&#39;s lies?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Right. First, take a look at this.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This is\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> The infamous Mona Lisa!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hahaha. I won&#39;t deny that. A lot of blood and money has been shed for this painting, hasn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> She has a smug look on her face for some reason, Senpai!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It&#39;s truly the center of deceit!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> How could you say that in front of the greatest painting in history? ...Well, I&#39;ll admit I made a ton of money copying and pasting the same painting.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> She&#39;s admitting it, Senpai!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hahaha. Well, anyway. This is indeed the Craft Essence, Mona Lisa.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> However, this one wasn&#39;t made by my workshop.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> ...I could tell. It&#39;s very well-done, but it&#39;s a counterfeit. It&#39;s very meticulous, but I can sense anger from it as well.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> It&#39;s a step below the one created by Ms. Da Vinci, which costs more than a thousand Mana Prisms, a VERY VALUABLE magical resource.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I sense sarcasm in your words, but that&#39;s right! This is a counterfeit!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> To think someone would... Copy! My! MONA LISA!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I don&#39;t mean copy-and-paste! Each was painted from scratch!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s amazing. I can&#39;t tell the difference at all.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> You can spot a poorly made counterfeit from the technique.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> If it&#39;s a well-made counterfeit, you can naturally tell the difference from the aura it gives off.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> All creative works, not just swords, contain the ideals, emotions, and likes and dislikes of the one who made them.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> If one is desperate... No, if one puts their life on the line to feel the same way the original creator did, then it would be hard to tell the difference.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> This Mona Lisa...is incredible in its intensity and passion. Unfortunately, what it&#39;s lacking in is technique.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> It&#39;s a rare counterfeit that seeks to make up for its lack of skill with passion. Usually it&#39;s the other way around.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Indeed. By the way, is your class Artist?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> It&#39;s Archer. So, what&#39;s wrong with this counterfeit?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> There&#39;s nothing wrong with having a passionate follower, right? Isn&#39;t that what all creators want?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Actually... Mona Lisa hasn&#39;t been selling well lately.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Have they ever?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What? They did at one point?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> THEY DO SELL! They&#39;re the biggest hit from my workshop!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But all of a sudden they stopped selling! I thought it was strange and went to look, and found this!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> At first glance, they look the same and kinda have similar effects, but the price is only a tenth of the original!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I&#39;m sure you understand what I&#39;m trying to say now, right!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> No one is buying Mona Lisa from Da Vinci?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I didn&#39;t want to hear it... But you&#39;re right!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You&#39;re useless now?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The truth is so cruel... But that&#39;s what will happen at this rate!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Right, right. So basically an underworld broker is selling better Craft Essences for cheaper than Da Vinci&#39;s workshop.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> What&#39;s wrong with that? You&#39;re supposed to be in charge of Sheba and the summoning system anyway.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> No one likes this workshop anyway, so maybe you can just let the fake\u2014</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I will straight-up murder you, Romani.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Oh, right! Sorry!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Ahem. Oopsies! My real personality came out\u2606 Back to what we were saying\u2014</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Listen. Whoever&#39;s making this counterfeit is undeniably evil!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> (...I don&#39;t know. It feels twisted, but the passion within it is pure...)</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> And so, Fujimaru, I want you to find out who&#39;s making these...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...and defeat them, no questions asked!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Finding and arresting an underworld broker? That doesn&#39;t sound like Senpai&#39;s job...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> No, it most certainly is Fujimaru&#39;s job. I mean, whoever is doing it can only be evil.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> They must be the kind of demon that&#39;s filled with enough maliciousness to destroy this world.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> They&#39;re probably the strongest enemy you&#39;ve ever faced, but don&#39;t worry! This time... I&#39;ll be going with you!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Gwah!? No, no! What are you saying, Leonardo?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Chaldea needs you! If you&#39;re defeated, our effectiveness will drop by half!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> As the person in charge here, I can&#39;t allow that! You can&#39;t leave over something that doesn&#39;t matter...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hmm? It doesn&#39;t matter, you say?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> \u2014R-Right. Art is at the core of your soul, huh? I&#39;ll get the Rayshift ready.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Weak...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s Da Vinci for you...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Doctor...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...Well, I can&#39;t think of a way to stop Leonardo if she&#39;s already this angry...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> And to tell the truth, we can&#39;t ignore the question of where these counterfeits are coming from.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Oh, right. I had a pressure cooker running in my room. The beef for my stew should be done now.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hey! Emiya!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Tch! I was too late!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ah! Emiya-senpai, you were trying to run, weren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> No... I wasn&#39;t... Fine, I was.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> It&#39;s just that I&#39;m busy. I have to tune my weapons, clean my room, chat with the operator girl...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> As you can see, a Servant has many duties.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Good point, but I&#39;ve already finished cleaning all the rooms.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> W-Well... You see... These kind of events aren&#39;t really my forte...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Let&#39;s go, Master, Emiya-senpai! Let&#39;s go on a journey to find the counterfeits!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The more, the merrier! Right now the more sensible Servants around the better.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I haven&#39;t had this bad a feeling since that space rocket! For Senpai&#39;s sake too! Please!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> So you&#39;re asking not for your own sake, but your Master&#39;s... In that case...Hmmm...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Mash is really growing up...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Thanks, Mash. You&#39;re so dependable.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Well done, Mash. We can all suffer together.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Of course. All I can do right now is keep you safe!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> ...Humph. Very well. I give up. I&#39;ll go with you.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> So? Where are we going first? You must have some idea, Ms. Da Vinci.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Of course. Just leave that to me! Okay, Roman, I&#39;m going to borrow the Rayshift for a bit.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Don&#39;t worry. With Fujimaru&#39;s help we can solve this is no time!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Off to the Rayshift we go! Wow, my first Rayshift! I&#39;m so nervous!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Now, after tracing and observing the Spiritron information on the counterfeits, I&#39;ve concluded they came from these coordinates in this era.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hmmm, it&#39;s been so long since I stepped outside of Chaldea. The feeling of dirt, the breeze on my cheeks...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It&#39;s good to be alive, isn&#39;t it, Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Come, come, let&#39;s go find that jerk who&#39;s making all the counterfeits!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Da Vinci&#39;s really excited!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> She&#39;s been cooped up in her workshop until now. She&#39;s probably both an indoor and outdoor person.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Let&#39;s start by heading for the town. The first thing we need is information.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> There doesn&#39;t seem to be anything wrong with the town. It&#39;s very peaceful and pleasant.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Yes. Let&#39;s start with something basic. We&#39;ll show the counterfeit to someone passing by.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, I understand.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Excuse me!</p><p><strong>Both:</strong> What is it?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Get &#39;em\u2014!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Roger!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> That escalated quickly! Let&#39;s finish this and go home!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> What is this sudden attempt at arrest?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Every fight has its reasons. Even if we are in the wrong, shouldn&#39;t you tell us why!?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Some truths can only be found through dialogue! Let&#39;s talk about this! That&#39;s how I win!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> I already know that talking with you is a trap that we can&#39;t fall into!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> What... Have we done business together once before!?</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> So it seems... How sad... Trust is such a fragile thing...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Quite the contrary!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s right, Master!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Hmm... If conversation is impossible, I suppose I&#39;ll act like a politician, and settle things by force.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Because I&#39;d like to get rid of the negative image that \u201Cif anything bad happens, it&#39;s probably Caesar!\u201D</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> I agree, Caesar. I, P, know exactly how you feel.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> I&#39;m opposed to violence, but I will join in the fight. Don&#39;t worry. It&#39;s possible to brainwash them mid-battle.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> I want to say this loud and clear! We are innocent\u2013!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hey, making someone laugh before battle is not right! I almost dropped my staff!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> How can you honestly claim that you&#39;re innocent?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;re one to talk, Da Vinci!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You&#39;re not exactly innocent either!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Both:</strong> We swear we&#39;re innocent!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Caesar, is that true?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> It&#39;s true!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Selling those counterfeits for cheap wouldn&#39;t bring in any money anyway.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> First I&#39;d tell the customer that I&#39;m offering the real Mona Lisas! Then I&#39;d buy up all of the Craft Essences from Da Vinci.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Why? Because as long as I&#39;ve got the real ones with me, the customers would be willing to pay full price...</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> without having to worry about them being fakes! To just distribute the counterfeits for free like that\u2014</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> I swear to you on my very soul. I would never do something so wasteful!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This Caesar is also the real thing!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Indeed. He knows that trust is the strongest foundation for a business.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> P, are you trying to do what you think&#39;s best, again?</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> Even if I did make Mona Lisa counterfeits... I don&#39;t think that would have any good effect on the world.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> The Mona Lisa is the pinnacle of art. Not many paintings share that same level of fame.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> Degrading it to the level of counterfeits is unthinkable even in the world of magecraft.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> ...However, if something can be created by sacrificing the original, I guess that would be all right...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It wouldn&#39;t be all right! My heart would sustain heavy damage!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But... I guess the two of them aren&#39;t behind the counterfeits.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m sorry...we got ahead of ourselves.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Humph. Don&#39;t be sad, oh girl who is plump and firm in a different way than me.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> After all, we secretly Rayshifted here because we heard about the rumors of the counterfeits.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> I thought I could use Paracelsus as a decoy and brought him here... Hahaha, I didn&#39;t expect to get caught before we split up.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> It&#39;s embarrassing, but I thought the same thing.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> I was going to stand behind Caesar and use Sword P to get rid of both him and the counterfeiter.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> I think that mage over there needs to reconsider what \u201Cembarrassing\u201D means... Anyway...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> For now, we&#39;re the ones asking questions. I would have you tell us everything you know about the counterfeits.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> We&#39;re sure there&#39;s a group of counterfeiters in this town. My \u201Cmoney sensor\u201D tells me so.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> But there&#39;s one problem. I&#39;m told a Servant is running the counterfeiter&#39;s workshop.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...What!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> A-A Servant! ...I see. That explains it.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But who could it be? Michelangelo? Raphael? Or perhaps... Donatello?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> There&#39;s so many... Him? Her? Who?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> I can guess what kind of relationships Leonardo da Vinci had in life.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> I don&#39;t know who it is myself. Their workshop is here. Go pay them a visit.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Okay, thanks! Off to the counterfeiter&#39;s workshop, everyone!</p><h2 id="section-1-counterfeit-the-innocent-boy" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-counterfeit-the-innocent-boy" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 1: Counterfeit &quot;The Innocent Boy&quot;</h2><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> We&#39;re almost there. I&#39;m picking up multiple enemy signals.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Be careful!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yuck. It looks just like my workshop!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> And it&#39;s not just the Mona Lisa...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You&#39;re right! The Annunciation, the Vitruvian Man... Even the Last Supper!?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> They&#39;re better preserved than the ones that exist now in 2018.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hmm? What&#39;s this...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Is that your manuscript?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Let me see... Yes, this one&#39;s mine. However, this one&#39;s a counterfeit.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This one is the real one, and that one over there is a fake... Master, I can&#39;t tell the difference at all...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Me neither.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Right? I doubt even the counterfeiter would be able to tell either.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I can kind of tell.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Wow, Master... You&#39;ve got the sharpest eye in Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> The manuscripts of Leonardo da Vinci stretch for thousands of pages, and that&#39;s just what exists now.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> It also uses mirror writing, which means making a counterfeit must&#39;ve required a ton of effort.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> I can understand the reason behind the Mona Lisa and the other paintings, but why the manuscripts?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Okay, let&#39;s take them all with us!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh? All of them?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> One or two wouldn&#39;t be a problem, but to take all of these back with us...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What a pain!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> If you take them back for me, I&#39;ll trade them for items in my workshop.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Let&#39;s get to it!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Get them loaded up!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> You guys change your mind fast, huh?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Sorry to interrupt you when you&#39;re working, but I&#39;m seeing enemies! Be careful!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Enemy signals detected! They seem...different than normal enemies!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Don&#39;t worry. In terms of strength, they&#39;re no different than regular enemies.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> \u2013Let&#39;s do it!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Now I&#39;m seeing a Servant! It&#39;s close!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Thanks, Doctor!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...Hmm? No, what is this?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It&#39;s a Servant... But it looks a little crude. Like parts of it are patched together.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Crude?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> A Shadow Servant is literally a fake\u2014a shadow modeled after a Heroic Spirit&#39;s Spirit Origin.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> This is just \u201Csomething very similar.\u201D It&#39;s a well-made Spirit Origin down to the details, but...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Should we call it a counterfeit?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Yes. That&#39;s exactly right.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> ...That explains it. No wonder something didn&#39;t feel right.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> In other words, you&#39;re not exactly a pure Servant.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Alexander the Great...</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Yes, that&#39;s right!</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> We are counterfeit Heroic Spirits. We&#39;re Servants, yet we are neither pure Servants nor pure heroes.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Go easy on me, okay\u2661</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So beautiful... His smile is so beautiful!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> The spitting image of an enchanting young boy. Any opinions as an artist?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> \u2013I&#39;m in love. I&#39;d like to draw his naked body. No, I want to get naked and draw him!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> ...I see. Do it in a dimensional rift so you don&#39;t bother anyone.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Okay, Alexander. Tell us who made you and what your goal is.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> I won&#39;t hurt you. I may not look it, but I&#39;m a man who understands counterfeits.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> You&#39;re lying, mister! You&#39;re going to hurt me, I know it!</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Once you get the information you&#39;ll kill me in a heartbeat, won&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> What kind of barbarian do you think I am? I&#39;ll capture you, but after that, it&#39;s up to you.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> For one thing, your body is... No, I won&#39;t say it. I&#39;m sure you&#39;re well aware.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Yup. No need to bring that up. I don&#39;t worry about that kind of stuff at all.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> What&#39;s required from me now is innocence and purity. That&#39;s what will bring her peace.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> On the other hand, that also means all she wanted was my abilities, without any unnecessary elements.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> But I guess that&#39;s fun in its own way.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> \u201CShe\u201D? Who can that be...</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Too bad! That&#39;s a secret!</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> I mean, right now I am \u201Ca talented little stepbrother who adores the big sister living with him!\u201D</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Huh? I&#39;m sorry, what?</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Heheh! It&#39;s so romantic, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> To be honest, I didn&#39;t quite get that backstory either, but it&#39;s a very girly wish!</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Come on, [\u2642 mister /\u2640 lady]\u2661 It&#39;s time for war!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> That intensity. Those words. Even if you are a counterfeit, you are the man who&#39;ll someday become the King of Conquerors.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Very well. Let&#39;s fight him, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Roger!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Hmm... I guess that&#39;s it, then. Hahaha! I figured it would be hard to actually win.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> To get so close and still be so far... That&#39;s what is sad about being a fake, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> That&#39;s not true. It was a fight between Servants, and you lost. That&#39;s all.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> \u2014As expected. Real Heroic Spirits are always so amazing, huh?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> \u2014</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Oh, how I enjoyed that... A young man, his trained biceps pushed to the limit... Wonderful!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Da Vinci&#39;s being weird...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Look. She may be real, but look at her. It&#39;s fine to worry about where you came from, but stupid to compare it.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Whatever. Thanks for the nice speech. In exchange, I&#39;ll tell you what you want to know, I guess.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> But all I can really tell you is your next destination.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> There are counterfeit workshops all over the place. They&#39;re spreading fakes of Da Vinci&#39;s works little by little.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> But I don&#39;t know what her goal is, not in the slightest!</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Why? Because my job&#39;s to be innocent! I haven&#39;t been told anything about what goes on behind the scenes.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> I mean, it&#39;s not that hard to figure out. But it would be rude to tell.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Roger. I see you&#39;re not going to talk no matter what.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> We&#39;re in a hurry...but do you need me to finish you off?</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Hmm, nope, I guess. I hate sympathy.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> I don&#39;t... Neither does she. I&#39;m a fake, so I&#39;ll just disappear when my expiration date arrives.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Master, um...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Sadder than you thought?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um, yes! I really don&#39;t know what to feel!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Is this supposed to be serious?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> A bit, yeah. A king once said...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> \u201CDon&#39;t give objects hearts.\u201D Perhaps that was his way of being kind.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Okay, all done! Pretty boys are the best!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Like a fairy that&#39;s all exterior and no interior, elegantly flitting about the world!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Oh, how I hope that it can express even half of his beauty!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I don&#39;t think Da Vinci is going to be able to help us with much, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Emiyan is our only help!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Leave it to me!

Is everyone ready?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> ...Let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hey Roman. Analyze this homunculus for me, would you?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> You always make me do everything, don&#39;t you... Fine, I&#39;ll do it.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...I see. This one&#39;s different, too. It&#39;s similar to a homunculus, but different.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Another counterfeit, huh... All right, let&#39;s get moving.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Now that we&#39;ve confirmed this homunculus is a counterfeit, we know we&#39;re heading in the right direction.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> Oh, there you are! Hey, original Heroic Spirits!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Does that mean you&#39;re another counterfeit?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You too, Hektor\u2013</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> Well, Servants are basically counterfeits to begin with. So it would make me happy if you would just let me go.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> That&#39;s not possible. You&#39;re still spreading the counterfeits.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> Are heroes of justice always this stubborn?</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> How about it, Master? I think you&#39;re likely to be a bit more flexible.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Tell me what your goal is.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> My goal? My goal, huh... Well, if I really have to say, it&#39;s to pat her head.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I don&#39;t understand what you&#39;re talking about!</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> My job is to spoil her. The role of Hektor is\u2013</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> \u201CA friendly, free-spirited older man who&#39;s back from overseas, who may or may not be related by blood!\u201D</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Too long!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> W-Wow. Wait, where&#39;s the \u201Coverseas\u201D part coming from?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Stop it. Delving into vague backstories is a good way to get burned.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> Basically, she wants someone who cares. Someone gentle and sweet, who does whatever she says.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> First Alexander, now this... Seems their Master must be a bit of a spoiled child.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> A spoiled child, huh? But isn&#39;t that kind of what makes her adorable?</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> When a spoiled child is demanding, it means they&#39;re testing your trust. And they&#39;re doing that because they&#39;re scared.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> Isn&#39;t that kind of cute?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hmm. So a dandy-type Heroic Spirit who spoils you, huh... It works!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It does not.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> No.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That aside, these particular counterfeits are unforgivable!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Look at these Mona Lisas here that just got finished!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> What I hate isn&#39;t the skill, it&#39;s the passion!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Skill-wise, it&#39;s still just an inferior copy, but the passion is real. But she&#39;s not trying to imitate me!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Instead of putting in the passion to imitate me, she&#39;s starting to put it towards surpassing me!</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> Oh, so you noticed, huh?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Her skills are a little inferior, but when mixed with her passion, they make it seem like the real thing.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> It&#39;s the type of counterfeits that you can&#39;t just ignore. \u2013I assume you&#39;re ready, Hektor?</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> Right, right. I figured this was coming. Well, that&#39;s fine.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> I may be a counterfeit, but I&#39;ll give it my all!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> Tch... Fine, I lost. I guess this is as far as a counterfeit can go.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> No, Hektor. You didn&#39;t lose because you&#39;re a counterfeit.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You lost because you&#39;re weak.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> Wow, aren&#39;t you harsh!? But well, that makes me feel better.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> All right, next time I challenge you I&#39;ll be stronger. See ya!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> ...Heh. He may joke around, but his spear was sharp and struck hard. Carelessness could have meant our end.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> The way he talks is an important part of his defenses. That&#39;s why the great hero Achilles kept his distance.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> A passionate counterfeit... One that seeks to surpass the original...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Well, that&#39;s what happens if you do it for a while. Most counterfeiters eventually end up like that.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> They stop making copies, and even trying to become like the original.

NO WAY!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Foooou!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Fujimaru and Fou are freaking out!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I-I&#39;m surprised too!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> What&#39;s wrong, Siegfried! This isn&#39;t like you at all!</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> I can&#39;t help it. I&#39;m a counterfeit after all. If the original is humble, I must surpass it with my pride to defeat my opponents.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> For one thing, isn&#39;t it rude to tell someone you&#39;re sorry when you&#39;re not?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> He&#39;s right. A very arrogant comment, but he&#39;s right!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> He&#39;s a counterfeit trying to surpass the original, but he&#39;s still kind of humble at his core!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I think that&#39;s just who Siegfried is!</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> \u2014I am the strongest dragon, descending on a beach beneath the crescent moon. I have nothing to apologize for.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Instead, be bold. Be bolder\u2014 That&#39;s what she whispers to me.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> She, huh? Hmm, and it&#39;s not like she has something against me, right?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Or actually, I don&#39;t think she does. If she hated me, she&#39;d be a little more clingy, or sticky\u2013</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yes. It&#39;s best to say that she&#39;s dry.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> A dried-up fresco. It lasts for a century, but will never change.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> ...That&#39;s why you&#39;re the most famous artist in the world. You&#39;re very perceptive. I commend you for that.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> But that doesn&#39;t mean I can tell you anything. I&#39;m sor... No, you&#39;re my enemy, so I&#39;m not sorry at all.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Kindness towards an enemy can only be shown if you have the strength to spare it, and I do not.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Now let&#39;s fight, Fujimaru!

I know who they are.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> One is Arash, a great hero of ancient Persia.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> The other is the gifted hero Arjuna, a legend in India&#39;s epic poem the Mahabharata.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Even if they&#39;re counterfeit Heroic Spirits, they are far more powerful than us.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Arash and Arjuna. Both were Heroic Spirits who lived during the Age of the Gods.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> They&#39;re going to attack. Don&#39;t hesitate, Master.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> \u2013Even after sacrificing Siegfried, we dealt them almost no damage.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> Nameless Hero. I do not know who you are, but I respect your ability.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Your strategic error was to try to kill us without using your Noble Phantasms.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Of course\u2013Arjuna aside, it&#39;s not like Arash can use his Noble Phantasm here.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong> Hmm, this is quite vexing.

In that case... You there, that Master! Won&#39;t you make a deal with me?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> It&#39;s clear that we&#39;re stronger.

I can create new works of art.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I want to see Da Vinci&#39;s real works.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> ...You heard that, Da Vinci. Our Master can be quite reckless.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s just how Senpai is!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Either way, I&#39;m not that weak to a point of asking my enemies for mercy. Arash, Arjuna... Ready your bows.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong> Hah hah hah! Your Master is quite bold. I wish we could provide you with some of our Master&#39;s sensitivity.</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong> \u2013But...a battle is a battle. We won&#39;t hold back.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> So you don&#39;t need mercy from us, huh? Such an endearing fool, but\u2013you&#39;ve made a grave mistake.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> My name is Arjuna. With this arrow, you will all scatter like a flower&#39;s petals!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Arash:</strong> Ah dammit. I lost... I didn&#39;t think I pulled any punches but...</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> So a counterfeit&#39;s utmost effort wasn&#39;t enough to defeat an original, huh... No...authenticity isn&#39;t the problem here.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> We lost to you. And that is all...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I suppose we don&#39;t have to run around the world anymore. She&#39;s at an art museum, right?</p><p><strong>Arash:</strong> Oh, I&#39;m not about to confess to that!</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> Arash is right. You should find that out yourself.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> Leonardo da Vinci. History&#39;s greatest artist, known worldwide for your works.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> ...Right. I don&#39;t want you to meet her. However, if you do happen to run into her...</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> Witness the truth with your own eyes.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> We&#39;ve come this far. All that&#39;s left is to go meet the boss\u2013</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Will you come with me?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Of course!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I see. One more thing.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...Thanks...for what you did earlier. Hah, it&#39;s kind of awkward to directly thank someone.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m seeing this... Da Vinci...seems...to be...embarrassed!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Doctor, do not ruin a nice moment. Please shut up.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou fou.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Anyway, you agreed. You&#39;ll see this through with me to the end, right?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...It seems my role this time is to ascertain the authenticity of her works.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> By the way, Da Vinci. You mentioned an \u201Cart museum.\u201D Which one, exactly?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Oh, come on. Surely you know where my Mona Lisa was originally on display, right?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> The Louvre!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> If she&#39;s not there... Then I&#39;ll give up without complaint!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But for now, let&#39;s search thoroughly...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!</p><h2 id="section-5-counterfeit-the-father-troubled-over-his-rebellious-daughter" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-5-counterfeit-the-father-troubled-over-his-rebellious-daughter" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 5: Counterfeit &quot;The Father Troubled Over His Rebellious Daughter&quot;</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So this is the Louvre...

How laid-back, Master. ...Well, don&#39;t worry about it.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> If you have the time, it&#39;d be good for you to enjoy the art here.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> However, nothing on display here is authentic. Although you should still be able to enjoy them since they&#39;re well-made duplicates.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It&#39;s a date, of course!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> D... Da...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Umm, I do not know if I will meet your standards, but I shall do my best for the occasion!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Well then... Roman, are there any Servants?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Scan complete. The counterfeits are definitely there.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> If you continue going straight, be careful. You&#39;ll probably encounter enemies.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Okay. Let&#39;s get started, shall we?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes! Master, your orders please!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...A counterfeit Heroic Spirit is coming!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Ugh... This malicious aura...</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> \u2013Oh, now that&#39;s a familiar face.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Gilles de Rais!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yes, I&#39;m not surprised... As long as she&#39;s there, he&#39;ll be with her.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> What are you babbling about! My name is Gilles de Rais!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> I am \u201Ca sad father who was loved by his daughter when she was a kid, but is now hated by her since she became a rebellious teenager!\u201D</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> I am Gilles de Rais, who gets shooed away with comments like \u201CDad, you smell like an old person!\u201D</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> How tragic...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Oh... Yeah, I know where she&#39;s coming from though.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Thank you for your vivid description! I deeply sympathize!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> Thank you, sweet young lady! Oh, if only my daughter had your kindness!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> But so it goes. This is also fate... If this is the stage that child envisioned, I must resign myself to that fact.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> ...I don&#39;t think she had any intention of sharing that information with others...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Enough. Gilles de Rais, we have nothing to ask of you.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> If you stand in our way, we will cut you down.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> Oh, is that right? Hooooooowever!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> Finally, I have a question for you, Master. Why do you interfere with us!?</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> If Leonardo da Vinci&#39;s counterfeits are a problem, we&#39;ll persuade that child to forge someone else&#39;s works.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> I beg you! Please don&#39;t interfere with us!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> We have to meet her.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Right. Marshal Gilles de Rais.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> We know her identity. We simply want to understand her motive.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Well, it&#39;s possible that we already have a rough idea, but...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> To go into bouts of fury, despair, and contempt by merely imagining others&#39; motives...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I can&#39;t give my approval.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Agreed. In any case, we cannot avoid a fight.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Whatever her purpose is, it doesn&#39;t change the fact that she opposes us.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> No matter how touching her wish is, we must first defeat her if we are to reason with her.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> ...I see. In that case, we shall be your opponents. For that child&#39;s dreams and wishes.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> We seven Servants were created to fulfill them after all.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> Let the counterfeits surpass their originals! Let falsity overpower truth!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> Even if we&#39;re branded as spurious, false, or specious, we still exist now, in this place!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> Heh... Sorry, but she&#39;s all right.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> She is not a lonely girl who had faith foisted on her and was forced into seclusion.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> She is not a warrior who continues forward, even while bearing wounds that won&#39;t heal. She is not a moralizing saint.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> No miracle will happen, no revelation.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> Even though she was just a counterfeit... She&#39;s trying to spread her wings out in the world as an individual!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> I dream of the eventual day when we shall meet again somewhere far away. Farewell...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> ...Then all that&#39;s left are her and one more.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We know who she is. It&#39;s the other one that&#39;s the problem.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> If I had to guess, I would say someone like Karna.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Kojirou Sasaki is also a possibility.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Wh-What about Leonidas?

I accept her love with all of my body.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> What is wrong with that?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> ...You heard her. So was your kick an expression of love?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Of course not! Not even close! Dammit, why is this happening to me!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> All I did was make a simple wish: \u201CAmong my seven followers, it would be nice to have a woman.\u201D</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> How did that get twisted into me getting a woman straight out of horror movies calling me \u201CBig Sister\u201D instead of Master!?</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> Love... It&#39;s love... Everything is love... Hahhhh...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> I told you! I AM NOT! LOOKING! FOR THAT KIND OF LOVE!</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> Ahhh, this pain...this impact... It sends a tingling sensation down my spine! I see, love can be painful!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Well, that has some truth in it.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> \u2013Sigh... Fine, please ignore this for now.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> Hahh... Hahh... Hahh...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I will do that...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Hmph. I figured you would sniff me out.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> But you came faster than I expected. As always, that nose of yours works like a dog, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We haven&#39;t seen you since Orleans, eh, Jeanne Alter?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> ...I thought you were gone for good.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> \u2013Ha!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> It doesn&#39;t matter how twisted my birth was. Once I exist as a concept, it&#39;s impossible to get rid of me.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> ...True.

There was almost zero possibility that you could be summoned again.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Ahahahaha! Yes, you&#39;re right, you&#39;re absolutely right! The possibility of me being summoned again was infinitesimal.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> After all, nobody wanted me! The one hero who wished for me was dead!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Except for him, I ruled by brute force, so no one wanted me brought back!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> \u2013So I inverted the idea.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> The one woman who would never wish for me, the other half of me whom I hate and despise...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> I managed to flip that idiot&#39;s wish inside-out, and somehow that&#39;s how I was reborn.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> So forceful... It&#39;s like a fictional villain materializing into reality.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> It&#39;s a rule-breaking technique made possible by the fact that the Heroic Spirit Jeanne d&#39;Arc is unbelievably popular.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...Yes, I accept that. I am without a doubt a counterfeit. An abysmal possibility born out of her mercy.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> But this world is full of lies. The world approves of the existence of counterfeits. No one says \u201Ca counterfeit must not surpass the original!\u201D</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Alter... You&#39;re dissatisfied as a counterfeit, and want to surpass the original?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> That&#39;s right.

Want me to hide in the shadows? HAH! Like I would ever do that!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Even if I&#39;m a counterfeit, there are no rules saying I can&#39;t make a name for myself in this world!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> I am Jeanne d&#39;Arc.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Many people imagined that a death like mine warranted vengeance. I&#39;m a witch who fell on account of that.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> I am, beyond a shred of doubt, one aspect of Jeanne d&#39;Arc!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> I am an Anti-Hero born from the dark abyss of murderous intent and hatred... An Avenger-class Servant!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> ...Avenger, you say?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> She&#39;s right. She doesn&#39;t fit into any of the seven classes... She&#39;s also different than Jeanne&#39;s Ruler class!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...Get up now, you pervert!</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> Yes! Hahh, hahh, hahh... I&#39;ve had my fill...</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> And now, I am going to kill you. Prepare yourselves.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> This spear will not overlook the fact that you&#39;re Big Sister&#39;s enemy... Oh, it&#39;s also good for giving her acupuncture.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> I&#39;ll never let you give me a massage again! Look! Look what you did to me!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> That&#39;s... Hm. I was going to keep my mouth shut, but let me correct you.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Listen, Holy Maiden of Vengeance.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Wh-What do you want? Talking like that, you must be a womanizer.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Hahaha. All right, now I won&#39;t hold anything back.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> You summoned seven counterfeit Heroic Spirits. No, you made them.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> That was revenge for Orleans, yes? But this time, your wishes are mixed in there.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Why are most of the counterfeit Heroic Spirits handsome men? Why didn&#39;t you rely on your general, Gilles?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> The answer is clear. You just haven&#39;t realized it yourself. Deep inside that consciousness is a desire to be the protagonist!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Nonsense! If that&#39;s the case, how do you explain this perverted woman!?</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> What... Perverted? What a passionate comment... (Blush)</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Die of dehydration!</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> Aaah! Love is painfully hot!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um... Even I understand.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m sure you just wanted \u201Can honest friend who&#39;s the same sex as you\u201D right?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> \u2014!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...Annoying. You people are truly annoying.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> I am a lone Avenger. The counterfeits are only pawns. If I don&#39;t like them, I will crush them without a second thought.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Come at me. I will show you even a counterfeit can surpass the original!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Here she comes. Your orders, please, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Somehow we managed to take down Brynhild, but...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Right. Jeanne Alter is still a threat!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> We just need one more push. You can do it, Master!</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> ...I failed. Master, sorry I couldn&#39;t be of use to you...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Don&#39;t worry about it. I could tell from watching your struggle up close.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Your lack of ability is my responsibility. I wasn&#39;t able to summon you into a proper form.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Why don&#39;t you blame me before you die, like the others?</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> Well, heh-heh. You still don&#39;t get it, do you, Master?</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> \u2013I enjoyed myself. I had so much fun.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> We&#39;re counterfeit Heroic Spirits. We&#39;ve been able to indulge in the vice, masochism, and folly that our true personalities never could.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> Thanks to you, Master, I&#39;ve had a ridiculously good time.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> You gave us so much pleasure. Why would we blame you?</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> The emotions you gave us, the fictional backstory... they&#39;re no more than a starting point.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> We began there, and fell in love with you along the way.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> It pains me to say it, but this is the end for me.

What a joke.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> It sounded to me like she was being honest.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> It&#39;s a joke. I created the seven counterfeit Heroic Spirits as pawns for my amusement.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> They have no respect, affection, or trust.

Unbelievable.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Dark Jeanne d&#39;Arc. Let&#39;s set aside counterfeit paintings and sculptures.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> As far as counterfeit Heroic Spirits go, you&#39;re on the right track. You said your goal was to surpass the original...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...but you&#39;ve already created counterfeits that surpass the originals.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> After all, the originals are bound by their sense of heroism.

It couldn&#39;t have been fun.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> None of them complained.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Ridiculous. What are you saying? They must have felt bitter.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> I summoned them by force, but wasn&#39;t satisfied, so I even altered their parameters.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> They may have acted as my subordinates on the surface, but must have despised me on the inside!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Listen, I&#39;m Leonardo da Vinci, creator of many original works.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Do you think I can&#39;t tell whether something is genuine or fake? They sincerely enjoyed themselves.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Well more than the original Servants at that. They had concern for and deeply cared about you.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> What Fujimaru said is important, too. This is a Master who has been through many scenes of bloodshed.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> [\u2642 He /\u2640 She] said it best.

Are you a calculator?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Whether you&#39;re a Heroic Spirit or an Anti-Hero, Fujimaru is the perfect five-star Master.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> So, what are you going to do?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ... ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ... ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ... ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...It&#39;s my loss.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> You admit defeat?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> I will admit my defeat, with one exception.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> I admit to an inferiority complex over that Holy Maiden. I admit to a craving to be sought after.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> I admit to having smoldering hatred in my heart even now.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> And I admit that no matter how much success I achieve, how many lives I save\u2014 I&#39;ll always be an Avenger who is never satisfied.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> But even so, with all the sins this hopeless Avenger has committed,</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> if you still wish for this strength, this flag of hatred, I will respond to your summon, last Master of the world.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master... You did it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Then let&#39;s go ho\u2013</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Now, let&#39;s begin our final battle to the death!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> H-Huh!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> What? Demi-Servant, why are you looking at me with wide eyes? We&#39;re going to fight.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh? But... Didn&#39;t you just surrender!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> \u2013No, I did no such thing. Don&#39;t tell me you thought I would just go off to Chaldea with you?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I-I did. Or at least I don&#39;t think a duel to the death is necessary.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> It is. After all, you people defeated my pawns.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> As the one who stands above all counterfeit Heroic Spirits, I will never back down from a fight. I will fight with all my strength. That&#39;s nonnegotiable.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> After all\u2014 I&#39;m an exceptionally wicked Heroic Spirit. You think I&#39;d let someone who defied me get away so easily?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> ...Sheesh. Just what we need. Somebody with pride in being an evil leader.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Only one thing to do. Give up and fight, Master.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> But look at the bright side. This will be our last fight with her.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> But...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Fujimaru. I mean Master.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I&#39;m sure you already realize this. She needs this fight more than anyone.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> If we blew it off here, she would have a lifelong grudge against you.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I mean... Put it this way. Scary as she is, you would hate for that to happen, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Get ready to fight!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Oui. Yes, that&#39;s it. That impudent expression!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> How many times did I want to make you kneel in Orleans?! How many times did I want to trample you!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> \u2013It&#39;s time to hit the dirt, originals!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> !!! Here come the remaining enemies too!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Mash Kyrielight, ready for combat!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...Ahhh, that wasn&#39;t enough, huh? But that&#39;s okay.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> It was fun, just like that horror movie woman said. I had a lot of fun!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> That&#39;s why this story and I shall end here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Ahhh, this is so vexing! But that&#39;s fine.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> The future me will form a bond with you. The current me will have a hearty laugh and go off into the sunset.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> I&#39;m sure the future me won&#39;t have any memories of being a counterfeit Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> So the current me at least wanted to make one last memory\u2013 So I wouldn&#39;t be lonely.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...I guess it&#39;s about time. Good. You&#39;ve embarrassed me enough.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> You&#39;d better take full responsibility... Goodbye.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master. We&#39;ve recovered a fragment of the Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Just as Elisabeth retrieved a Holy Grail fragment back in Orleans...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...it seems Jeanne Alter also obtained a fragment from somewhere.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Her elimination is confirmed. Now there&#39;s no more danger of counterfeit proliferation.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Good work. You can come back now. Although you could also retrieve the remaining counterfeits.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Master, you were right. Sometimes there are people who just need to be defeated.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> There are people who can&#39;t admit defeat and move on until it&#39;s too late.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> She had to be defeated precisely because she has gained the qualification to be summoned as a Servant.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yes, that&#39;s right. There are people in this world who need to be defeated before they can move forward.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Well, shall we go home? For a shut-in like me, the turmoil this time was a lot to bear!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I think you should get some exercise once in a while, Da Vinci, instead of tinkering with your strange inventions all the time.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Huh? I use an exercise bike in my room so I don&#39;t particularly need more exercise than this.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Why, I got a clear understanding of just how athletic you are. To think you were good at close combat...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> As soon as we get back, King Leonidas and I will come up with a training menu to make you fit enough to stand on the front line.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I don&#39;t want a total muscle-building menu! If I get muscles, I&#39;ll lose this golden ratio!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Don&#39;t worry. A little training and we&#39;ll send you to the front. I bet you&#39;re looking forward to that day, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I can&#39;t wait to have her on the team.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> A bulked-up Da Vinci!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You can forget about that idea! I&#39;m not ready to go anywhere!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Unless something dire happens, I&#39;m not going to the front! Keep that in miiiiiiind!</p>',978),a=[r];function i(g,h){return e(),o("div",null,a)}var l=t(s,[["render",i],["__file","counterfeit.html.vue"]]);export{l as default};
