I have a small favor to ask.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> Do you have time to spare?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> No problem</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What happened?</p><hr><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> ...I wish to go back to the 1431 France. There is something I wish to recover\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...We&#39;ve arrived in France. Now Gilles, what is it that you want to recover?</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> It&#39;s Jeanne&#39;s sword. It&#39;s the sword of innocence that she discovered at Saint Catherine&#39;s Church.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> It went missing when she was captured, but... I thought I might be able to find it now.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I see. In that case, let&#39;s head for Orleans.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...Oh? I&#39;m picking up something in your surroundings.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;ve can confirm that... It&#39;s not humans. It appears to be corpses possessed by ghosts.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> It is a mystery\u2013but at any rate, let&#39;s take them out. It&#39;s not going to be pleasant to let them live.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> That&#39;s the last of them. Also it&#39;s strange, why would the corpses\u2013</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> Well, let&#39;s move on anyway.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> Whoa!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> Mash, Master, are you both all right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, I&#39;m fine. But there are so many corpses here.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> Hmm. There might be something.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> Saint Catherine&#39;s sword is important, but we must figure out what&#39;s causing them to revive, too...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Nine times out of ten, it&#39;s some suspicious virus\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We&#39;re already busy retrieving the Holy Grail, so I decline to deal with such a biohazard!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> Hahaha, it can&#39;t be that. I sense a slight trace of magical energy out of their bodies.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> It has something to do with magical means, not biological.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What&#39;s wrong Fou? Should we go this way?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> We should follow him.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Let&#39;s follow his orders.</p><hr><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> Yes. Rather than running in the dark, we should put our faith in beast&#39;s instincts.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> Hm, we&#39;ve got more of them here. Master, stay behind us.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> Miss Mash, let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Right!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> ...Whew. Well, we managed to clean it up somehow.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. But aside from that, what exactly is here\u2013</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Oh, a warning! A strong magical energy signature detected near the throne.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> If left alone, it may lead to the birth of another singularity. Could you investigate the possibility?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Understood\u2014 Ahhh!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> What&#39;s this! Can this be, Saint Catherine&#39;s sword!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The shadows are gathering, and they&#39;re trying to change their form. This is...a Shadow Servant!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> Ugh! So, you&#39;ve been searching for the sword!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> I hate to break it to you, but that sword is not yours. You will hand it over!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...It&#39;s coming!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> Got it!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Target elimination confirmed. If you retrieve that sword, all should return to normal.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> Yes, we&#39;ve retrieved the sword.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> ...Master, are you familiar with the legend of Jeanne d&#39;Arc and this sword?</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> She always waved the flag to encourage us and was always on the front lines, but\u2013</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> She never drew her sword.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> I asked her if she was afraid of getting blood on her hands. She gave me a peculiar answer.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> &quot;No, for when I wave this flag, my hands become one with yours.&quot;</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> &quot;However, I am embarrassed to say that I am unskilled with the sword. Forgive me.&quot;</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> She never drew her sword. However, she carried our sin with us.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> \u2013That being the case, I will not tolerate anyone drawing this sword but her.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> Someday, somewhere, she will need to draw this sword. Until then, I must protect it properly.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> ...I appreciate you accommodating my personal affairs.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> Let&#39;s continue to fight together!</p>',67),a=[n];function i(h,g){return s(),e("div",null,a)}var p=t(r,[["render",i],["__file","Gilles de Rais - Saber.html.vue"]]);export{p as default};
