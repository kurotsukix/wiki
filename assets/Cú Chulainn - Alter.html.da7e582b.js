Or at least, that would be the case were there no opponents awaiting the team.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Is this mere chance? The whim of a Demon God Pillar? Or is it simply human error?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Whatever the case, on that day in 2018, only a short while after C\xFA Chulainn Alter was summoned...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Humanity&#39;s last Master, Fujimaru, was in a dire situation.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Hm? Dire situations are the order of the day here? Well, be that as it may, THIS particular situation was something rather special.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Master&#39;s most trusted Servant, Mash Kyrielight, was not by [\u2642 his /\u2640\uFE0F her} side.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> It was not long after the difficult, arduous task of correcting the Singularity in America had been completed.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Of all Chaldea&#39;s Servants, [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she} took only C\xFA Chulainn Alter...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...on a forty-eight hour journey.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Bluntly, an Alter is another side of us...just another possibility.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> For example: heroes, no matter what kind of life they lived, almost always end up with blood on their hands.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Even heroes who like to think of themselves as good remain aware that they have a merciless side to them.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> What would happen if their other side was brought to the forefront? Pretty obvious, don&#39;t you think?</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> It goes without saying that we are conscious that our living selves and ourselves as we are now are more or less the same.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> However, even I cannot make any claim to sainthood.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> A virtuous king can turn cold-blooded. A cold-blooded king becomes virtuous.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> A mad dog of a knight had a time to shine bright. And the opposite rings true.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> And there are those who fell from grace, those who fell into darkness, or were driven into it by events beyond their control.</p><p><strong>Gilles de Rais:</strong> ...Lamentably, I cannot argue that point.</p><p><strong>Gilles de Rais:</strong> That is the man I ultimately become. An Anti-Hero, a mass-murderer, a truly evil man.</p><p><strong>Gilles de Rais:</strong> As painful as it may be, it is not something I can simply avoid...</p><p><strong>Gilles de Rais:</strong> I must acknowledge that he is another side of me... I mustn&#39;t avert my gaze from that truth...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> The real issue is that they&#39;re not exactly just another side of us. They&#39;ve mutated somehow.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> The other me fused with Medb&#39;s far-fetched idea of me as a king.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Guess it happened since humanity is so unstable. Otherwise, I&#39;d have been less of a jerk.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> What? You scared, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Not really.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Don&#39;t act so tough.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> We lost communication, we&#39;re low on food and water, and I&#39;m the only Servant you&#39;ve got.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Standing there, saying you&#39;re not scared? Liar.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Well, to be honest...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> I knew it.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> We lost communication, we&#39;re low on food and water, and I&#39;m the only Servant you&#39;ve got.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Even your trusty Shielder isn&#39;t here.</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Anyone would be scared out of their wits. Right?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Don&#39;t give me that look.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> We did try to kill each other the last time we were here. Am I wrong?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> No, I&#39;m not. You and I fought to the death. You, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> If you&#39;re a Master, you are responsible for your Servants in battle. No matter the opponent, the ultimate decision to fight is on you.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> That&#39;s why I fought against you and lost. Isn&#39;t that right?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> But now it&#39;s just a faint memory. Look at that. While we were chit-chatting, enemies surrounded us.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> So what&#39;ll it be, Master? Retreat or meet the attack head-on? You better choose.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Attack.</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Got it. Good, a quick decision. You didn&#39;t even hesitate. I like it.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Now it&#39;s time for a massacre. This lot isn&#39;t even hardy enough to be a good meal.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Still, no harm in an appetizer here and there!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Normally, if I were summoned as a Berserker, I would turn out pretty different.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> But from what I remember, the raged-out me is probably the world&#39;s biggest good-for-nothing.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> So maybe HE is at least the lesser of two evils.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Hey! We&#39;re connected! All right!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Doctor!</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Oh. Hey. Glad you&#39;re doing okay.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> We were monitoring your vitals this whole time on our end, but I couldn&#39;t relax until I saw your face in person!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Hey. You aren&#39;t looking in person. You&#39;re yammering from a safe, cushy office. Who the hell do you think you are?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Ugh, well... I can&#39;t really argue that.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> ...I was only speaking on your behalf.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> He&#39;s completely right, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> When you come back, I&#39;ll treat you to my favorite sesame buns by way of apology.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Is that the best you can do?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Eh? Uh...um...my favorite bean buns? Hngh...this is gonna cost me...!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Master, I am not certain your boss is a good or worthwhile human being.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I sometimes wonder the same thing.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Oh come on.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That&#39;s not exactly news.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Just...consider all that an attempt to lighten the mood with a silly joke!</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...Aaanywho, that&#39;s enough chitchat.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> You&#39;re in a bit of a dangerous situation right now... We have two choices about how to retrieve you.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Our first option would be to conduct a forced Rayshift. It&#39;s dangerous, but it&#39;s probably the best way to deal with the current situation.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...Let me emphasize that this will be dangerous.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It will be a great deal harder on you than a normal Rayshift.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Second option: I&#39;ve already pinpointed your coordinates. You should be able to make your way to Mash on foot.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> If you do that, we can Rayshift you back normally.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> However, Mash is a little far. It will take you at least forty-eight hours to reach her.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Forty-eight hours...</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Ha. Well, well. You&#39;ve gotten yourself into quite the mess, Master.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Is he saying there&#39;s a chance he might betray Master?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Who knows? Tough question.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> No matter how levelheaded Berserkers may seem, they&#39;re all pretty unhinged.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> However, if they&#39;re completely lost to madness, there is a possibility that they could make a mad dash without thinking twice... Maybe.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Either way, I can&#39;t imagine even the other side of me would do something like that.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Honestly, the opposite is more likely, I think.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> ...I don&#39;t sense any enemies nearby.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Thanks.</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Just doing my job as a Servant. Quit thanking me every time.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> But...</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Irritating.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> That&#39;s just the natural relationship between Master and their Servants.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> I may be born from malice and bizarre circumstance, but I am still C\xFA Chulainn.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Kill my enemies. Protect my allies.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> That is how it goes for all Celtic folk: we kill whether they be enemies or allies.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> And I&#39;m not so squeamish as to let others do my dirty work.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Got it.</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Good. Rest up. I&#39;ll keep watch.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Oh. Before you go to sleep, there&#39;s one thing I want to ask you.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> ...Why did you choose to do it this way?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> No way can I let myself die here.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> ...Figured as much.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Had you chosen the forceful Rayshift option in an attempt to get away from it all, and some kind of accident happened...the world would be over.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Eh, just &#39;cause.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> ...Hmph.</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> But now, you&#39;re stuck with me for another thirty-six hours.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> You have no other allies here, and nobody else can help you. This time we have together will be like torture... Are you sure you can make it out alive?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I am.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Oh really?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;m not... At least, not if I&#39;m alone.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> ...I see.</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Time to head out, [\u2642 boy /\u2640\uFE0F girl}. Get a move on.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> And one more thing: hydrate yourself from the tree roots before we leave the forest. We won&#39;t have another chance to get any water for a while.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...I&#39;ve got some bad news.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> I doubt you could tell us much that would make matters worse.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> We&#39;ve detected a large group of enemies up ahead.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> They&#39;re spread out all over the place. Trying to go around would add about two hundred hours to your trip.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Considering your food and water supplies, your psychological state, and your current vitals, I recommend you Rayshift immediately.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It shouldn&#39;t be so much of a cause for concern now. Our chances of success have gone up. It should be fine...probably...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Enemies? Then I&#39;ll kill them.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> There&#39;s just too many of them.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Plus, our analysis of enemy activity shows they&#39;re in constant communication with each other.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Once they&#39;re engaged, they&#39;ll just keep calling for reinforcements until they&#39;ve killed their target.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Matters might have been different if Mash were there, but there&#39;s just no way you can protect Fujimaru alone.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> ...Huh. Nice pep talk.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Well then. Master, we&#39;re going to find a place for you to hide.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Then I&#39;ll go slaughter them all.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Come on, don&#39;t be absurd!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> First and foremost, I can&#39;t let you just leave Fujimaru alone!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> As it is, there&#39;s no choice.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> If I fail, then you can just Rayshift or whatever you want to do.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Let&#39;s review.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> You&#39;ll stay here and find some food and water.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> I&#39;ll go swing my lance around a bit, even throw out my Noble Phantasm. Once I&#39;ve swept all the enemies away, I&#39;ll call for you.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Got it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I don&#39;t like it.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> What, are you going to tag along?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Don&#39;t you think I should go with you?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> You out of your damn mind?</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> If you pull something like that, the whole plan&#39;s a waste. The enemy&#39;s after you.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> You wanna be dead weight slowing me down? And you call yourself a Master...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> ...I want to say that I understand what you&#39;re saying.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> \u201CI don&#39;t want you to die and I don&#39;t want to die.\u201D</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> But the whole Master-Servant relationship isn&#39;t that simple.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> I don&#39;t think betrayal is a concern, but I&#39;d say death is imminent.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> In a normal Grail War, a Master only thinks of their Servants as familiars, which causes some trouble.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Most Masters are good-for-nothing mages. It&#39;s no wonder they don&#39;t get along with Heroic Spirits.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Well, some Servants tolerate them, but some Servants cross the line.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> But that guy is the opposite. He understands that he&#39;s just a familiar, and acts accordingly.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> So that&#39;s why if Master&#39;s life&#39;s in danger...I think he&#39;d throw his life away to protect [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her} without hesitating.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> It&#39;s not something he&#39;d do out of affection so much as just the sort of service he feels is appropriate.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Goring Spear of Slaughter...G\xE1e Bolg!!!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I don&#39;t believe it. I knew his NP is Anti-Army, but he wiped out a third of the enemies.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Quit mocking me. It&#39;s ONLY a third. Until I&#39;ve massacred the rest of them, this isn&#39;t a victory.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> If only you weren&#39;t alone, and if only there wasn&#39;t such an endless tide of enemies...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Heh. I&#39;m used to this.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> No matter how I look at this, you&#39;ll only be able to get through half of them at best. I recommend you give up and make a temporary retreat.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> And what would happen if we retreat?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Well...you&#39;ll just have to start all over again.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Screw that.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Backup from Chaldea has its limits. If we turn back and start all over again, this [\u2642 boy /\u2640\uFE0F girl} definitely won&#39;t last.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I don&#39;t know... I think you underestimate Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Let me say this again: at best you can take out half. They may not be individually strong, but their sheer numbers are overwhelming.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> That&#39;s nothing new for a lone Servant out in the battlefield.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Oh, right.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I forgot that C\xFA Chulainn fought through an army of Medb&#39;s soldiers all by himself.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> But still, you&#39;re a Servant now. We don&#39;t have sufficient magical energy for you to keep exerting your true power like that.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> ...Figured as much.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> You think that&#39;s why you have a Master, huh.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> A supplier of magical energy for manifestation... A link to maintain your existence.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> That, and that alone, is what you believe a Master&#39;s purpose to be.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> What else would it be?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Unfortunately for you, there&#39;s a good deal more to it.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Now that you&#39;ve taken out a third of the enemies, we can ensure [\u2642 his /\u2640\uFE0F her} safety from our end.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Huh? What the hell are you talking about...? You&#39;re not saying...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Fujimaru! It&#39;s your turn! Support him as a Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Got it, Doctor!</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Damn.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It&#39;ll be okay. Your Master overcame the catastrophe that was the demonic fog in London, so you&#39;ll be fine!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;ve sent you all the data we have on the enemies. Now, fight alongside C\xFA Chulainn Alter!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> We&#39;ve managed to get rid of a good number. Okay, we&#39;re going to dash through.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Are you angry?</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> I don&#39;t agree, but I&#39;m not mad.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> ...But now I know you&#39;re that kind of Master. From here on, I just have to handle you differently.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Come on, we&#39;re going to walk a bit more. Master, what about food and water?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Uh...</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> ...You wanna starve? We can&#39;t go back.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Chew on tree roots and lick the stones. Don&#39;t you dare complain. This is your own doing!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> And after that?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Afterward, they managed to meet up with Mash Kyrielight, and that was it.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Nothing was physically gained from that incident, but they went through a valuable experience...at least I want to think so.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Even for Fujimaru, chewing on tree roots to survive isn&#39;t an everyday occurrence.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Report completed. Recorder is \u25A1\u25A1\u3000\u25A1\u25A1\u25A1\u25A1\u25A1\u25A1\u25A1\u25A1.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Now then...I wonder if someone&#39;s going to read through this massive Rayshift report someday.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Or maybe it will never see the light of day...considering the future to be saved, and what lies after that.</p><h2 id="kill-like-a-beast-fight-for-carnage" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#kill-like-a-beast-fight-for-carnage" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Kill Like a Beast, Fight for Carnage</h2><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...He once said no one should bother trying to understand him.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> That sometimes, understanding can lead to hatred, and that hatred can lead to mistakes.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> So one must never try to understand a Berserker.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> For understanding is not in their nature.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Tch...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Are you okay?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Of course I am.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> I have to keep on winning now.

I might not be long for this world, but I&#39;m not done for yet.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;ll heal you!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Don&#39;t bother.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Semiramis made this...and she&#39;s been poisoning people longer than anyone.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> A few cure spells aren&#39;t gonna do shit.</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> So, five to go... Better take care of them before the poison spreads too far.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Still no sign of what time period this is, or a place where we can get a look at this whole Singularity.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Ah well, that&#39;s not important. The main thing is finding the other Servants.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> ...What? You still worried about the poison or something?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s part of it, but...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Yeah?</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s just, you have so little regard for yourself...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> ...You haven&#39;t changed a bit, have you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I don&#39;t get you.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> You don&#39;t have to get me. Servants are just machines.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> And there&#39;s no point in caring for a machine like it was a person.</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> ...Getting back to what matters here...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> There&#39;s definitely something odd about this Singularity. Some parts look like the Far East, others like South America.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> And on top of that, I don&#39;t see any signs of people anywhere. We can&#39;t just keep stumbling around and hope for the best.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Any bright ideas, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Maybe we could find somewhere to go if we made a boat?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> ...Forget it. Every bone in my body&#39;s telling me that&#39;s a bad idea.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> I&#39;m guessing we could sail all the way around this world and still not find anywhere to go.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Maybe a cave or something...?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Yeah, that makes sense.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> It&#39;d be a good idea to find shelter in a cave, in part so you can get some rest.</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> All right, let&#39;s see if we can find a cave. But first...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> ...I&#39;m gonna kill these guys and get &#39;em off our backs. Give me some space, Master.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong> ...Please don&#39;t think poorly of me. It&#39;s nothing personal.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong> Aww, you&#39;re the guy we gotta take out, C\xFA? Well that sucks!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong> Come on, why don&#39;t you ditch the loser and join us?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Don&#39;t be ridiculous. I can&#39;t do that.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong> It&#39;s not that. You&#39;re merely loyal to a fault.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong> Becoming an Alter has done nothing to change that.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong> True. You just wouldn&#39;t be C\xFA if you went around ditching your charge.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong> So it&#39;d make me real happy if you just agreed to roll over and kick the bucket to get out of this Holy Grail War!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Holy Grail War?</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong> I see little point in telling you more, as you are about to die.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong> Let&#39;s begin.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong> Hmm, I don&#39;t know how I feel about this. Facing you when you&#39;re poisoned seems like a geis from when you were still alive...</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong> No, wait, I totally know how I feel! This is just as exciting now as it was back then! I can&#39;t wait to back you into a corner and finish you off!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Come try.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> When this is over, there won&#39;t be so much as a speck left of either of you!</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong> I see. So that ferocity is what made you a Berserker.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong> You have narrowed your focus so much that you&#39;ve blinded yourself to anything other than your goal.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong> But remember this, warrior of Ulster: that very part of you is what weighs on your Master the most.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Every breath I take is agony. I have no idea what I should do.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> So I tear into the enemy in front of me. That&#39;s all I&#39;m meant for.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> That&#39;s what warriors have always done, especially when we&#39;re berserk.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong> A true hero...kills with his eyes!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Tch...!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong> Bring it! Chariot My Love!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Is that a joke, Medb!?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong> He took it head-on!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Here, Karna. You can have this back!</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong> Karna!</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong> ...It would seem this is it for me...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> You left yourself open, Medb.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong> Huh!? Oh shi\u2013</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> G\xE1e Bolg...!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong> Guh...!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> It&#39;s over. Now it&#39;s your turn to die.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong> Heh, hehe... Owww... That was...a good hit.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong> You win this one. But...there&#39;s still three Servants left. Think you can take them all with your body falling apart?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Shut up.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong> Hehe... See you...on the other side.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> C\xFA Chulainn!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Alter!</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> ...Come on... We need to keep going.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Can we at least rest a little?</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> ?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> ...Yeah, all right. You stay here and hold down the fort.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Meantime...I&#39;ll go finish off the last three.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Can you just trust me?</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> ...It&#39;s not that. If I didn&#39;t trust you, I&#39;d have killed you long ago.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> ...Karna said I&#39;m a burden for you as I am now.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> He&#39;s probably right.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> For some reason...I&#39;m dead set on handling everything on my own.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Allies, comrades, friends...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Anyone who&#39;s supposed to help share the load just ends up making it heavier for me.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> That goes for you too, Master.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> As much as I&#39;m a burden for you, you&#39;re a burden for me.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> So you just sit tight here while I go take care of this.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So now, here I am, all on my own...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Something about this doesn&#39;t feel right...</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong> Huh, what do you know. You must be that Master of Chaldea [\u2642 fellow /\u2640\uFE0F lady}.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Andersen...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> That&#39;s me.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> A third-rate Servant, and the only one to voluntarily drop out of this Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> If you already know who I am, that&#39;ll save us some time. Now, what are you doing here?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Is your Servant staying out of the Holy Grail War?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> \u201CHoly Grail War\u201D is kind of stretching it...</p><hr><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> True, this one is much different than the usual battle royale.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Instead of fighting each other, all seven Servants are working together to keep the Holy Grail safe from a single opposing Servant.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Of course, since it won&#39;t make any difference if I&#39;m there fighting or not, I decided I&#39;d go ahead and sit it out right here.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Besides, it doesn&#39;t matter how many of us our enemy defeats. There&#39;s no way he&#39;s getting through Heracles.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Heracles...!</p><hr><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Yup. The greatest hero in all of Greek myth. If most Servants can hit like a truck, Herc is more like a goddamn freight train. Only a fool would take him on.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> So, what are you doing here, anyway, Master of Chaldea?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Well...</p><hr><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Hmm. He prefers to go it on his own, huh.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> That certainly sounds like something C\xFA Chulainn Alter would say.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> The original C\xFA Chulainn was a Celtic warrior through and through. For him, both enemy and ally alike could be a friend...depending on his mood.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> ...But it sounds like all of that&#39;s gone in C\xFA Chulainn Alter.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> So he thinks it&#39;s fine for everyone else to be weak, and as long as he&#39;s strong, everything will be fine.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> He also thinks it&#39;s just fine to keep his charges at a distance, and doesn&#39;t care if he gets hurt.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> What a joke!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Doesn&#39;t he realize that&#39;s exactly the sort of behavior that ends up hurting the ones he&#39;s supposed to be protecting?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> That&#39;s the whole reason why you&#39;re hurt and moping around in here now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I see.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Good. Then get out of here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> So that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been feeling...</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Now do you get it? Only one thing left for you to do.</p><hr><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Hurry up and go find him. Once you&#39;re out of these woods, turn left and keep heading straight.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> You&#39;ll see a cave there. That is where this war will come to an end.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Thank you, Andersen.</p><hr><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> I&#39;ve got no use for your gratitude. You don&#39;t look like you could afford one of my books anyway.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> So get lost. Go do what a Master&#39;s supposed to do.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> If he succeeds at defeating the last two Servants, it won&#39;t take long for this Singularity to disappear.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I can hear them fighting...!</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Hraaaaaaaaah!!!</p><p><strong>Heracles:</strong></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png" alt="berserk2"></p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> (Huff, huff, huff...)</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Master? What&#39;re you... Why&#39;re you here?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m here to fight.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Just felt like it.</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> ...Tch. Fine. Suit yourself.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yep.</p><hr><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...So, the Master makes [\u2642 his /\u2640\uFE0F her} appearance.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> But you are too late. Your blade will never reach me.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Our Berserker&#39;s victory is assured.</p><p><strong>Heracles:</strong></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png" alt="berserk2"></p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Not yet. This isn&#39;t over yet!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> My body&#39;s falling apart. My mind&#39;s going with it.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> And I&#39;m up against the strongest hero in all of Greek myth. A monster who completed the Twelve Labors and obtained immortality.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I know I&#39;ve killed him several times, but he keeps coming back to life and absolutely crushing me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I can feel my bones grinding. I can feel my muscles tearing.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> But so what?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I&#39;m here to win. To keep winning.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...It doesn&#39;t matter if Master&#39;s here or not. I don&#39;t need [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her}. And yet...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Tch...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Heal!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Enhance!</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Thanks for the help, but stay out of this. ...Just sit back and watch.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...God, this sucks.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Just having [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her} here is making me and my spear stronger...!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...Oho.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> So you managed to reach me even without defeating Heracles.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...Very well. Then I shall join the battle as well.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...Prepare to taste the steel of my sacred sword, warrior of Ulster.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> No thanks.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Don&#39;t go spacing out on me, Master. We&#39;ve got a battle to win.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Right...!</p><hr><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> I&#39;m pulling out all my curses. No more holding back.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> ...Let&#39;s go kill us some Servants. Curruid Coinchenn...!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Haaaaaaaaaaaah!!!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...Impressive.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> I don&#39;t see the Caster anywhere... I take it you&#39;re the last one?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> That is correct.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> So, why were you guys summoned, anyway?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...I do not know.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> All I know is that we were made to wait here, peacefully, until you two arrived.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> We were then ordered to kill you. Nothing more.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> This can only mean one of two things. Whoever summoned us hates either Chaldea, or you.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> ...I see.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> So this was just a big experiment.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Perhaps.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...Watch yourself, Master of Chaldea...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> It&#39;s over.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Heeey! Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Phew, it looks like you&#39;re all right. That&#39;s a relief.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Once we got cut off from voice comms, the only thing we could do was track your vital signs...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Though at least they remained stable the whole time. Everything okay on your end?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;ll explain when we get back.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Oho, sounds like we&#39;re in for a good story.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Well, more or less...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I see, I see.</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> All right, since it looks like you&#39;re all done cleaning up there, we&#39;ll get ready to bring you back.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Just let us know when you&#39;re done.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> ...Someone with a grudge against us, huh. Guess there&#39;s still a Demon God Pillar out there somewhere.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> Must be rough, having someone wish you were dead for saving humanity.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> But anyway...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> ...if you&#39;ve got an enemy you need good and dead, just give me a shout and I&#39;ll come running.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn Alter:</strong> That&#39;s what Berserkers are supposed to do, after all.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...Man, this sucks.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> My own eventual death&#39;s probably gonna be a real shitshow...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...but I guess at least one person&#39;s gonna be sad when I&#39;m gone.</p>',547),a=[s];function i(h,g){return n(),o("div",null,a)}var p=t(e,[["render",i],["__file","C\xFA Chulainn - Alter.html.vue"]]);export{p as default};
