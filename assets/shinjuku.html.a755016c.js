Understood.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It certainly has gotten messy, what with everything that&#39;s happened over the last year.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We&#39;re overdue for a spring clean. I, Mash Kyrielight, will have this place spick and span in no time!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Thank you, Fou, but we&#39;ll be fine. Please wait here until we&#39;re done.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hey you two! How&#39;s things?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Hey, it&#39;s the slacker queen.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yikes. That&#39;s a bit harsh! Even geniuses slack off once in a while!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Shouldn&#39;t you be, I dunno, working, Da Vinci?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Uh, isn&#39;t it obvious? I&#39;m slacking off.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Seriously, Da Vinci?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hey, don&#39;t give me that look. Part of my job is making sure the two of you are in tip-top shape!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Oh, and if any of the higher-ups ask where I am, tell them I&#39;m not here, &#39;kay?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Tell them we geniuses need three times more rest than most people so we can work thirty times more efficiently.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ugh...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, I think these are your personal belongings, Senpai. What would you like me to do with them?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Put them there on the shelves, please.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Those? Just throw them under the bed.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Okay, Senpai.... I see the top of this shelf is very dusty.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;ll go ahead and clean here too!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Okay, I know what I&#39;m going to do.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;m going to play with Fou.</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou! (Scampers)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpaaai!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This is YOUR room, Senpai. You&#39;re the one who has to clean it!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Come on, Senpai. Stop grinning!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Okay, got it. Under the bed it is then.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Fou!? What are you doing hiding under Senpai&#39;s bed?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh no, now you&#39;re all covered in dust!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou! (Shakes)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Stop it, Fou! You&#39;re getting the bed all dusty!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...It&#39;s so peaceful now.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Whew. That takes care of this part of your room.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Since Da Vinci&#39;s here too, why don&#39;t we take a little break, Senpai?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;ll go make some tea.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Thank you, Fou. It&#39;s nice of you to keep me company. Be back soon, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I&#39;m glad to see her in high spirits again, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> She&#39;s still not completely healed?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yes and no. Her exam results were all perfect.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Her cell structure has rejuvenated to that of a teenager, and her nerves and blood vessels are like new.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But the nonhuman parts of her...That&#39;s another story.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The enormous magical energy she possessed as a Demi-Servant is gone, and her magical circuits have jammed.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You&#39;ve learned a lot about magecraft over the last year, so you know that magical circuits last for life.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Whenever a mage uses a spell, they flip a switch to turn on the magical circuits inside their body.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> This activates them and voil\xE0! They can cast spells. When they don&#39;t need them, they flip the switch back.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Basically, the switch is always there, and your ability to use spells depends on whether it&#39;s on or off.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But right now, there&#39;s no way to turn Mash&#39;s circuits on, even though the circuits themselves are fine.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It&#39;s kind of like the switch is jammed, and can&#39;t be flipped.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Does that mean she&#39;s sick, or...?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> No. I give you my personal, universal genius guarantee that there is nothing wrong with her physically.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> She&#39;s the very picture of health. You have my word as the world&#39;s most eminent artist.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Does Mash know about this?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Of course. Patients have a right to know about their condition nowadays.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> She was puzzled by this abnormality with her magical circuits too, but she was glad to learn she&#39;s healthy.</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Anyway, we&#39;ll just have to wait and see what happens. Don&#39;t worry. It&#39;ll sort itself out eventually.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I&#39;d add, though, that it might be a good idea for Mash to get out a bit more.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Like, say, going to school.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Great idea!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Yes! Chaldea Academy, opening soon!</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I know, right?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I bet she&#39;d look real good in a student uniform. Although, I guess she already dresses like a student.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I know what you&#39;re thinking.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Naturally, genius that I am, I&#39;m free to wear a student uniform or teach art as I please.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> And no, that does NOT include working at the school shop, thank you very much.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> So, what do you think? The schoolteacher look suits me pretty well, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It...it really does!</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hehehe.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> At any rate.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> If Mash really were to start going to school, I bet she&#39;d have guys and girls alike fawning over her.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You don&#39;t say.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...Is that so.</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> She&#39;d be getting love letters every day...Confessions left and right...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Ahhh, I just love innocent young couples. The teasing opportunities alone make life worth living.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Does anyone even send love letters anymore?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hush, you!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Nobody&#39;s laying a finger on my kouhai!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Da Vinci! Stop filling Senpai&#39;s head with nonsense!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Please don&#39;t pay her any heed, Senpai! ...Here, have some tea! Go on!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Uh, thanks?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> N-no problem. And, Senpai...Please don&#39;t give it another thought, okay?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Aw, come on. Love and romance are important.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Da Vinci!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Okay, okay.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> So, you...seeing anyone right now?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> N-nobody!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> B-besides, I haven&#39;t even had time to think about things like that, what with all that&#39;s happened.</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> All right, enough joking around. You really do need to think about your future, Mash.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You only get to dream big when you&#39;re young. This is your chance to broaden your horizons.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, I know that. It&#39;s just...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Of course, you&#39;ll need someone with experience to help guide you. Isn&#39;t that right, Fujimaru-senpai?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> As her senpai, it&#39;s your job to make sure Mash has a bright future ahead of her, don&#39;t you think?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;d be glad to help!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Oh, I am ON IT!</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Now that&#39;s what I like to hear.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Come to think of it, those people from the Mage&#39;s Association didn&#39;t stick around very long, did they.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> We must&#39;ve overloaded their poor minds with the sheer quantity of data we&#39;ve gathered over the last year.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Between Chaldea summons and on-site summons, we easily called upon more than a hundred Servants.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> And then there was us visiting Singularities in seven different eras, and the ten-plus Rayshifts to minor Singularities in between.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Normally, a Rayshift is a major event, and requires approval from the Mage&#39;s Association AND the UN!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> We may have done it to save the world, but we still broke all sorts of regulations.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Still, the fact remains that we saved the world.... Um, Senpai?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You okay, Mash?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What is it?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I just overheard this while making the tea.</p><p><strong>Staff A:</strong> Are you kidding me!?</p><p><strong>Staff B:</strong> Hey, don&#39;t shoot the messenger. As soon as the first team gets here, they&#39;re going to shake things up with the staff.</p><p><strong>Staff B:</strong> Looks like they&#39;re foisting a bunch of well-known mages from all sorts of fields on us.</p><p><strong>Staff B:</strong> We still don&#39;t have the complete list, but here&#39;s a few we know are coming:</p><p><strong>Staff B:</strong> Augustus Henrik Asplund, from Valuay. Krast Rene Wegner, from Kishur.</p><p><strong>Staff B:</strong> Valeia Siciliphi, from Mystile. And...Misaria Crowlum, from Chimera.</p><p><strong>Staff B:</strong> As if that weren&#39;t bad enough, it sounds like Policies is getting involved too. They&#39;re talking about completely overhauling Chaldea while they analyze the data.</p><p><strong>Staff A:</strong> A perfect storm of aristocracy, neutrality, and democracy. What gives them the right to\u2013</p><p><strong>Staff B:</strong> Lev Lainur.</p><p><strong>Staff A:</strong> Oh...</p><p><strong>Staff B:</strong> You remember how he served as an advisor, right?</p><p><strong>Staff B:</strong> There&#39;s every possibility he had an accomplice, and it&#39;s entirely possible that if he did, they are still out there.</p><p><strong>Staff B:</strong> That&#39;s why we&#39;ve got a target on our backs.</p><p><strong>Staff B:</strong> We are all under suspicion for an act of terrorism that put 38 top-tier mages in comas.</p><p><strong>Staff B:</strong> And we can&#39;t ask the Animuspheres for help, since they&#39;re still in upheaval after Olga Marie&#39;s death.</p><p><strong>Staff B:</strong> First, they need to designate the family that divided the Animusphere Origin Crest as the new successor, and get the other families&#39; consent.</p><p><strong>Staff B:</strong> Once that&#39;s done, they have to complete all the rituals and get the various approvals needed for succession before they can finally come to Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Staff B:</strong> So by the time that happens, we&#39;ll either have lost all of our authority, or, in the worst case...</p><p><strong>Staff B:</strong> They&#39;ll ignore all our achievements, freeze Chaldea&#39;s assets, and seal everything away...including us.</p><p><strong>Staff A:</strong> Dammit! If only Dr. Roman were still alive...</p><p><strong>Staff B:</strong> Come on, we&#39;ve wasted enough time talking about this.</p><p><strong>Staff B:</strong> Besides, I want to doctor Fujimaru&#39;s file while I still can.</p><p><strong>Staff B:</strong> And you, along with a few other people, are going to help me.</p><p><strong>Staff A:</strong> Huh? Why should I!?</p><p><strong>Staff B:</strong> Okay, listen, let me put it to you like this:</p><p><strong>Staff B:</strong> Do you really think they&#39;ll believe that a Master with no experience, who showed up on the day of the attack just to fill an empty space on the roster...</p><p><strong>Staff B:</strong> ...was able to command SEVERAL different Servants, AND take on the actual heroes of all the time periods [\u2642 he /\u2640 she] visited...</p><p><strong>Staff B:</strong> ...alone, without a modicum of support?</p><p><strong>Staff B:</strong> And finally, that when the dust settled, [\u2642 he /\u2640 she] had actually managed to restore humanity? Because even I don&#39;t believe it!</p><p><strong>Staff B:</strong> We shouldn&#39;t even be alive right now! But we are, and it&#39;s all thanks to [\u2642 him /\u2640 her]!</p><p><strong>Staff A:</strong> Well...I...</p><p><strong>Staff B:</strong> ...Listen, I&#39;m sorry.</p><p><strong>Staff B:</strong> It&#39;s just, when you stop and think about what Fujimaru has accomplished...It&#39;s...unbelievable.</p><p><strong>Staff B:</strong> So much so that the Mage&#39;s Association, Chaldea included, may get caught up in political infighting.</p><p><strong>Staff B:</strong> No. I&#39;m sure they will. And before it&#39;s over, someone&#39;s going to...get disappeared.</p><p><strong>Staff B:</strong> So that&#39;s why I want to edit Fujimaru&#39;s information while I still can, even just a little bit.</p><p><strong>Staff B:</strong> For example, we could have it say \u201CChaldea&#39;s backup was in fine shape, even after the terrorist attack. \u201D</p><p><strong>Staff B:</strong> \u201CThis amateur Master we&#39;ve been relying on was never more than a way to maintain Servant contracts. \u201D</p><p><strong>Staff B:</strong> \u201CDr. Roman was the one who handled all of the complex matters, including the hero negotiations...\u201D And so on.</p><p><strong>Staff B:</strong> ...I know this is wrong. It&#39;ll even end up disgracing Fujimaru&#39;s name.</p><p><strong>Staff B:</strong> But...[\u2642 He&#39;s /\u2640 She&#39;s] been fighting alongside us for over a year now.</p><p><strong>Staff B:</strong> Don&#39;t you want to make sure [\u2642 he /\u2640 she] has a future?</p><p><strong>Staff A:</strong> ...Okay, I&#39;m in. Where do we start?</p><p><strong>Staff B:</strong> Let&#39;s start with Orleans, where the First Singularity was...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Ah...I see.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Well, they&#39;ve actually got the right idea.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> After everything, there&#39;s no doubting that Fujimaru is a hero who saved the world. So, now that the Association knows [\u2642 his /\u2640 her] talent, they&#39;re not going to leave [\u2642 him /\u2640 her] alone.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Assuming, of course, that we just hand over the raw data.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I don&#39;t want Senpai to get caught up in a political battle either.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But, it&#39;s not fair that nobody will know [\u2642 he /\u2640 she] saved the world.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I wouldn&#39;t say \u201Cnobody. \u201D</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Don&#39;t worry, Mash.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You all know.</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> [\u2642 He&#39;s /\u2640 She&#39;s] right. You know, Mash. So do I.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> So does the entire Chaldea staff, and Romani.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> And don&#39;t forget the many Servants [\u2642 he /\u2640 she] formed contracts with.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Heroes, Anti-Heroes, the Servants who gathered at the Temple of Time...They certainly know.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I bet even Goetia gets it.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Each and every one of them knows exactly who is responsible for saving the world.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s more than enough.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I hope you never change, Senpai. I really, truly respect you. You&#39;re amazing!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Besides me, there&#39;s a few others I can think of who are sure to testify that you saved the world.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> There&#39;s Saint Jeanne d&#39;Arc, Maiden of Orleans...Nero Claudius, the Roman emperor...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Francis Drake, the great pirate...Mordred, the Treacherous Knight...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Florence Nightingale, the mother of all nurses...Bedivere, one of King Arthur&#39;s faithful knights...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> And...King Gilgamesh, the Golden King of Heroes.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You couldn&#39;t ask for much better testimony than that.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Of course, it&#39;s possible that they will have no memories from their summoning once they&#39;ve returned to the Throne.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That&#39;s okay.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You don&#39;t crave recognition, do you? ...No, that&#39;s not it.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You truly respect everyone you met while saving the world.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Servants, people...everyone.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> So if they know, and they believe in you, that&#39;s all you need, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai...</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou! Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes? What is it, Fou?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, you want a snack?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Fou kind of seems more innocent these days, doesn&#39;t he?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Now then.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> They&#39;re going to start investigating Chaldea pretty soon, so I think I&#39;m gonna make my escape!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You two can stay here and make sure the whole room is nice and clean. See you later!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Okay. Good luck, Da Vinci. But, um, try not to slack off too much, okay?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Okay, Senpai, shall we get back to cleaning?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Look, there&#39;s still all those Halloween and Christmas decorations piled up in the corner.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We should put these away too!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Let&#39;s do it, Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, Master!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ......</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> There, that looks much better. Now, what next? ...I&#39;ve got it!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We should take this chance to clean the other rooms, so they&#39;ll be ready when the Servants come back\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What the...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s the alarm!</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Wh-what&#39;s going\u2013</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Fujimaru, Mash!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It&#39;s an emergency! I need you to come to the Command Room right away!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Let&#39;s go, Senpai!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AStaff A:</strong> I can&#39;t pinpoint the Singularity&#39;s location! It appears to be confined to an incredibly small area!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Analyze its wavelength! Find out if it&#39;s similar to the other Singularities!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AStaff A:</strong> ...I&#39;ve found it! It&#39;s 74% similar to Singularity F!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Okay, now filter the analysis to major Japanese cities! ...How long will that take!?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AStaff A:</strong> Give me five minutes!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AStaff B:</strong> I&#39;ve got Sheba&#39;s observation results!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AStaff B:</strong> Foundation of Humanity fluctuation is over thirty percent! Almost the same as the seven Singularities.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AStaff B:</strong> Although...That&#39;s strange. Something&#39;s...off.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Off? Off how?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AStaff B:</strong> I-I&#39;m sorry! It may just be my imagination!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AStaff B:</strong> I&#39;ve seen seven Singularities over the past year, and something about this new one just strikes me as...odd.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Don&#39;t dismiss your intuition. I want you to think about what it is until you remember!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AStaff B:</strong> Y-yes ma&#39;am! I&#39;ll start comparing the singularities right away!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AStaff A:</strong> ...I&#39;ve got it now! It&#39;s in Tokyo...in the Shinjuku ward!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That IS small! Shinjuku&#39;s just a single ward in the entire capital city, right?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AStaff A:</strong> The year is...1999!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> 1999...I don&#39;t remember any historic events taking place then.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AStaff A:</strong> No, it was a perfectly ordinary year. There were no events that could result in a Singularity but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Fujimaru, reporting for duty!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Mash Kyrielight, reporting for duty!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Fujimaru! Mash!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What in the world...?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> We&#39;ve got another Singularity!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> How!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> But, isn&#39;t Goetia...?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yes, we know. This shouldn&#39;t even be possible.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Goetia is gone, and the seven Singularities were all repaired. However...one thing always bothered me.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The fact that Singularities pose a threat from the moment of their occurrence.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Look, you&#39;ve been going around quashing every little Singularity that popped up this past year, right?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Those occurred because the emergence of the seven Singularities created some major time distortions, which in turn affected other timelines.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> And just because the seven Singularities were repaired doesn&#39;t mean those distortions simply disappear.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That said, I couldn&#39;t have foreseen that until the appearance of another Singularity on par with those.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...Any way you slice it, this is not good.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> And to make matters worse, the people the Mage&#39;s Association was supposed to send still aren&#39;t here!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Which means...</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You got it! Fujimaru, we have no choice but to ask you to repair this Singularity as well.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I&#39;ve already told the UN and Association that this&#39;ll be part of the Demon God Pillar incident cleanup.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> They weren&#39;t totally on board with it, but they should be satisfied once we send them the data.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> So on that note, Fujimaru, it&#39;s time for you to step up and save the world again!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You mean...Senpai has to fight yet again!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Well...I don&#39;t think any Master who is unfamiliar with what it&#39;s like in a Singularity would stand much of a chance here.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> After all...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It looks like this new Singularity is just as abnormal as the other seven.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I think so too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But...that&#39;s exactly why I think Senpai\u2013I mean,Master\u2013shouldn&#39;t go.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Am I wrong?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> No, you&#39;re not wrong.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But, the fact remains...that right now, Fujimaru is the only Master we&#39;ve got!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Thankfully, we still have some Servants here too. I&#39;ll Rayshift them along with you, so you won&#39;t have to worry about anything while you get to the bottom of this.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> So that&#39;s where we stand.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Da Vinci!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;ll go get ready!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Don&#39;t worry, I promise I&#39;ll come back!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai...</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AStaff C:</strong> The Coffin is ready! We&#39;re good to go anytime!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Good. I&#39;ll be straight with you: the situation is dire, and we have no clue what&#39;s going on!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Mash, you should have a good idea what Romani&#39;s role was by now, right?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You need to verify Fujimaru&#39;s existence so that [\u2642 he doesn&#39;t /\u2640 she doesn&#39;t] disappear.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> [\u2642 His /\u2640 Her] vitals will be in a constant state of flux. Don&#39;t take your eyes off them; if any start to show abnormal values, edit them immediately.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You won&#39;t be able to sleep until things calm down. In some ways, this may be harder than Rayshifting.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But no matter how dire it gets, focus on your Master&#39;s data and keep validating [\u2642 his /\u2640 her] existence.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That&#39;s the best thing you can do for Fujimaru right now.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> How about it? Are you up for it?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I am!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I vow to support Senpai as best I possibly can, or my name isn&#39;t Mash Kyrielight!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I feel safer already.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Even if I can&#39;t go with you, I&#39;ll be right there in spirit.

Let&#39;s get to it then.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Shinjuku, Tokyo. 1999.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> This should be one of the safest times and places in history, but now, something&#39;s going on there.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I know that telling you this is like trying to tell me how to paint, but watch your step out there, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Master Candidate #48, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> If you wish to save humanity...If you wish to have a future beyond 2018.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Then you alone must go and face these seven Singularities in human history.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Are you prepared to do this? Can you shoulder the burden of Chaldea and humanity&#39;s future?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...How pathetic. Looks like I&#39;m the only one who has yet to be mentally prepared.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> But, that&#39;s coming to an end right now. That look on your face, Fujimaru, it&#39;s cheered me up.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> As the acting director of Chaldea, I order you to enter the Coffins.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Please, put an end to his absurd scheme. Prove that an endeavor as hollow as Solomon&#39;s simply needs to go up in flames without anyone ever knowing about it.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Are you all right, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m fine. See you later!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (Rubbing eyes) Yes, I&#39;m fine!</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Okay, then it&#39;s time to board the Coffin!</p><p><strong>Announcement A:</strong> Starting Unsummon Program.

Please, get a hold of yourself!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Not again!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;m falling!?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Th-this is the Seventh Singularity all over again! What&#39;s going on!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> There must be Servants nearby! Let&#39;s ask them for help!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AStaff C:</strong> This can&#39;t be right!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AStaff C:</strong> All the Servants that should have Rayshifted along with Fujimaru have been sent flying!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AStaff C:</strong> Fujimaru doesn&#39;t have any Servants to support [\u2642 him /\u2640 her] anymore!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What!? Da Vinci, you have to call [\u2642 him /\u2640 her] back!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AStaff B:</strong> We can&#39;t!

Or perhaps not.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> Truly a lovely story! A grand take! Unfortunately, though...</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> ...your rescuer is neither a dapper young gentleman, nor a beautiful young lady.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> You must content yourself with yours truly: a rather shady-looking old man.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Who are you!?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> Hah hah! I can&#39;t fault you for your curiosity, but let&#39;s wait until you&#39;re back on the ground first!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Thank you!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> My, my. I&#39;m impressed you have the wherewithal to mind your manners at a time like this.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> You must be exceptionally polite, or exceptionally foolish.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> Let us hope for the former! Now, for the landing!</p><hr><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> Whew! That was no mean feat for a gentleman of fifty or thereabouts.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> But I brought it off perfectly. Not that I would expect anything less of myself.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> Right, then. How are you holding up? No brain damage? Nerves all right? Bones intact?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> Hmmm...Hmmmmmm.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Uh...</p><hr><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> Ah, pardon my lack of manners. I must have been scrutinizing you rather closely.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> Well, don&#39;t mind me; I&#39;m just a dried-up old man. Not much different from being inspected by a machine.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> The important part, of course, is to be certain that you are still fit and able!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> Excellent. Now that that we know you&#39;re well...</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> Welcome to hell, Master of Chaldea!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Hell!?</p><hr><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> Just take a look at what&#39;s happened to this city.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What IS all this...?</p><hr><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> Spellcasters, Demonic Beasts, sentient mannequins, and pseudo-soldiers known as \u201CHornets\u201D...</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> Almost all of the good people have died off, leaving only the worst of the worst. A fin de si\xE8cle in every sense of the word.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> Cut off from the outside world, this city has become a prison\u2013a horrific cesspool of the unutterably vile.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> We call it Shinjuku, the Quarantined Territory of Malice!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Shinjuku...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Quarantined Territory of Malice...</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> It seems the time has come to reveal Shinjuku&#39;s first secret.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> It is nothing earth-shattering, but go on, see for yourself.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Is that...a wall? It&#39;s surrounding all of Shinjuku, just like the one that encircled Uruk!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> Right you are! It is a wall! And yes, it does indeed surround Shinjuku.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> So what&#39;s beyond the wall, you ask? Nobody knows! No transmissions come in, no transmissions go out.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I thought that everything burned down when humanity was incinerated.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AStaff B:</strong> We&#39;re currently unable to analyze anything but Shinjuku.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AStaff B:</strong> Sheba can barely make out the scattered remains of the wards that neighbor Shinjuku.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AStaff B:</strong> But otherwise, the outside of the wall appears to be the same as the periphery of the Singularities during the incineration.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Excuse me, but what&#39;s that tower over there to the west?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Tower...? ...Ah, that tower.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I don&#39;t remember that being there.</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hey, Servant-y person. Do you know what that is?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> Oh, that? I believe you will find that is the lair of the one who will be your nemesis here. But I&#39;m afraid you won&#39;t be getting there anytime soon.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> I&#39;m sure you understand that in stories such as ours, the path to the villain is circuitous at best.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So you mean the path cuts off before it reaches there? What about hopping along the rooftops?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> I&#39;m afraid that would make you easy pickings for the enemy Servants.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Servants!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Just who are you?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yes, I think it&#39;s about time you told us that.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> Mm-hm, I see.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> I suppose it would only be proper for me to tell you my True Name now.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> But remember this, young Master of Chaldea. Usually, a Servant must keep their True Name hidden.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> After all, revealing it would also mean revealing their weakness.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> The more invincible a renowned hero of myth seems, the more certain they are to have a weakness.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> Mythology, after all, does sometimes have its plot devices.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> Sometimes, the bigger the monster, the easier it is dispatched.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> Thus the custom among us Servants of calling each other by our class names in typical Holy Grail Wars.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> Though I am given to understand that there was no time for that sort of thing during the restoration of humanity.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> Of course, with any number of Masters urgently shouting\u201CArcher, attack! \u201D, \u201CArcher, heal! \u201D, and \u201CArcher, defend! \u201D...</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> ...One could be forgiven for getting a little confused.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> Nonetheless, in this Singularity, revealing one&#39;s True Name could well prove fatal.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> Are we clear on that, [\u2642 young man /\u2640 young lady]?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> As such, I can tell you my class name to facilitate easy communication.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> But I cannot yet reveal my True Name. I hope you will understand.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Understood.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> Ah, the perfect answer. Small wonder it was you who saved the world.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> So what&#39;s your class, then?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> Hahaha! You don&#39;t waste any time, do you? An admirable demonstration of your decisiveness.</p><hr><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> Very well then, I shall tell you my class name!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> I&#39;ll even be more specific to help make it a proper appellation!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> My class is...Archer! Here I am known, or so I&#39;m told, as \u201Cthe Archer of Shinjuku\u201D!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Of course, you may simply call me \u201CArcher\u201D if you&#39;re sure you won&#39;t find it confusing!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That is REALLY specific!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Ha ha ha! You said it, Fujimaru! Got a nice local feel to it!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I had my reservations about this name at first too, but I decided it was better than \u201CTokyo Archer\u201D!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> There&#39;s a certain...pomposity it would take to use such a prestigious city as my name, no?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> \u201CAnd here comes Tokyo Archer, the undisputed champion of the Holy Grail War for 13 years straight! \u201D</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> You know, that sort of thing.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> On the other hand, \u201CRoppongi Archer\u201D rather sounds like I work at a host club!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> At any rate, there you have it: I am the Archer of Shinjuku. At least, I believe so.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Don&#39;t you think that sounds a little like...</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Hmm?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Like the name of a Kabukicho host, you say?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Ha ha ha!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I cannot blame you for thinking so! This butterfly ensemble does seems to have been made with an eye to garnering female attention!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Not that I ever had any interest in or luck with women even when I was alive, of course.</p><hr><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> All right then, let us begin our trip into hell!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> An Archer class, huh? I would have guessed you were a Caster.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> You&#39;re a sharp one, aren&#39;t you.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Even my Spirit Origin wonders if I wasn&#39;t originally supposed to be a Caster.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Hmm, you know what, never mind that for the moment. I may seem otherwise, but I am most assuredly an Archer.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> And by 1999, you don&#39;t even need to wait around for Angolmois.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> If all the weapons of mass destruction scattered around the world were to activate, we&#39;d be done for.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Of course, it&#39;s usually the case that that doesn&#39;t happen. Theoretically, that&#39;s even how it should be.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Without something akin to divine intervention, destroying the world should have been an impossible dream.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> But now, the world&#39;s so small it can fit in the palm of your hand! That certainly simplifies matters!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Today, each and every one of us has the potential to destroy the world. How things change...</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Hm? Hmmm? ...Ah, my apologies. Listen to me, rambling on when we should focus!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hmm...Talks like a bad guy, dresses in modern-day clothing, looks like a Caster...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hmm...I&#39;m drawing a blank!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Ha ha ha, sorry about that!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> At any rate, Master of Chaldea, you may want to take a few steps back from where you&#39;re standing.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> What with the net and all.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Net?</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong> Damn, I missed!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Is that wire mesh or something?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master, I&#39;m picking up several hostile-looking entities. You need to get out of there immediately!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Now now, just hold your horses, young miss.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> This is an excellent opportunity to truly understand what&#39;s happened to Shinjuku.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> B-but\u2013</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I will, of course, assist. It is the very reason I saved the young Master here, after all.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Think of this as my audition of sorts.</p><p><strong>Ruffian A:</strong> Now we&#39;ve got &#39;em! ...Hey! Over here, guys!</p><p><strong>Ruffian B:</strong> What a [\u2642 handsome guy /\u2640 pretty lady]. I can&#39;t wait to mess [\u2642 him /\u2640 her] up!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Those are no run-of-the-mill ruffians...Are they enchanted!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> How can ordinary humans in 1999 do that!?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> An excellent question! The answer is that they are not, in fact, ordinary.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> They&#39;re spellcasters that have managed to survive this living hell!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Only the truly wicked can survive in Shinjuku as it is now! Anyone lacking that vicious virtue meets with oppression or death.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Order is long since gone. Chaos is all that remains!</p><p><strong>G\uFF1ARuffian A:</strong> Kill them! If their bodies are clean, the necromancer&#39;ll give us a good price for them!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Now then, Master of Chaldea!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Now that you are in this evil world awash with sin and bereft of punishment, what do you have to show me!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Join me first.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I have nothing to show you.</p><hr><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Of course!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Well then, this should certainly be...diverting!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> All right, Master, give me your orders!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Hm? Oh, don&#39;t misunderstand.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> You&#39;re a simple one, aren&#39;t you! No need to show me anything; all you have to do is what must be done.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I can enjoy the show all on my own accord!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You tell that Archer, Senpai!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai repaired all seven Singularities! [\u2642 He&#39;s /\u2640 She&#39;s] the greatest Master in the world!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Take it down a level, Mash.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> O-oh, sorry, Senpai. That just slipped out.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> All right, Mr. Archer of Shinjuku.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I have no doubt that Fujimaru&#39;s going to put on a great show for you. But, I know a better way to satisfy you.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Shall I tell you what that is?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Aha, no need for that. I understand perfectly. Very well, Master! Use me however you see fit!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I am the Archer of Shinjuku, Servant at large and master of magical bullets!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> All enemies defeated. Well done, Master!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hey, Mash, got a second?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What is it?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Do you have any idea what the Archer of Shinjuku&#39;s True Name might be?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No, I&#39;m afraid not.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Not only am I the world&#39;s most eminent artist, but I am also the world&#39;s foremost authority on Servants.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> And that one doesn&#39;t line up with anything I know.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Even if I narrow the scope to either Archers or Casters, there&#39;s always something off about him.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. I think so too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I get the feeling that he&#39;s not just hiding his name. He might even be disguising his class.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You too, huh?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Still, I can understand mistaking, say, a Saber for a Berserker...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But mistaking a Caster for an Archer? That seems seriously unlikely.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> And then there&#39;s his fighting style.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, I wondered about that too.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> An Archer who uses bullets? Naturally I&#39;ve got a few ideas, but he doesn&#39;t line up with any of them.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Hmm...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> At any rate, we should keep trying to find out who he is. But don&#39;t say anything about this to Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Understood. I&#39;ll continue to investigate his identity while this operation is underway.</p><p><strong>Ruffian A:</strong> D-damn it! You&#39;ll pay for this!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Talk about clich\xE9d!</p><hr><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> All done.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I must say, one truly feels one&#39;s years when being summoned at this age to fight in battle!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Weren&#39;t you summoned in your prime?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Hahaha! You&#39;ve got me there. I suppose this must be me in my prime!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I AM in excellent shape. And this weapon, this coffin, certainly makes it easy to hit whatever I happen to aim for.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Now is your prime? Are you certain?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You weren&#39;t summoned in your youth?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Nope! But, there&#39;s a reason for that. See, the thing is...</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Apparently, I&#39;ve never had a youthful moment.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No youthful moment...?</p><hr><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Right you are, young knight. I have no memory whatsoever of being young during my prime.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> In fact, ever since I got older my memory has been hazy and fragmented. It&#39;s really quite troubling.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Why was I fighting here, I wonder.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s what I want to know!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I suppose you would, wouldn&#39;t you! Hah hah!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> At any rate, I take it you now understand how truly awful this Shinjuku is?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> For justice?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Hah hah! Justice! Is that what you call this!?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Although...This feeling in my chest...Maybe it IS what you&#39;d call...justice.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Hmm...You really are a sharp one, aren&#39;t you! Perhaps a little too sharp!</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> So, Archer of Shinjuku, now that things have calmed down a bit, I was hoping we could have a chat.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Hmm, yes! I certainly understand!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> You want to know more about what&#39;s going on in Shinjuku here, don&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> And I&#39;m sure you especially want to know how it&#39;s unusual, and where history may have gone astray.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> ...Well, before we get to that, why don&#39;t we make a deal?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I will tell you the truth about this city. In return, you pay me accordingly.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Cash?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Credit?</p><hr><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Hmm, neither, really!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> What I want from you...is trust. I want to hear you say you trust me, and also act accordingly.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> In all my life, there is only one thing in which I&#39;ve trusted absolutely. And you are not it.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Do you think you can trust me?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m not sure yet.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Perfect!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I want to.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> So, it&#39;s not that you don&#39;t trust me...it&#39;s that you want to, eh.</p><hr><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Good.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> If you had agreed to trust me right away, I would have packed up and gone home immediately.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Not that I have a home to go to, of course!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That smug look is infuriating.</p><hr><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Now now! This is just how I look natur\u2013</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> ...Ahem.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> At any rate, neither of us trusts the other yet. But, I think there&#39;s one big thing we can agree on.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> We cannot permit Shinjuku to remain as it is.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Evil cannot be permitted to rampage unchecked. I think it&#39;s safe to say we&#39;re on the same page there?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> For now.</p><hr><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Delightful!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Then I shall do my utmost to earn your trust, and you may demonstrate what you&#39;re capable of.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> You commanded numerous Servants and triumphed over the seven Singularities, right? That must mean you&#39;re not only the last Master in the world, you&#39;re also the greatest! Now, that I must see for myself!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> \u2013Month X, Day Y Dant\xE8s&#39; Journal</p><p><strong>???:</strong> To be frank, good cannot survive here. Here, good is fragile and unreliable.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Cooperation is impossible.

Hello, Archer. And hello, Assassin.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> You should know that the barrier picked up a signal earlier.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> It seems that Chaldea has sent a Master here to restore humanity, just as we expected.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> I hacked the Rayshift coordinates to make [\u2642 him /\u2640 her] fall, but I&#39;m afraid it didn&#39;t go so well.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> So, what&#39;s our plan now?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/9QdxWyo.png" alt="3-light"></p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> Calm yourself, Rider. Not that I blame you for being enraged.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> ...Could we go after them?</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong> Hahaha. I just bet he&#39;s raring to go. To Rider, everyone&#39;s an enemy, including us.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong> He couldn&#39;t be more stoked about having an enemy he can just openly kill!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong> Besides, didn&#39;t you pretty much figure that&#39;d be his response to being told about Chaldea?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> Well, more or less.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong> So what exactly are you planning to do with this whole \u201Cleague\u201D thing?</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong> If it were me, I&#39;d just kill [\u2642 him /\u2640 her] before [\u2642 he /\u2640 she] could see it coming!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong> Wanna do that? Please? Hell, I&#39;ll do it if you like!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> What do you think, other Archer?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> You already know what I&#39;m going to say, Professor.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> Look inside yourself, and you&#39;ll know the best course of action.... Just tell me who to kill.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Yes, you do have a point.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I&#39;m certainly not the type to let another&#39;s opinion change my chosen course of action.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> At any rate, Chaldea is finally involved. I&#39;ve been waiting for this for thousands of years.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> ...No, I shouldn&#39;t let my personal feelings show. I&#39;ll have to keep them in check.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> In any case, I&#39;ve been expecting this. As such, I have a plan in place. First, Berserker will go on a rampage, then Rider will track [\u2642 him /\u2640 her] down.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> If [\u2642 he /\u2640 she] manages to survive even that, then it will be your turn, Assassin.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> You got it! Let&#39;s see, that would mean I go...third!? Aw man, why do I hafta start late?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> What about me?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I&#39;d like you to handle the flying squad. After all, you&#39;re my biggest miscalculation.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> Hmph, miscalculation, eh. Well that&#39;s nice.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> Now that I&#39;ve been summoned here,I know what I have to do.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> Sow chaos across the world, and rain evil down from the sky. Piece of cake, right?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Piece of cake, eh. You do realize this is very different from your previous position, right?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> Hey, you&#39;re lucky you got me. Make the most of it.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> After all, it didn&#39;t take you long to lose your Saber and Lancer. Even darkened, those Heroic Spirits never lost their pride.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> Getting two bad Servants right off the bat...You may be a master of calculation, but your luck is awful.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I make it a point not to count on something as unreliable as luck in my calculations.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> And from that moment on, you were my miscalculation.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> You were the one who killed that Saber and Lancer so quickly, after all. Not that I don&#39;t appreciate it.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> Don&#39;t worry about it. Consider it my sales pitch for my new master.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I had accounted for losing all three of my knights at worst.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Even having one of them survive is a win in my book.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> But, that does mean my initial calculations were way off. After all, you still haven&#39;t disposed of...it.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> So, Phantom Spirits are also brainwashing devices, eh.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> Nah, I don&#39;t think so! At least, I hope not! Maybe I should, though!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> But don&#39;t worry, Professor! Even if I am brainwashed,I&#39;ve still made it my mission to kill you!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I appreciate your honesty.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> At any rate, Phantom Spirits are nothing more than ability enhancers, much like a mage&#39;s Essences.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> Now I see. No wonder you&#39;re an Archer. He must never have stood a chance against your magical bullets.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> In which case, there is no need to transplant the Phantom Spirit. I have always been Nameless, and a botched transplant could also affect my Spirit Origin.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> But it&#39;s perfectly safe. I didn&#39;t spend 3,000 years developing it for nothing, you know.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> 3,000 years, eh. How patient of you.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Where are you going?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> With Chaldea here, the battle is certain to get more explosive.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> I thought I would double-check the sniper spot I picked out earlier before that happens.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Now I see. Good man. One can never be too careful, after all.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I wonder who it was who said that two plus two always equals four.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I&#39;m glad you&#39;re on my side, Emiya.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Normally I would thank you for the compliment, except I can&#39;t trust a thing you say.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> With all your lies and deceit, the only thing I know about you for sure is that you&#39;re evil.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> Geez, for a guy who looks like a dealer, he&#39;s sure got a stick up his butt!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> That may be, but he&#39;s still much easier to deal with than you, Assassin.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> After all, he&#39;s always calculating too, and with a fairly complex formula at that.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> The answer, however, is simple. Once you figure that out, you understand him, and the formula no longer confuses you.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Not that I&#39;ve figured it out in its entirety, of course. But in that sense, I find dealing with you to be far more troublesome.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> Me? Really?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> I mean, I know I&#39;m biased and all, but I feel like there ain&#39;t many guys as easy to understand as me!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> You meant it when you said you intend to kill me earlier, didn&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> You bet I did!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> ...Your formula is fairly simple, but the result is so bizarre I can&#39;t understand it.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> Is that a compliment?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Absolutely.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> I see, I see...In that case, thanks!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> I never did get many compliments when I was alive, especially from my master!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> ...That said, I don&#39;t believe your result will affect my final calculation.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I have my magical bullets. I have my Barrel.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Now I just need one yet-to-be-defined element, and my formula will be complete.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Um, excuse me.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Does that mean you&#39;re not going to let me out of here until this formula of yours is done?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Of course not, Mr. Shakespeare.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> But don&#39;t let it get you down. Even compared to other worlds, humanity here is far outside the norm.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Every one of the stories, characters, and monsters you write or have written about actually exists here.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Don&#39;t you feel honored that your work has such an impact?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Even if I am half-Alter, I can&#39;t say the prospect excites me.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> I mean, think about it.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> This is like a wondrous world of fantasy, fiction, and dreams somewhat separate from Shinjuku, right?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> And you excelled at the theater, as I recall, which is largely the same thing.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> The monsters that appear in my plays are only ever human.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Even Caliban from my own \u201CThe Tempest\u201D was nothing but a man in makeup.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Monsters are monstrous because they cannot be defined. The terror they elicit lies in being unable to see them.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Having actual monsters escape into reality would be nothing less than a nightmare!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> If I were my normal self I would recite some longwinded lines from my own works, but now that I&#39;ve been inverted, I won&#39;t stand for it!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> So if all I can do here is wail and repent, that is what I shall do!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> That&#39;s the only part of you affected by the inversion, eh? You must be quite the good Samaritan.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Not at all! I simply love the patterns that humans produce.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Even if my alignment is now inverted, that writer&#39;s instinct remains the same.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> As such, Professor, I don&#39;t believe you and I will ever reach an understanding!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> ...I see. Then I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ll continue to suffer in there. Fortunately for me, I never expected you to cooperate of your own free will.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> If anything, I expect you&#39;ll gladly betray me the moment something new strikes your fancy.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> ...You&#39;ve got me there.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> A little tip from an old criminal: the seeds of deception are best planted well in advance.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Oh, and while you&#39;re here, I&#39;d like you to keep mass-producing King Lears. They are quite useful.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Well, this is quite the fix.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> No sooner do I answer the summon than I find myself in the middle of purgatory.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> I didn&#39;t think I had done anything so terrible as to deserve this...But perhaps I have.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> \u201CWhen we are born, we cry that we are come to this great stage of fools. \u201D</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> ...Great. Now I&#39;ve gone and done something my usual self would do!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Now then, there are of course numerous other life-forms besides ruffians hiding in this Shinjuku.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> 1999 or not, you&#39;ll see all sorts of Demonic Beast-like creatures come out of the woodwork.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> There are yakuza who know magecraft...Rich people with Chimeras for pets...</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Mannequins that attack you...This city may well have more ghosts than people!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Is that a baby crying?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Look, a stroller!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Wild dogs are attacking it!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh no! You have to save it!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Huh? Wait a moment!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Go on, get!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master, you should take that baby somewhere safe.... Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s a doll...?</p><hr><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> What were you thinking, running off on your own like that!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> An explosion!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master! Are you okay!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m okay!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Well...I&#39;m alive at least.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, thank goodness.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Do try and be more careful, would you? My back just made a sound that backs should never make.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Sorry.</p><hr><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Yes, well, while I can certainly appreciate the desire to help others...</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> ...you cannot allow that desire to lead you by the nose. You must always be mindful of your surroundings.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Think about it. Why is there no guardian nearby? Why was the baby crying at set intervals?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> For that matter, what parent would be so reckless as to bring their baby outside to this Shinjuku?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> These are the sort of questions you need to be asking yourself as you examine your surroundings.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Remember, meaning follows us wherever we go\u2013not why we live, but why we are where we are.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Meaning in life can be added after the fact, but as of now, there is absolutely meaning in being here.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> You are here to repair the Singularity. I, most likely, am here to help you.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> There are others who are here to stop you as well. You will need to consider these meanings, and make a choice.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Got it? Now, stand up!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Y-yes sir!</p><hr><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Bow!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Bowing!</p><hr><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Be seated!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Nice try.</p><hr><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Drat, so you didn&#39;t fall for it. Very well then, back to the discussion at hand!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Think about that baby again. No matter how you look at it, that was no more than the bait for a trap.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> You do understand that, right?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Now, as we know it was a trap, we must ask ourselves who set it. Ah! Here we find the answer!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Be careful, Master. I&#39;m picking up eleven hostile signals near you!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Is that...a soprano? They&#39;re really good!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> It&#39;s the Coloraturas. Hide, quickly!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Colo-what?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What are they?</p><hr><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> They&#39;re mannequins controlled by Christine, the Puppet of the Opera. They sing while killing people.</p><p><strong>Citizen A:</strong> Oh god...Aaaaaah! Please, don&#39;t! ...Urk...gah...!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> By the time they leave, not even corpses remain. Perhaps they use dead bodies for material?</p><p><strong>Ruffian A:</strong> No...No! Save me!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I say, that&#39;s one of the ruffians from earlier.</p><p><strong>Ruffian A:</strong> Please...I don&#39;t want to die! Somebody, save meee!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> He&#39;s injured!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...!</p><hr><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Well now, you stood your ground! I admire your spirit.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Is that a trap too?</p><hr><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Yes, and I&#39;m afraid he&#39;s all but done for.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No, wait. I&#39;ve analyzed his wounds, and I don&#39;t believe they&#39;re fatal!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> That&#39;s not what I mean. The Coloraturas are trying to lure us in.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> There&#39;s no way he could escape with those kinds of injuries.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> The Coloraturas are far quicker than any Shinjuku rat. He only escaped because they let him.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> It&#39;s the same tactic employed by modern-day snipers. You needn&#39;t always kill your target, but rather neutralize the threat they pose.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Shoot their legs or stomach, and keep them alive.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> That&#39;s enough on its own, but when their allies then come to help them, you can wound or kill them as well and increase the carnage exponentially.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> In other words, if we try to help that ruffian...they&#39;ll be all over us.</p><p><strong>Ruffian A:</strong> Please...Somebody...Help me...</p><p><strong>Ruffian A:</strong> Gah!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Well done holding out, young Master. Normally, this is where we would make our retreat.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> But I can see that doesn&#39;t sit at all well with you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> No, it doesn&#39;t.</p><hr><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> In that case, we will begin by slowly, silently sneaking around them.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> The Coloraturas have frightfully good hearing. We must not make a sound.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Slowly, quietly, make your way around...</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> ......</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um...Mr. Archer...?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You just ruined the whole stealth approach you were advocating not too long ago.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Now now, that was not my fault! I blame all the trash scattered about the street.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Stop making excuses!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You always sound so sketchy!</p><hr><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Hahahaha! (Laughing to change the subject)</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I guess now that we&#39;ve been spotted, there&#39;s no turning back. Let&#39;s be about it then, you overgrown marionettes!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Here come the Coloraturas!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ninth Coloratura, defeated!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The remaining two are still keeping their distance. They are holding position. What shall we do, Master?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Master, I believe we should get ready to make our retreat.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> As such, Mash, I would like you to find the optimal escape route for us.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh? Are you saying...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...these last two are really tough?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Oh yes, very tough indeed.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Truth be told, they are far out of our league at this moment.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> In fact, to extend the analogy, you might say they&#39;re playing a different sport altogether.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Who are they?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Simple. A matriarch of sorts, who holds sway over these marionettes, and her loyal slave.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m analyzing your surroundings to find your optimal escape route. However, I&#39;m afraid the enemies are closing in quickly. Please try to hold out a little longer!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> In that case, perhaps we should try to speak with them to buy some time.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> By which I of course mean \u201Cmake excuses and beg for our lives\u201D!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Are you good at that sort of thing, Master?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Uhh...If by \u201Cgood\u201D you mean \u201Cabsolutely terrible,\u201D then sure.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> [\u2642 He /\u2640 She] may put [\u2642 his /\u2640 her] life on the line in everything [\u2642 he /\u2640 she] does, but [\u2642 he /\u2640 she]&#39;s never once begged for it.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> My my, that certainly is brave! Although...Seen in another light, it could be a kind of cowardice.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Begging for one&#39;s life is something humans do to forestall their deaths as long as they can.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> You mustn&#39;t deny that. One should only go gentle into that good night when one is certain it is their time.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Oh, but Fujimaru may be pretty good at buying time if you just let [\u2642 him /\u2640 her] keep talking!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I&#39;ll be sure to keep that in mind.... Here they come!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Spirit Origin analysis completed. It&#39;s the Phantom of the Opera.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Although, something about him seems...off?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> And then there&#39;s that other Servant...At least, I think it&#39;s a Servant? I can&#39;t tell for sure.</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong> Ahh, Christine...My shining jewel, my dearest light...</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong> What do you wish for, what do you desire?</p><p><strong>Christine:</strong> I&#39;m sane, I&#39;m not crazy, I&#39;m crazy, I&#39;m miasma. I&#39;m human, I&#39;m humanity, I&#39;m a puppet, I&#39;m a doll.</p><p><strong>Christine:</strong> Yes...I want life, I want vitality, I want blood, I want fresh blood.</p><p><strong>Christine:</strong> I want type A and type AB, I don&#39;t need type B, people need transfusions to live, to live as people, they need soapboxes.</p><p><strong>Christine:</strong> If one life is lost, I can move one space forward and become human.</p><p><strong>Christine:</strong> If two lives are lost, I can move one space forward and become human. So one and two are the same.</p><p><strong>Christine:</strong> Yes, please give me life.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Hahaha! We would seem to be out of luck. Christine is in quite a state today.</p><p><strong>Christine:</strong> Ahh...Ahh, aHh, ahH, AHH! Chaldea! Chaldea! You, Chaldea Master, savior of the world!</p><p><strong>Christine:</strong> Please give me your life, so that I may be saved too.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Aha! Now I see, Master. This is your fault!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Huh!?</p><hr><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Well, you did go and save the world, didn&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> If you can do that...</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> ...then surely you must also have some mysterious power to save that bit of scrap.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That&#39;s insane!</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong> What did you just say? What did you just call my beloved Christine?</p><p><strong>Christine:</strong> How dare you, I hate you. I&#39;ll kill you, I&#39;ll destroy you.</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong> Oh, Christine, my love! Your fury is even hotter and more beautiful than the sun!</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong> I shall kill them, yes, I shall destroy them! I&#39;ll tear them both limb from limb and assemble them anew! That will help them think about what they&#39;ve done!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Hahaha! Not a day goes by that I don&#39;t think about that! My conclusion? I&#39;m complete! I&#39;m perfect! I&#39;m an intellectual!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> How intelligent, you ask? Enough to stall for the precise amount of time we need!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Mash!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I&#39;ve found your optimal escape route! Follow my instructions and get out of there, Master!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Excellent! Then here&#39;s my last bit of stalling!</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong> Why, it&#39;s those magical bullets! So your means ARE the same, even if your ends are polar opposites!</p><p><strong>Christine:</strong> Missed, missed, you missed, you missed.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Not at all! Here comes the BOOM!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> ...Hahaha! I have always wanted to say that!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Th-the gas station just blew up! Quick, now&#39;s your chance!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Very well!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> That was indeed a perfect getaway.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The Phantom and Christine are right on\u2014Oh, take a right there, Senpai!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Just a moment, Mash! Isn&#39;t this a...what do you call it...a highway?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Uh, yes! It&#39;s Japan National Route 20!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I see. I&#39;m afraid that with all that&#39;s happened, there are a few things I may have forgotten to mention.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Firstly, I apologize for that oversight.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Secondly, I really should have told you this right away, but...</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> It seems the many Servants who have turned to evil here have agreed to divide and conquer, as it were.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Which means...?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> This highway, as you called it, is now their territory!</p><h2 id="section-3-road-raging-monster" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3-road-raging-monster" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 3: Road Raging Monster</h2><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...There is an unwritten rule here in Shinjuku about what to do when that terrible howl rings out.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> If the howl is far away, you&#39;re safe. If it&#39;s close, you run away.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> It doesn&#39;t matter if you are fighting for your life, mugging an innocent, or are being mugged yourself.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> When you hear its howl nearby, you drop whatever you are doing and flee as fast as you can.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> As far as unwritten rules go, this one is absolute.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Uh oh, it&#39;s closer than I thought! Run!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Hm, I guess that&#39;s too much to ask. Okay, I&#39;ll carry you so you can focus on the transmission! Come on!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I-I&#39;ve just picked up an enormous Spirit Origin reading out of nowhere!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> And...it&#39;s headed straight for you, Master!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It will arrive at your position in less than five...no, three minutes!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I knew it! You&#39;re the one the wolf is after!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Wolf!? You mean this thing coming towards you at...two hundred kilometers per hour!?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Well, that is if you can still call a monster capable of tracking its prey at while running at two hundred kilometers per hour an animal!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> This is bad. He&#39;ll catch us at this rate!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Then we&#39;ll just have to fight!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I suppose you&#39;re right. Okay, team up with the Archer of Shinjuku and get ready to meet it head-on!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Mash!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, Master! If you mean to meet it head-on, I&#39;ll do everything I can to back you up from here!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Please...be careful!</p><hr><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> You can feel your soul shudder every time you hear it, right? That&#39;s fear at work.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> It&#39;s an extremely unusual kind of Servant, you see.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Most Servants cannot exist if they are purely fiction. Their origins are rooted in myths and legends that have some kernel of true existence to them.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> There must be a powerful reason to exist on fiction alone.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> For example...the embodiment of a wish to keep one&#39;s children safe. Like a picture book.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Do you have any Servants like that on hand?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> There&#39;s one who likes to go for a spin.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I see. Fascinating. I would love to meet them for myself at some point.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;m afraid not.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I see. Well, if you ever summon one, I hope you&#39;ll let me meet them.</p><hr><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Master, the wolf we&#39;re about to come in contact with is entirely fiction; it has no reason to exist.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> In other words, it is not a Heroic Spirit, which in turn means that it cannot be a Servant.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> At least, under normal circumstances.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Fictions whose Spirit Origin values fail to suffice. Concepts that never go beyond mere urban legend. Beings who simply wither and disappear, failing to become either Heroes or Anti-Heroes.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> We call them Phantom Spirits.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Phantom Spirits...Didn&#39;t Mr. Holmes mention those once?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Mmm, true, there is much mystery surrounding Chaldea. But there are others I must chase right now.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Namely, the Phantom Spirit who...No, I must not discuss this here. If you&#39;ll excuse me, [\u2642 Mr. /\u2640 Ms. ] Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> What&#39;s more, these Phantom Spirits are extraordinarily peculiar!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> They&#39;re able to be summoned as a set, you see\u2013a mythical pair of twins, for instance, or a hero accompanied by their partner!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> However! As remarkable as such a summoning may be, surely it is still unthinkable that two beings who had absolutely no connection in life could be summoned together, right!?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> And yet, that&#39;s exactly what happened!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What the...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Its head is...gone!?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> That&#39;s right. It&#39;s a headless knight. In Ireland, these creatures are known as Dullahans.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> It is rather like something out of a fairy tale, no? But, well, it is every bit as cruel as the stories, and the wolf is no better.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> A giant wolf...!?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Indeed. The perfect mount for a headless knight. I&#39;m still not sure which myth the wolf is from, if any. But, it is just as cruel as the wolves from the myths.</p><hr><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> That much I do know.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s a human...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> A human arm!</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/cUedQZ5.png" alt="4-light"></p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Hahaha! I see you&#39;re as much of a glutton as ever!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A headless knight...and a wolf that eats people...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> And we don&#39;t know either of their True Names.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hmmm...A headless knight we have no Servant record for, but who could become one at some point...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...and a famous, man-eating wolf who couldn&#39;t become a Heroic Spirit...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Bah! I&#39;ve got nothing! There&#39;re just too many possibilities!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> We should be able to figure out the headless rider soon, but there must be hundreds of different wolves of myth!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> So let&#39;s save that for later!</p><p><strong>???:</strong></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/cUedQZ5.png" alt="4-light"></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Here they come!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Let&#39;s do this, Archer!</p><hr><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Heh! I like your spirit!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> That was just the call to action I needed! I must say, it&#39;s rather nice having a Master!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Come, Rider!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Ha ha ha! My apologies, but I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m completely outclassed.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You don&#39;t say!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I would welcome a deus ex machina just now, were such things real!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I could tell!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I bet you could!</p><hr><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> By the way, Master, on a completely different subject...Do you know how to drive?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Uh...</p><hr><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Well, whether you can or not, I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ll have to.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Da Vinci! I presume you can teach the young Master here how to drive in real time?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hmm, probably! Why, what have you got in mind?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Why, stalling for time, of course! Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll be fine! Let&#39;s reconvene at Shinjuku Station!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Temporary contract or not, I am still your Servant for the moment! I have no plans to allow myself to die!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Now...bring it!</p><p><strong>Rider of Shinjuku:</strong></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/cUedQZ5.png" alt="4-light"></p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Ngh!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Is this...a smoke screen!?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Huh!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> A Servant!?</p><p><strong>Rider of Shinjuku:</strong></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/9QdxWyo.png" alt="3-light"></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> And there&#39;s another one headed your way, fast!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Visual confirmation in five, four, three...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> THAT WAS SO COOL!</p><hr><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> I&#39;m impressed you have found a way to survive out here, Master of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> But I suppose we can discuss that later.

Come on!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> ...All right. Take care of [\u2642 him /\u2640 her]!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Now, I&#39;d better find a way to make my own escape!</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Cunning as he may be, my identity should still be safe since I&#39;ve managed to stay hidden. However...</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> I still cannot quite understand what his goal must be in siding with Chaldea. Not to mention that last act of his...</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> No, that&#39;s not possible. He is fundamentally at odds with order. There&#39;s not a selfless bone in his body.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> It must be some sort of plot. I&#39;m certain he has ulterior motives guiding his every move.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> And yet...I cannot see any meaning to his actions beyond a Servant defending his Master.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> This won&#39;t do. I always get too worked up when it comes to him.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> There&#39;s also the question of...No, never mind. [\u2642 He /\u2640 She] should be fine with her.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Now, we only need one more Servant to join Chaldea&#39;s side.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Of course, she is fairly twisted, but I can&#39;t let that stop me from paying her a visit.</p><h2 id="section-4-shinjuku-labyrinth" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4-shinjuku-labyrinth" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 4: Shinjuku Labyrinth</h2><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Ohgodohgodohgod!!!

Hm? You say we have?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> That was most likely a different me.

And raw, no less?</p><hr><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Oh, very well. Come with us, Cavall II.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> There should be some dog food at the roost.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Did I hear that name right?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Does the name Cavall II displease you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Is this your dog?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Of course not.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> He simply follows me around, so I&#39;m left with no choice but to occasionally feed him leftovers.</p><hr><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Now, follow me, Master! You too, Cavall II!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So there are roosts in the basements of hamburger restaurants...I&#39;ll have to remember that.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hahaha, don&#39;t bother.

From an artist&#39;s perspective, anyway.</p><hr><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> No, that is not what I mean.

He was a fierce opponent, with untold magical energy reserves far beyond my own.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> And yet, Fujimaru, the Archer of Shinjuku I fought was not the mysterious yet good-humored man you describe.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> He was completely and utterly bland.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> His weapon, the way he wielded it...Everything about him was cold, calculated.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> He had a firm gasp of the battlefield, used his subordinates to trap me, and attempted to eliminate every unknown factor.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Did you say...subordinates?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> I did.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> At the very least, he is not the sort of Servant who would risk his own life to save his Master.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Perhaps he put one over on you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> No way! He couldn&#39;t have!</p><hr><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...Well, no matter. This Shinjuku has no shortage of mysteries.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Putting aside whether the Archer of Shinjuku is a traitor, let me tell you something else.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> The Archer of Shinjuku you encountered, and the Rider of Shinjuku you fought against...</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...are both part of a four-Servant alliance that rules all of Shinjuku.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> The League of Phantom Fiends.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> My guess is that this \u201Cleague\u201D is why you were sent here, as well as the source of the Singularity.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The League of Phantom Fiends...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Four Servants, hm? Do you know who the other two are?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> I was trying to find out when I encountered another Servant.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AAltria Alter:</strong> \u201CMy name is Edmond Dant\xE8s.

It IS him, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The one we met during that nightmare...</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> During a nightmare...Hm, that is quite the chance encounter.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> What else did Mr. Count of Monte Cristo have to say?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Oh, only that he had other matters to attend to.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> I should also mention that he seemed to be far too weak to handle the dangers of Shinjuku on his own.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The Count of Monte Cristo, weak...? That doesn&#39;t sound like him.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Maybe he had his power sapped by something. There&#39;s still so much we don&#39;t know.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> At any rate, I get that we need to beat this Phantom League or whatever, yes...</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> But to make that happen, we&#39;ll need a proper plan, and more fighters on our side.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...You&#39;re meeting back up with the Archer of Shinjuku, correct? Shall we get moving?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> I must see him again. Depending on the circumstances, we may even have to cross swords again.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Please try to keep it peaceful...</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> I understand. But I hope you also understand your situation here, Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It won&#39;t come to that. Don&#39;t worry.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Fujimaru...You really are far too trusting.</p><hr><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Shinjuku as it is now is a city of lies. The ones you love may kill you; those you hate may save you.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> All in service of survival.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Hellish though this Singularity may be, when it comes to that, both human and Servant alike are desperate.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> As such...there is no guarantee that he will not betray you.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> But never mind that. Where are you supposed to meet him?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> It&#39;s getting late today. You should spend the night here; we&#39;ll head out to meet the Archer tomorrow.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Oh, one thing...</p><hr><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Hm?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I believe you agreed to meet at Shinjuku Station, didn&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Shinjuku Station? That hardly narrows it down.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Doesn&#39;t Shinjuku Station mean...Shinjuku Station?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...Ohhh. Now I understand.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Come to think of it, he did only say \u201CShinjuku Station. \u201D</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh? What are you talking about, Da Vinci?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> What would you like to do, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Let&#39;s start with the most famous meeting spot.</p><hr><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...This is going to take forever, isn&#39;t it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai, please tell me what all this talk about Shinjuku Station means.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Let&#39;s just say it&#39;s big.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It&#39;s a maze.</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Shinjuku Station isn&#39;t just really big, it&#39;s practically a labyrinth.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Big?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> On a typical day, it averaged no fewer than 3. 6 million passengers.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> 3. 6 million!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> On top of that, it kept adding expansion after expansion, making it almost impossible to navigate! And that&#39;s even with a map!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> And since the east and west exits aren&#39;t connected, going out the wrong one means starting over again!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Before you know it, you&#39;ve arrived at a station on a different line and then have to double back!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> If you go up the stairs to try and catch your breath, you find yourself at the bus terminal!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> If you try to read directions in an app, it&#39;ll have you follow a route straight through a store wall!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Now, pop quiz: where in this station should Fujimaru go in order to meet up with the Archer of Shinjuku?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I-I see your point.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Even if we can detect Servants, it would be hard to navigate a maze like that.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> And it&#39;s not like the station is free of enemies. Though I&#39;m sure that&#39;s in part to avoid ambushes.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Still, we don&#39;t have any choice but to go. We&#39;ll try to narrow down Archer&#39;s location as much as we can.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I&#39;ll handle the adjustments. Mash needs a break, and I think you could use some sleep too, Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Understood. You&#39;re going to turn in for the day now too, right, Senpai?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Good night, Mash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You too, Senpai. Please get a good night&#39;s sleep.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Well, as good as you can on a hard floor...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Where am I supposed to sleep?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hahaha, sleeping on a hard floor builds character! I&#39;ve lost count of how many times I&#39;ve done it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That doesn&#39;t count! You were just working on your inventions until you couldn&#39;t stay awake anymore.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Well, I guess you could put it that way...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Anyway, good night, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I really hope you have sweet dreams.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> So, you were unable to take down the target.</p><p><strong>Rider of Shinjuku:</strong></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/9QdxWyo.png" alt="3-light"></p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Oh, sorry. I wasn&#39;t criticizing you.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> If anything, I expected this. [\u2642 He /\u2640 She] is Chaldea&#39;s last Master, after all.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Not only did [\u2642 he /\u2640 she] face the Incineration of Humanity alone, [\u2642 he /\u2640 she] defeated Goetia by [\u2642 himself /\u2640 herself]...and even lived to tell the tale.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> [\u2642 He&#39;s /\u2640 She&#39;s] the most powerful Master there is.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> If a sneak attack or two was all it took to kill [\u2642 him /\u2640 her], [\u2642 he /\u2640 she]would have been dead long ago.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Perhaps [\u2642 he /\u2640 she] has nine lives, or a guardian spirit watching over [\u2642 him /\u2640 her], or is just extremely lucky.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> But that&#39;s not all. You know this too, Rider.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> We are the losing side.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Good always wins. We are destined to be defeated.</p><p><strong>Rider of Shinjuku:</strong></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/9QdxWyo.png" alt="3-light"></p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> But matters are different here in Shinjuku. Here, we turn the tables.... They said they were going to Shinjuku Station, right?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I&#39;ll send my personal guard to greet them. Go blow off some steam.</p><p><strong>Rider of Shinjuku:</strong></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/cUedQZ5.png" alt="4-light"></p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Good morning, Senpai. Did you sleep we\u2013Uh, never mind.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> My back hurts.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yeah, concrete will do that.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Good thing I packed you some of my special handmade pain-relieving compresses. Feel free to use one.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;m so sore.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Don&#39;t worry, Senpai. Once you get back, I&#39;ll massage you myself!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Sit.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Shake.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Good dog!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Another job well done, Cavall II.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Did you have your morning burger, Master? ...Then let&#39;s get going to Shinjuku Station.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> You seem confused about something. What is it? ...Ahh, now I see.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Yes, it&#39;s always night in this version of Shinjuku. Everyone here has forgotten what sunlight looks like.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Oh, and as for Shinjuku Station...Well, that may come as a surprise to you, too.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Cavall II, you stay here and keep an eye on things. And no going out on your own this time, okay?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It really IS a labyrinth!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What is this place?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Wow, Da Vinci, you weren&#39;t kidding!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Wait, wait.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> When I said it was a labyrinth, I didn&#39;t mean an actual labyrinth. What in the world is going on here?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> I don&#39;t know. It may be the work of a Servant, or perhaps it simply became like this over time.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> At any rate, watch your step. All these changes mean that this Shinjuku Station has fewer exits than it should.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Lose your way within, and you will be doomed to wander its halls until you die. Now, this way.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...That&#39;s strange.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What is it, Altria?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> The ruffians who usually inhabit the station are nowhere to be seen.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Of course, that in itself is not unusual.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> But it is strange that their campsite is completely gone from this passageway.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You sure you&#39;re not just mistaking it for another part of the station?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> No, somebody&#39;s been living here.</p><hr><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> I see you have a nose like a reindeer.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> They&#39;re easy to miss if you don&#39;t pay attention, but there are indeed signs that someone has lived here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Maybe the Archer of Shinjuku already fought them off?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Then why would he need to clean up afterwards?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Indeed.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> The only reason to clean up would be to hide whatever it was that took place here.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Master. Hypothetically speaking...</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> If you came here alone and found an empty campsite, shell casings, and blood...what would you think?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;d be on my guard.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;d run away.</p><hr><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Indeed. Which is exactly what whoever did this didn&#39;t want you to do.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Their mistake was in not accounting for a companion who is familiar with this labyrinth.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Especially not one who remembers that there used to be an unremarkable campsite here.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...It seems we&#39;ve been spotted.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Most likely, they planned to take their time and surround you before taking you out. As such, they wouldn&#39;t have been expecting a surprise attack like this.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> There is sure to be a weakness in their defense. Find it and hit it hard, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Got it!</p><hr><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> That should do it. Thank you for the instructions, Master.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> You, uh...You did very well.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Thanks to fighting alongside everyone.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yeah, that&#39;s true. You&#39;ve definitely become a first-rate Master.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You&#39;re aware, of course, that you have my genius to thank for it, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Da Vinci, can you please just focus on the analysis?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I just hope I&#39;m being useful.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai\u2013I mean, Master\u2013there has never been a single situation where you haven&#39;t been useful.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I would never have been able to fight for that long if it wasn&#39;t for you.</p><hr><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong> Hahaha! Even with a station as big as this...</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong> I figured you would notice if I got into a fight with the enemy. And I was right!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong> Now, if you don&#39;t mind, there really are quite a lot of them, so I would appreciate your help, Master!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> So, he&#39;s seen us. And I now understand why he only told you to meet here at Shinjuku Station.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Indeed.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A-at any rate, Archer&#39;s in the middle of a battle! Let&#39;s hurry!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Come, my coffin!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Hahaha! I would appear to be nearly out of bullets.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Come to think of it, how does this thing reload anyway?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Well, never mind that! The enemy is still here in force! And by my calculations...I win.</p><p><strong>Hornet:</strong> Huh!?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> We made it, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Thank goodness.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Be thankful for my sword.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Are you all right!?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Ah, there you are, Master! I haven&#39;t seen you in so long! More than, uh...twelve hours, by my count!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m not sure that qualifies as a long time.</p><hr><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Be that as it may, I&#39;m glad you made it.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> And you must be the knight who helped Master escape on that motorcycle.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> For that, you have my utmost gratitude.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (He&#39;s acting like he&#39;s never met her before, Master. )</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> My, so you saw who I was even amidst all that chaos. No wonder you are called the Archer of Shinjuku.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> ...I&#39;m sorry, what are you playing at here? Not that I really need to ask!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> So you ARE the man I fought back then. I knew it.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Who are you? What is your True Name, and what is your Noble Phantasm?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Your every action drips with deceit. And yet, there are also times when your true self shines through.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Your attempt to keep Fujimaru safe back then was one such time. Of that, I am certain.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> As you know, we have not established formal contracts with Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> We are simply working together out of happenstance and shared interest. [\u2642 He /\u2640 She] has not yet reached a point where [\u2642 he /\u2640 she] can serve as an anchor for us to manifest in this world.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Thus, there was no reason to defend [\u2642 him /\u2640 her] back then. Your fear of death was sincere.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> The Rider of Shinjuku is more Berserker than Rider. Stand before him, and your death is assured. Run away, and you may just manage to escape with your life.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> The Incineration of Humanity is over. Fujimaru dying would have no effect on the world at large.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> So why did you save [\u2642 him /\u2640 her]?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> To be honest, I am really not quite sure. My body seemed to move almost entirely on its own.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Of course, now that you mention it, you are correct! It makes not a lick of sense!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Why DID I move to protect [\u2642 him /\u2640 her]? I could certainly not abide a meaningless death for myself.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Why do you think I did it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> How should I know?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Good point!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Because you&#39;re a hero...?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Hahaha, good one! ...Wait, you were serious?</p><hr><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Then let me ask you: what is your relation to the Archer of Shinjuku with whom I fought?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> ...So you managed to fight him and survive. Impressive.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Thanks to outside interference.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> I understand that you are not the one I fought. However, I&#39;m also certain you are related somehow.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Now tell me. Who are you?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I...I suppose you could call me a clone. Or perhaps, something more akin to a waste product.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I may look just like him, but my True Name has been stolen, and I&#39;ve been stripped of most of my power.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Your True Name stolen...So is this like a split-into-good-and-evil kind of deal?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Hm?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> ...Oh, I see what you mean now. I suppose that would make me the good one.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m sure you are.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I hope you are.</p><hr><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Now I see...All right, let me sum up.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I was a villain, but I still had some remnants of a conscience occasionally complicating matters, so in order to become the perfect, ultimate villain, I divested myself of my good side.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Seen that way, the evil side of me must be exceptionally powerful.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Now that you mention it, your Spirit Origin does seem to be incomplete.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But on the other hand, if you could complete it, you might be able to take back your True Name!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Er, emphasis on \u201Cmight,\u201D that is.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> My True Name...Right, my True Name.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> As I am still able to deploy my Noble Phantasm\u2013albeit to a lesser extent\u2013I thought it did not matter that I had forgotten my True Name.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> But, I believe I would indeed be better off if I reclaimed it.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> I&#39;ve never seen anyone so happy about forgetting their name. You must be quite the blackguard.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Hm?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Hang on a moment. Didn&#39;t you say something about it not being safe to reveal your True Name before?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Hahahaha!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I was bluffing.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Bluffing.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Think about it, young [\u2642 man /\u2640 lady]. How would you respond if I&#39;d said, \u201CSorry, I don&#39;t actually know who I am myself! \u201D?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s shady.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Indeed. Clearly, I made the correct decision.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That&#39;s fishy.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Fishy!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I&#39;m not sure why you&#39;re so shocked. You&#39;ve been fishy ever since we first met.</p><hr><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> At any rate, we have successfully rendezvoused. Now we should leave while we still can.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Well, Master, it seems I now have a goal of my own.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Yes, I shall seek my own name, repair my Spirit Origin, and serve you with even greater power.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Would you be willing to shake on this as well?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Gladly.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (Extend hand without a word)</p><hr><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Thank you, my Master.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Ahhh, this is grand! I feel like celebrating!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> That is quite enough out of you. Stop it now, or I&#39;ll cut you down with my sacred sword.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Oh, yes, my apologies. Altria Alter, was it?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...Hold it. How do you know my True Name!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hey, yeah. Nobody ever mentioned her name!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Hm?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> It was the only logical conclusion. My apologies. Were you trying to keep it a secret from me?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> One thing I seem not to have forgotten about myself is that I&#39;ve never been good at holding my tongue!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Answer the question.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Very well, shall we start at the beginning? Grand. Firstly, your sword was something of a giveaway as to your being a Saber.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> However, It is theoretically possible that you could have been a Rider or Berserker...</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> But the odds of a Rider using a motorcycle for a mount seem vanishingly small.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Of course, the motorcycle could have been your Noble Phantasm, but then it would hardly make sense for you to fight with that sword.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> And given your finesse while mounted, and your eloquence, we can safely rule out the possibility of you being a Berserker.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> The fact that you fought my other self and survived also indicates that you are a highly skilled Saber.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> However, your apparent age is something of an anomaly for a Saber.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Generally, such a Servant would be summoned in her twenties\u2013her prime.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> And yet you look a deal younger than that. Unnaturally young, one might say.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> This could only mean that at some point in your life, before you became a hero, you ceased aging.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> You speak standard English without an accent. However, such knowledge would have been given to you by the Throne of Heroes, so this is hardly helpful.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> That you are a woman is something of a complication. There are, after all, few female knights who made a lasting name in history. Of course, magecraft would enable you to disguise yourself as male.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Unfortunately, of the small number of female knights who did leave their mark on history, most would appear a bit older when summoned than you do now.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Jeanne d&#39;Arc was an exception, beginning at seventeen and dying at nineteen...</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> But she was an amateur with the sword\u2013something which you clearly are not.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> And so I was forced to assume that you were believed to be a man by those who came after you to record your legend.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> There is also your brazen attitude and kingly mien that you&#39;ve demonstrated since we met.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> When we take this alongside what we already know\u2013namely that you are a famous, ageless male knight of Western lore\u2013the answer was quite simple.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> For the sake of discussion, let us say that you were Arthur Pendragon. That would certainly explain your royal bearing and comportment.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> But even if you were once known as Arthur, it is very unlikely to be your True Name.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> So we arrive at Altria, a corruption of the feminine form of Artorius. And if there was ever a Saber who could be called corrupted, it would be you, would it not?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> And one last thing. Her blade positively oozes malevolent energy, and yet she referred to it as a sacred sword.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> As such, the only sensible conclusion is that she was somehow inverted...In other words, an Alter.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> After all, were that not the case, it would be far too difficult to survive in this hellish world.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Even for one as pure and wholesome as King Arthur himself.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> This makes it all but a foregone conclusion that she is, in fact, an Alter.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> And, well, I if I am wrong about all of this, that is all right. I don&#39;t mind looking the fool.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Of course, if I am correct, you will all surely stand in awe of my deductive skills!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> And so you see the process that led me to deduce your identity. How did I do?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Well...you&#39;re not wrong.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I can&#39;t believe you got all that from her appearance and her saying \u201Csacred sword\u201D that one time.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um, Archer...Are you a detective, by any chance?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Hm.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yeah, that would make sense.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I know, right!? He was like Sherlock Holmes just now!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Hmm...A detective...No, I don&#39;t think I am.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> If anything, I find that to be the most loathsome profession in the world!</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> A detective...Yes, that profession would certainly suit him.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> With his observational skills and deductive reasoning, he could play detective all day.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> However, Mash Kyrielight...</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> It is because he used that skill and reasoning for evil that he stands before you as a Servant now.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> ...I knew there were two of them, but I didn&#39;t think they were split into good and evil.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> I&#39;m surprised he had even a modicum of anything that one could call a conscience.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> At any rate, if this is the case, the problem is even thornier than I thought.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> That building&#39;s form is already fairly visible. I believe I know its role as well.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> The problem comes down to the following three points: Where does the ammunition come from?</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Is it even possible? And why would he do that?</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> In a sense, I&#39;m impressed there is still so much I can&#39;t see even after coming all this way, Archer.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> What exactly are you up to? The more I learn, the more questions arise.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> You may have likened yourself to a butterfly, but you seem more like a spider to me.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Could that book be here in this city? ...Yes. It could be. Then I believe it&#39;s worth pursuing.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Come to think of it, do you like dogs, Archer?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Dogs? Well, I don&#39;t think I particularly mind them.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Well done guarding the roost, Cavall II.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Want some dog food?</p><hr><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Oho, I didn&#39;t think there were any friendly dogs left in Shinjuku.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Good dog, Cavall II. Now shake.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...He just turned away.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Um, here Cavall, want some dog food? It&#39;s really good.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> He knocked the food down!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Am I imagining things, or does this dog think it&#39;s better than me!?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (Altria&#39;s desperately pinching herself to try and hide her laughter! )</p><h2 id="section-5-black-maiden-fire-wheel" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-5-black-maiden-fire-wheel" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 5: Black Maiden Fire Wheel</h2><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Wake up, Master. We have an emergency.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Is that a phone?</p><hr><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> It just started ringing all of a sudden.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Any ideas who it might be? Perhaps you were cut off from Chaldea?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No, our connection is still stable.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Besides a PHONE wouldn&#39;t exactly be our method of getting back in touch if we were cut off.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> So, um...Who&#39;s going to answer it?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> [\u2642 He /\u2640 She] will.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Of course it&#39;s me.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A-are you okay with this, Senpai? Please don&#39;t get dragged into the phone, all right?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Oh, even in Shinjuku, I doubt that will happen! At least, I&#39;m pretty sure it won&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Anyway, go on and pick it up.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I&#39;ve never heard of anyone being dragged inside a phone before.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Hello.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Talk to me.</p><hr><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Good, you picked up just as I expected.

There&#39;s no need to lie.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> I&#39;m calling with information for you. How you use it...IF you use it is up to you.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> I just saw some soldiers from the League of Phantom Fiends on the move. They were led by a Servant named Emiya.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> They are headed for the altered Jeanne d&#39;Arc&#39;s hideout.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> She has remained neutral since she was summoned. She neither helps the weak, nor bows to the strong.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> She simply sticks to her territory and roasts any who dare to trespass.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> However, these soldiers are heavily armed. The only logical conclusion is that they are planning to kill her before she can join you.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> That said, this Jeanne is a dragon witch I once made an enemy of. I can&#39;t guarantee she is trustworthy.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Do you plan to go and help her anyway?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Of course!</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> ...I expected you would say as much.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Nonetheless, hearing it for myself makes it clear: you are truly Chaldea&#39;s finest Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Where&#39;s her hideout?</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Heh, calm yourself, Fujimaru.

And you may want to hurry.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Who was it?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> What did they say?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Well...</p><hr><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...I see.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> So Jeanne has gone and claimed her own territory without any regard for others?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> What kind of Alter does she think she is?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> I think I&#39;ll tie her to the back of Cuirassier Alter and take her for a ride around the Metro Expressway.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s awful.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Hmm, I don&#39;t think we should go help her.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Oh? Why&#39;s that?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Bluntly, she&#39;s quite mad.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I tried sneaking into her territory once. She merely said \u201CRepent, die, etcetera\u201D and hit me with wave after wave of explosive flame!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> It was like being attacked by a living inferno!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> She&#39;s a dragon witch!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s terrible she would do that to a poor, innocent old man!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> She had the right idea. Now let&#39;s go save her.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Were you listening to a word I said!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I like her already. Now let&#39;s go save her.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Not to worry, Archer of Shinjuku. I probably would have done the same.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> How is that supposed to make me feel better!?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> All right, I&#39;ll plot the fastest possible route from here to the park.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Go ahead and get ready, and we&#39;ll leave as soon as we can!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Hold down the fort while we&#39;re gone.</p><hr><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> ...Yah!</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A???:</strong> Haaa!</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> ...Whew.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A???:</strong> Ngh!</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Tch, finally landed a hit.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> A human fortress altered into a human tank, eh. Or perhaps \u201Caircraft carrier\u201D would be more accurate?</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> For all your toughness and firepower, it seems all you can do is flail around.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Now don&#39;t you feel like a silly country girl,Jeanne d&#39;Arc Alter?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Why you...! What kind of Servant are you, using a modern-looking gun!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Only a Gunner like Billy the Kid could even think about getting away with something like that!</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> There are exceptions to every rule.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Some of us just like to customize the hell out of our weapons.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Every Servant knows swords are stronger than guns. But like many things, it depends how they&#39;re used.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Now I see. That used to be a sword before you twisted it into a hideous gun! Freak!</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Right you are. Now then, dragon witch.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> As Shakespeare&#39;s Hamlet once said,\u201CTo be, or not to be. \u201D Which would you prefer?</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Not that it matters, I suppose...since you&#39;ll suffer a painful death either way.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> I believe killing someone begging for their life is a specialty of yours, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> You want an answer? Fine, here it is.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> You messed with the wrong woman, you little shit. I&#39;ll burn you to cinders!!!</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> My my.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...Dragon&#39;s Roar!</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Huh!?</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> She didn&#39;t...!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Bwahahahaha! If I die here, I&#39;m taking you with me!!!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Are you so dense that you can&#39;t even figure that out, stujerk!? (Short version of \u201Cstupid jerk\u201D)</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> You&#39;d blow yourself up!? Grr, you&#39;re as hardheaded and shortsighted as your original self!</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Can I make it...!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Time for you to burn up and disappear!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> La Grondement Du Haine!</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> I can feel the heat all the way out here. No wonder this flame was capable of burning her to death.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Or at least, that&#39;s how she imagines it.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> She&#39;s a fake; she doesn&#39;t actually know what the flames were like. She&#39;s simply recreating what she thinks it was like to the best of her ability.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> What a waste. She would have been useful.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> I could have used her one-track mind to sic her on targets like a mad dog.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Well, no matter. Explosive firepower like that would only complicate matters.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> I suppose it&#39;s just as well she&#39;s gone now.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> (Cough, hack! )(Gasp, gasp...)</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> That bastard! He used his shield at the last second to deflect the flames and escape!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Well, he&#39;s not getting away with it! Next time, I&#39;ll kill him...for...good.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Oh, great. I can&#39;t move another step.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Well, so what. I&#39;d much rather die like a dog than burn at the stake.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...Maybe someone will rob me of all my belongings and dump me in the river...Maybe I&#39;ll disappear while they&#39;re treating me like a plaything...</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> Or maybe someone will save you.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Who&#39;s there!?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> It&#39;s me. You&#39;ve certainly been through the wringer, haven&#39;t you. Did you inflict that blast on yourself?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Oh hey, it&#39;s the loathsome ice bitch queen.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Said the mad dog.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> So what do you want? I thought we already agreed to leave each other alone and do what we please.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> That&#39;s no longer the case. I have a Master now, you see.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> That&#39;s right, I have a Master!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> You have a whaaaaaat!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> A Master...? A Master!? You!? The bitchy lioness who mauls anyone that gets close!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> And one you&#39;re so proud of you&#39;d announce it twice, no less!?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> It just goes to show the difference between us, mad dog.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Why you little...!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Well, so what! Knowing you, I bet your stupid Master&#39;s barely a step up from an apprentice!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> They&#39;re probably a nervous, shady-looking wreck who can barely squeak out a command.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> That&#39;s the only kind of Master you could...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Hi, I&#39;m Fujimaru. Nice to meet you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Hi, I&#39;m the nervous, shady-looking Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> [\u2642 Dude /\u2640 Girl], I don&#39;t know what she told you, but you&#39;re being played. I mean, you did save the world, right?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Surely you can find a better Servant than her.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Why, that would be me! Rest assured, Jeanne Alter,Fujimaru can count on me as well.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Hey pal, you&#39;d better let me join your Servants. I can do a damn sight better than THESE two.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Hey, that&#39;s not very nice!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Not one bit. Tell me, exactly what are we lacking?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Ugh, there&#39;s so much I can&#39;t even be bothered to list it all.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Anyway, it looks like the hyenas have caught my Noble Phantasm&#39;s scent.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Hey, get rid of them for me. We can talk after that.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The battle is over. Well done, Master.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Wait, you&#39;re a Shielder? Why aren&#39;t you over here helping us?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Well, uh...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Due to extenuating circumstances, I&#39;m currently on Servant leave.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Is that so? Kinda wish you weren&#39;t, seeing as you&#39;re our last bastion of defense and all.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Ah well, I guess we&#39;ll figure something out.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Th-thank you for understanding.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m honestly a bit taken aback. I didn&#39;t know you thought so highly of me.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> I remember you refusing to let go of your shield even though you had to fight back tears of fright.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Seeing as we detestable holy maidens don&#39;t get scared at all, I figure you&#39;d make a better human.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Ugh, what a waste.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> I&#39;m sure we wouldn&#39;t have lost if you&#39;d been on our side.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> R-right...</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Hey, mad dog.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Stay out of this, ice bitch queen. No one cares what you think.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> I&#39;m told that the Servant possessing Mash is Galahad.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> That makes her one of my knights. I won&#39;t have you trying to poach her.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Hey! Who knew the ice bitch queen even had emotions left anymore?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> But unfortunately for you, she&#39;s NOT Galahad, so I can do what I damn well please, ice bitch queen!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...Is that so.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Now now, that&#39;s enough.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> How can you be neutral on this, Master? You&#39;re supposed to be on my side!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> HAH! First your Shielder dumps you, now your Master! Whatcha gonna do, ice bitch queen?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Can&#39;t we all just get along?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Me? Get along with her?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Yeah. For once I have to agree with her, Master. What are you, stupid? Did you mean that as a joke? Because I&#39;m not laughing.</p><hr><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Ahem!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> The important thing is that we have a new and capable ally! Now let&#39;s go begin our counterattack!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> And what makes you think you can give us orders, Archer?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Hey, I remember you now! I&#39;m gonna mess you up for what you did!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I am sorry for sneaking into your territory. Please forgive me; I was rather desperate at the time!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> You think I give a shit, old man?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> I&#39;m pissed off about you blowing a hole through my gut.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Huh?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> WHAT!? You better not have forgotten!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Never mind Shinjuku; I had to crawl around the subway just to escape!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> With all those guys after me, I never even had a chance to catch my breath.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Oh, hey, would you look at that? It&#39;s stake burning o&#39;clock. I&#39;m gonna crisp you up real good!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Waaait!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I understand how you feel, but please, just slow down! I&#39;m not the Archer of Shinjuku you think I am!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Huh?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I see you don&#39;t believe me. Not that I blame you; we do look exactly alike.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> But it&#39;s the truth. He&#39;s the evil Archer, and I&#39;m the good Archer!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Huh?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hahaha! No wonder she doesn&#39;t believe you!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Indeed...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> To be honest, we still don&#39;t completely trust you ourselves.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> He&#39;s a good person.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Uh...Master, have you had your eyes checked lately? Or your head, for that matter?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> You know what, maybe we should get you a complete physical, just to be safe...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You can trust him.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> R-really?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Nope, sorry, I can&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Strange. For some reason, these old eyes of mine can&#39;t seem to stop crying.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> For someone with genius-level detective skills, you&#39;d think you&#39;d know how not to act suspiciously!</p><hr><h2 id="section-6-wolf-surrounded" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-6-wolf-surrounded" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 6: Wolf Surrounded</h2><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Hmm. His good side, eh...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Hmm...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I can certainly understand why you don&#39;t feel like you can trust him.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But if nothing else, he really did risk his life to defend Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...I see.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> All right, fine. I still don&#39;t trust him, but I can deal with him accompanying us.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Is that so? Because I don&#39;t recall allowing YOU to accompany us.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> I&#39;ve got at least as much right to come along as this Shinjuku Archer guy does!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Honestly, I&#39;m amazed you&#39;ve made it this far dragging him along.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Are you simply incapable of being quiet? I can&#39;t stand the rattling of your chains and armor all the time.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Oh, like you&#39;re one to talk.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...Hey, now that I take a closer look, that&#39;s not a bad outfit, at least by your standards.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Why&#39;d you pick it anyway?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Not that I care.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> What&#39;s so notable about my outfit? This is Shinjuku, remember?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> A good Servant always dresses to match their location.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> A Lancer I know had a silly-looking Hawaiian shirt that was really quite becoming on him. It suited his flippant persona perfectly.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> So why shouldn&#39;t I wear the same type of clothing? I don&#39;t see the problem.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Hmm...Hmmmmmm...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> So hey, on a completely different topic.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> That place over there looks pretty shady.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Shady?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> All I see are the remains of a perfectly ordinary boutique.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Maybe that&#39;s all you see, but I&#39;ve got a sixth sense about these sorts of things.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> There&#39;s something there. I&#39;m sure of it.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...Is that so? Something&#39;s there, huh...? I see.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> So on that note, I&#39;m gonna go check it out! Wait right here. If you leave me behind, I&#39;ll kill you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh!? Jeanne!?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Astonishing.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> It&#39;s refreshing to see how remarkably straightforward she is.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> It happened so fast I couldn&#39;t even think of a way to stop her...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Let&#39;s wait for her.</p><hr><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Waiting is all fine and good, but...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That sounds like multiple motorcycles. Be careful, Master!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m picking up three sources of powerful magical energy!</p><p><strong>Ruffian A:</strong> Hey hey, check out the bonus just lying around!</p><p><strong>Ruffian B:</strong> Yeehah!

Let&#39;s take &#39;em all!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I can&#39;t tell if they&#39;re being polite or not.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Wait, what!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ahem, my apologies.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> They&#39;re so all over the place that I couldn&#39;t help but be slow to react.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m very sorry, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Don&#39;t worry about it. We&#39;ve got this.</p><hr><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Ugh...I knew that witch would bring us nothing but trouble.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Very well, I suppose I can be moved to deal with them.</p><p><strong>Ruffian A:</strong> Ha ha ha ha! Check these babies out and say that again!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Wha...!?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Oh, they have chimeras.</p><p><strong>Ruffian A:</strong> They&#39;re not just any chimeras!</p><p><strong>Ruffian A:</strong> They&#39;re special Demonic Beasts made by mixing science and magecraft!</p><p><strong>Ruffian A:</strong> The guy who sold them to us said they&#39;re more like Phantasmals, though! That&#39;s how powerful they are!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> I believe you may have been deceived.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I think the term for it is \u201Cfalse advertising\u201D?</p><p><strong>Ruffian A:</strong> We got a volume discount for buying three of them, so it was a killer deal! Go on, Super Chimeras! Sic &#39;em!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Even his name for them is unimaginative!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Regardless, do not let your guard down. I suspect they&#39;re a deal more dangerous than they look.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> They&#39;ve created a haphazard mishmash of defective components, and somehow made it all dangerous!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Regardless, remain alert, and keep your guard up!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Hey, what&#39;s going on?

You&#39;re the one who gave me the signal to use my Noble Phantasm!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> I did no such...</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...You.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Bingo!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Wait, wait! Put down the sacred sword and listen to me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Th-the fire caused by Jeanne&#39;s Noble Phantasm has surrounded you!

And Jeanne&#39;s fire was perfect.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Of course, your orders were absolutely spot-on too, Master.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> The only failure here was in my strategy. I underestimated Rider&#39;s tenacity.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> The hatred that wolf bears is deeper than the ocean itself. The wolf is the one controlling the knight.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I should have realized it sooner. Dullahans are only an urban legend.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> They may seem scary, but they&#39;re nothing more than a harmless concept; at most they&#39;re innocent fright.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> But not that wolf. Its loathing knows no bounds.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> It doesn&#39;t eat people out of hunger, but out of hatred.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> It really despises people that much?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Oh, yes. After what just happened, I&#39;m certain of it.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> That hatred is no mere thing of myth, nor is this wolf something that was simply worshipped and abandoned.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> It is a far more direct kind of hatred. The sort that comes from trauma, like having one&#39;s wife murdered.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> And I know of only one Phantom Spirit who meets that description.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Oh, so it&#39;s an inverse.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> A beast that made its mark in mythology would be more akin to a Phantasmal.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> A being who was once worshipped would never hate humans that much. Certainly not enough to eat them.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I mean, it&#39;s such a barbaric act.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So in other words...an inverse. A famous wolf, with little historical bearing.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> The Wolf King.</p><hr><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> You are correct, Master.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> A man named Seton once wrote about it.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> He described it as a real-life Demonic Beast: a monster so smart it was feared as a literal demon.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> He loathed humans for killing his mate, Blanca, and that hate persisted until his death.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Lobo...the king of Currumpaw.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Now I see. So it grew by feeding on both humans and hatred alike.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Hey.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> The hell&#39;s wrong with you, letting it escape after I went and used my Noble Phantasm?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Oh, yes...Sorry about that. It was all my fault. Feel free to chew me out all you like.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Stay away from me. You stink.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I meant scold me for messing up, not ad hominem insults!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Are you ashamed of yourself for this, Master? You. Should. Be!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> We&#39;ll get him next time.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Yeah. That&#39;s better.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;m sorry.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Don&#39;t do it, Master. Apologize to her once, and you&#39;ll never hear the end of it.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Hey! Shaddap, ice bitch queen!</p><hr><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Anyway, we&#39;ve got this idiot back. Now what do we do?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> It&#39;s unfortunate we weren&#39;t able to finish off the Rider of Shinjuku.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> But with those wounds, it won&#39;t be returning to the front line anytime soon.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> The worst thing about that Rider was its ability to zip around all of Shinjuku.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> But now that it&#39;s immobilized, we can take out the League of Phantom Fiends.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> In other words...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Oh, I know. The Berserker.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Ah, that puppet master, huh...or rather, the puppet herself, as she&#39;s the one who poses the most danger.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I say, didn&#39;t your parents ever teach you two not to finish others&#39; sentences for them!?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Now I&#39;ve gone and wasted a perfectly good eureka face!</p><p><strong>Both:</strong> Shut up.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Come on, Master, say something!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Don&#39;t look at me.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Unfortunately for you, Master is already captivated with me.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Oh please, you wish.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Who in their right mind would be attracted to an ice bitch queen so pale she&#39;d make a corpse look tan?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> That is an unfortunate choice of dying words.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Nope. Nopenopenopenope...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Huh? What&#39;s the problem?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> I mean, she and I are both Alters, so being bad is the same as being good for us.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Speak for yourself. I may allow evil to run amok, but not at the expense of order.</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> I knew you and I wouldn&#39;t get along.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Did you actually think I might consider you an ally?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> If this were a proper Holy Grail War, I&#39;d already have killed you on the spot.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Oh yeah? Well, no time like the present, huh?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Hmm. You make a good point.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> You&#39;re damn right I do, ice bitch queen.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Whoa whoa, this isn&#39;t right. Why is this happening?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Cut that out!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Don&#39;t try to stop me, Master.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> My intuition is telling me to settle this here and now!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Aah! I think your intuition might be wrong!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Stop bickering!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Bickering? Is that what you think this is, Master?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> I&#39;m going to skewer her alive, just like her good-for-nothing son did!</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Haha, well isn&#39;t this something.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> One moment we&#39;re having an ordinary conversation, the next they&#39;re trying to kill each other!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> This is the trouble with altered Servants!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Now now! Now now now now!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I&#39;m sure you both have plenty you wish to say to one another, and things you&#39;d like to kill each other over, but please, this is hardly the time!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Let&#39;s take care of the Berserker of Shinjuku first, then you&#39;ll be free to do whatever terrible violence you wish to each other!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Well? What do you say!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> I suppose I can wait that long to kill her.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Fine with me. I can handle you anytime you&#39;re ready.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Wonderful! It&#39;s great to see you two getting along! Now, let&#39;s use our newly reforged alliance to take out the Berserker of Shinjuku!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Go team!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Let&#39;s get out of here, Master.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Go on, lead the way already. Geez, you can be thick sometimes.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Coming!</p><hr><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> ...Yay team.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Y-yay.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Mash! Thank you!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Haha, easy there, Archer.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Ugh, what&#39;s with this hideout? It stinks, it&#39;s old...It&#39;s perfect for you, ice bitch queen.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Oh, gross! There&#39;s a dog? I hate dogs.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> If you don&#39;t like it, you&#39;re free to turn into your spirit form. Or even better, disappear for good.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> You wish. Anyway, if Master can take it, then so can I.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Tch.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Now come on, Master. Don&#39;t you have anything to say?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> I&#39;m waiting.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s hot!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Is that it!? Nothing about how good it looks on me, or how well I wear it!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It looks great on you.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> I know, right? I-I mean, of course it does, since I&#39;m the one wearing it and all.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> (What a pushover. )</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Oh, another phone call...How would you like to handle it, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Hello?</p><hr><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> I&#39;m glad the rescue mission worked out.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> I only wish I had some good news to follow it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Talk to me.</p><hr><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Usually, I prefer to make my reports once I&#39;ve grasped the full truth of a situation.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> In cases where there&#39;s no room for conjecture, and ordinary people can&#39;t understand what&#39;s going on...</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> I step in and conduct rigorous investigations.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> But this time...I&#39;m afraid there was only so much even I could do.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Even though there are still a number of unknowns, I need to pass this information on to you right away\u2013regrettable as that may be.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> It&#39;s incredibly vexing, but I&#39;m afraid I have no choice.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> After all, time is not on our side. I&#39;ve never seen this man so desperate.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> He plans everything down to the smallest detail, and thus utterly detests when things take too long.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> So while this method is atypical for him...it also means that everything in my investigation points to him as the culprit.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> In this malicious Shinjuku, the station has become a veritable dungeon, and every building here is in some state of disrepair. However...</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Have you noticed that there was one building which has been completely replaced?</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> ...That&#39;s right. You&#39;ve seen it before. That strange tower taking the place of the Metropolitan Government Building. The tower that grows day by day.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> That tower is...the barrel of a gun.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> The barrel...of a gun?</p><hr><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Hahaha! I don&#39;t blame you for being taken aback, Master! But as wild as it may seem, it&#39;s the truth.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> The Archer of Shinjuku\u2013the one who isn&#39;t your Servant\u2013is the leader of the League of Phantom Fiends.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> And I now know what it is he&#39;s after.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> He plans to destroy the earth. To obliterate it.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> To tackle that tower, you must first defeat the League of Phantom Fiends.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> The Berserker of Shinjuku, the Assassin of Shinjuku, the Rider of Shinjuku, and one more...</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> An Archer that uses modern-day weaponry.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Jeanne d&#39;Arc Alter knows him well, so you should ask her about him.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be heading out to defeat these Servants as soon as you have a chance of victory.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Who do you plan on facing next?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> The Berserker.</p><hr><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Hmm. A reasonable decision.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> The Berserker can be found near Kabukicho. He&#39;s a typical tyrant, an absolute dystopian.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> There&#39;s also the logistics problem, what with you being outnumbered, but I&#39;m sure you can handle that.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> The real problem is...well, you. I&#39;m guessing you&#39;ll be presented with a choice.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Though I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ll get hurt no matter what decision you make.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> As your guide, let me give you some advice: endure.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Whatever it is, you can take it. Hang on to that nobility of yours, and you&#39;ll always be you!</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Oh, and as for the Archer of Shinjuku...</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Don&#39;t trust him too much. I have no doubt that he is your enemy.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> As long as I&#39;m going around investigating like this, the Archer will surely be able to deduce the conclusion I&#39;ve reached.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> So telling [\u2642 him /\u2640 her] not to trust him is not a stretch by any means.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Anyway, now I just wait to see how he reacts upon learning about this.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> No doubt Master will try to trust him, but some suspicions will surely remain.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> When the time comes, will he attempt to kill [\u2642 him /\u2640 her], or merely deceive [\u2642 him /\u2640 her]?</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Or perhaps he&#39;ll do something that not even \u201CI\u201D can predict. Either way, we&#39;ll soon find out.</p><h2 id="section-7-coloratura-disassembled" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-7-coloratura-disassembled" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 7: Coloratura Disassembled</h2><p><strong>Narration:</strong> There are several ways of leading people into a trap. One is to cut off their escape route, making them think their current path is the only way forward.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Another is to make them think their current path is the way they SHOULD go forward, and stop them from considering other paths as options.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I wonder which trap [\u2642 he /\u2640 she] will fall for? Not that it makes any difference now, of course.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Since [\u2642 he&#39;s /\u2640 she&#39;s] made the wrong choice right from the beginning.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> What&#39;s this? You say you cannot trust me!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Talk about the most reasonable advice in the world. I don&#39;t have anything else to add to that.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> I hate to admit it, but I agree with you.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> The very fact that our enemy has the same Servant is grounds for suspicion.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Has anyone ever told you two that you have trust issues?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Anyway, it doesn&#39;t matter. You still trust me, don&#39;t you, Master!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> More or less.</p><hr><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> A most practical answer!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Very well then, let us go and defeat the Berserker of Shinjuku, so that you may trust me more.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> But first, let me tell you everything I know.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> While we do have a better chance of victory now that there are three of us, it&#39;s still only a chance.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> If we were to attack head-on, we would surely be torn apart.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...Yeah, you&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...Indeed.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Is it really that dangerous?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Jeanne and Altria are both extremely powerful Servants.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I don&#39;t like the odds of a head-on battle either, but I can&#39;t believe you would have no chance at all.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Well, to put it simply, it&#39;s all about numbers.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> There are about two hundred Coloraturas stationed in Kabukicho, and another hundred that patrol around Shinjuku on a regular basis.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So...three hundred all together.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> In other words, if we charge in head-on, we&#39;ll be greeted by two hundred Coloraturas all at once!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Hahaha! Needless to say, we wouldn&#39;t last long.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Even if we Servants didn&#39;t die, Master certainly would, and without [\u2642 him /\u2640 her], I&#39;m afraid the game is over.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> And that&#39;s not all.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> While these two hundred Coloraturas are wandering around Kabukicho, they&#39;re also listening to a song playing from the loudspeakers.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A song...?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Naturally, a song sung by the Berserker of Shinjuku&#39;s beloved. Our heroine, Christine.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Every time she finishes singing, the Coloraturas applaud. This repeats all day, every day.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yikes, talk about violating labor laws.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> As it stands, Kabukicho is presently an impregnable fortress.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> And if that weren&#39;t enough, the area is a maze of similar-looking buildings, any one of which could contain a number of Coloraturas.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Not to mention that they can see us all clearly from atop the buildings.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> If we find ourselves in a situation with puppets coming at us from all sides...then it&#39;ll be the end of the line, Master. And I don&#39;t like that.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> I believe I&#39;ve fought some of the patrolling puppets before. What else can you tell us about them?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Oh yeah, I&#39;ve busted a few of them up myself.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I&#39;ve fought them more than once too, and managed to fend them off before they brought in reinforcements.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> But no matter what, within thirty-six hours, they once again number two hundred.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Quite the phenomenon, isn&#39;t it!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> And here&#39;s another bit of information.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> The Coloraturas assigned to patrol don&#39;t just keep Kabukicho safe. They also regularly abduct people.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Why is that?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Oh...I think you can imagine.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> And that is what I know of Kabukicho.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> So, has anyone come up with a strategy that doesn&#39;t include attacking head-on?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Sneaking in?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I&#39;m afraid that with two hundred puppets to contend with, that would be all but impossible.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Sniping?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Hmm...Sadly, I doubt that even my entire long-range arsenal would be enough to take her down.</p><hr><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> In that case, I shall cut them all down with my Excalibur Morgan.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Unfortunately, that won&#39;t work either.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Even if you obliterated all of Kabukicho, the Coloraturas and the Berserker would survive.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Besides, I&#39;m sure you too have noticed the abnormality that permeates all of Shinjuku.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> While it may not be at Age of Gods levels...</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> For Tokyo in 1999, there is an impossible amount of magical energy swirling about.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> That energy has been pouring into concrete buildings, to the point that even they now harbor it.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Thus, I am forced to conclude that your sacred sword can do little to wreak devastation on Kabukicho.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...Yes, I suppose you&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Ooh, so you admit you&#39;re a weakling? I guess that does take courage of a sort.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> And I suppose you could do better with your little matchstick?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> It&#39;s more than hot enough to melt you, ice bitch queen.</p><p><strong>Both:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Easy there.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Easy now.</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> You stay out of this!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I think I may have a suggestion.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> But first, there is something I&#39;d like you all to do: bring back one Coloratura without harming it.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...And why do you want us to do that?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Kabukicho is dominated by illusions and puppets. So to see it clearly, we need a puppet of our own.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Ugh, what a pain.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Very well then. Come with me, Master.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> There are a number of materials I&#39;ll need to modify it, so I&#39;ll go and find those in the meantime.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> That shouldn&#39;t be too difficult, since the local merchants have them for sale.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> I&#39;m still surprised that the Count of Monte Cristo said that we shouldn&#39;t trust him.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Perhaps he knows Archer&#39;s true identity?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> I mean, that guy&#39;s a puzzle in and of himself.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Well, whatever.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> If he&#39;s gonna betray us, it&#39;ll be at a crucial moment. Until then, we can keep using each other.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Shhh.... Coloraturas.</p><p><strong>Citizen A:</strong> Eee!</p><p><strong>Citizen A:</strong> Please, don&#39;t! Somebody, help me!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> They&#39;re...they&#39;re taking the people away!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I know we have to stop them, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Yeah yeah, that&#39;s very kind of you. Just don&#39;t blame me if you get caught up in a big mess.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> I see you&#39;re preparing for battle even as you say that. Perhaps you&#39;re kinder than you let on.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> All right, it&#39;s time to capture a Coloratura. We await your orders, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> All right, we&#39;ve captured a puppet and helped the people escape.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> \u201CEndure\u201D sounds like something the Count of Monte Cristo would say.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> What? What&#39;s going on?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> It&#39;s nothing.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...Master, I shall carry the Coloratura. Why don&#39;t you kill some time in the bookstore?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Huh? What&#39;re you talking about? Let&#39;s get going already.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Ugh, this is such a pain...</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Oh for...Are you capable of anything at all other than sheer ineptitude!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Wh-where&#39;d that come from!?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Welcome back! I&#39;m all set and ready to go.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Here, a Coloratura.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Hmm...Just as I thought.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> So you knew that when you made us carry it? What a depraved little man you are.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I figured it would help us to know just what sort of opponent we&#39;re up against.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> See for yourself what&#39;s beneath its face.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> The hell? What is that?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s...!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> A human brain. And not only that; its eyes and nerves are all human too.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Master, I encourage you not to look too closely. You won&#39;t soon forget the sight.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Urp!</p><hr><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Now do you understand, Fujimaru? That Berserker is turning people into puppets.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> First he strips them of their skin, then he removes their bones, leaving only some muscle and nerves, which he then packs inside an empty mannequin.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> When he&#39;s done, he has a new autonomous marionette\u2013one that sings, no less. This leaves us with two questions.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> First, what is his goal in doing this? And second, is it possible to save these puppets?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> For the first question...Ordinarily, one would think that humans move better than puppets.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> However, now that I have dismantled this one, I can see that this is not the case.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> The more I look at it, the more his artistic sensibilities shine through.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> What do you think, Leonardo da Vinci of Chaldea?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yes, I see what you mean. Much as I hate to admit it, this handiwork shows true artistry.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Da Vinci, what do you mean?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> This is most likely based on loathing and fastidiousness.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Loathing of the human form, and fastidiousness in thinking of non-human humans as beautiful.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> These two things overlap, and as a result, him creating these things is nothing but a mere hobby.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> A hobby...?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yes, a hobby. He doesn&#39;t create these things because he needs them to fight for him.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> He simply creates them because he finds them beautiful.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> So there&#39;s no meaning to them?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> There&#39;s no sense expecting such a thing from a Berserker. Especially not one quite so mad as him.</p><hr><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Now, as to the second question: is it possible to save these people?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> No. Once someone has been turned into a puppet, they&#39;ll remain a puppet until their death.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> For starters, the process of making them into puppets shatters their minds beyond repair. They&#39;re not alive; they are being preserved in an undead state.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> What hope of rescue could there be for them once they&#39;ve seen their very bodies disassembled?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> No, they are very much dead and broken. A horrific crime, but since they are already beyond hope...</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Master, what would you think of misusing this puppet for our own ends?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Misuse...?</p><hr><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Hold it. What exactly do you have in mind?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I mean to plant a bomb inside this puppet.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...Huh.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> These puppets return to Kabukicho at regular intervals. Once our armed puppet sneaks in...KABOOM!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> It will wreak havoc among the puppets, and give us a chance to assassinate their queen.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> This way, we can take out the Berserker of Shinjuku.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...It does make sense.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Wait! That&#39;s\u2013</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Yeah, I guess that&#39;ll work. This thing stopped being human a long time ago.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Any semblance of who it used to be is gone. It&#39;s nothing more than an empty husk now.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> It&#39;s even worse than evil spirits and stuff like that;at least those still have their old personalities.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> But this thing is completely empty. Nothing we need to concern ourselves about.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...Tell me, Archer of Shinjuku: what is it you would have our Master choose?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Proof of [\u2642 his /\u2640 her] willingness to get [\u2642 his /\u2640 her] hands dirty here in Shinjuku.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I assume you&#39;ve heard the expression\u201Cfight fire with fire\u201D yes?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Ah yes, a well-worn classic. To destroy evil, one must use a different form of evil.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> There&#39;s also a saying in the medical community about how poison in small doses can be a remedy.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It&#39;s the same principle that gave us penicillin from blue mold and anticoagulation meds from leeches.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> For that matter, vaccines are nothing more than poison administered in small enough doses to trigger the body&#39;s defenses, giving it protection against stronger poisons.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> You have already proven yourself to be more than worthy of being a Master.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> But you have yet to demonstrate your willingness to wade through the muck that is Shinjuku to achieve our goals.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> So, can you push the button to detonate such a bomb?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Now then, it will take some time to modify this puppet. Feel free to think it over in the meantime.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I, um, suppose this won&#39;t sound very convincing, since I&#39;m not there with you, but...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You will always be my Master, the one who reached out to me on that day.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No matter what happens there in Shinjuku, that part of you will always shine forth.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m still a long way from repaying the debt I owe you, but that much, I know for certain.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s okay.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Yes. You&#39;ll be okay, Senpai.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Thank you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Not at all. I wish there was more I could do to help.</p><hr><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> All right, the puppet is ready to go, Master. Shall we?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Let&#39;s go!</p><hr><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Okay, Master. Here&#39;s the detonator.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I&#39;ll tell you when it&#39;s the right time.

Though I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll find that little solace.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Anyway, it&#39;s time.

The Coloratura is ready.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I&#39;ve also rewritten its programming. How, you ask? That&#39;s my little secret.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> How big will the explosion be?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> It should be quite destructive for something improvised solely from materials found here in Shinjuku!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> At the very least, it should be enough to sow chaos when it goes off.

Not a clue.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I suppose just seeing your resolve was more than enough proof for me.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> After all, it doesn&#39;t really matter that much whether it is you or I who presses the button, does it?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I may have completely forgotten my past, but there is one thing I&#39;m absolutely sure of:</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I am an evil person. There is no doubt about that much.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> You showed me that you were prepared to dirty your hands.

I had planned on letting you press the button right up to the last instant.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Are you sure about this?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Of course. You were ready to kill. That&#39;s all I needed to know.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> If you&#39;re prepared to fight evil with evil, it doesn&#39;t matter whether you&#39;re the one to press the button or not.</p><hr><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> What&#39;s important is that you have an iron will. The resolve to cross the line and kill. The determination to do what must be done to achieve your goal.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> That is what the Holy Grail War\u2013the battle to repair humanity\u2013entails. Now, let&#39;s get going!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> I&#39;ll clear a path!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> There are still so many of them, even after that massive explosion!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> You&#39;re up, Dynamite Woman!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Who&#39;re you calling dynamite!?

That explosion was truly merciless, in every sense of the word!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Very well then, let&#39;s start taking care of these Coloraturas.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Our targets are the Berserker of Shinjuku\u2013also known as the Phantom of the Opera\u2013and Christine Daa\xE9!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> All right, we&#39;re in! Now, Mash!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Right! I&#39;m picking up three...no, four Servants!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Two of them are Altria and Jeanne, but the other two are quickly closing in on Master!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> So, the Berserker&#39;s here!</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong> Ah...Aah...Aaah!</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong> The Coloraturas...Our precious audience is burning up!</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong> The puppets I created to praise Christine&#39;s singing are disappearing!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Hey there, Berserker. Actually, hold on, I&#39;ve been wondering: exactly which of you is the Berserker?</p><p><strong>Christine:</strong> Burn, abuse, brutalize, kill! Aah, my beloved are leaving, disappearing, vanishing!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Hahahaha! I guess it doesn&#39;t matter when you&#39;re both so distraught!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> But then again, that isn&#39;t really Christine, is it? It&#39;s just a doll!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um...Are you sure it was a good idea to say that?</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong> Hehe...hehehehe. You&#39;re wrong. She is, without a doubt, my beloved songstress, Christine.</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong> A lonely Phantom Spirit. A princess turned doll, since she was never alive to begin with.</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong> A sad doll who had everything but her songs taken. As a doll, Christine was broken from the start.</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong> It was my dream, my desire, that broke her. Thus, it is only right that I am now her subordinate.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A Phantom Spirit!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> So basically, Christine was summoned without enough Spirit Origin, and sealed into a puppet?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> ...I see. No wonder she went mad.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> If any of us were robbed of something essential to who we were, it would drive us mad too.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> ...In that case, Erik, that leaves no room for doubt: you are the Berserker.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Instead of taking responsibility, you have abandoned it utterly. In your cruelty, you have chosen to sacrifice yourself and Christine in a spiral of mutual destruction.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> And if that weren&#39;t enough, you have also sacrificed hundreds of lives along the way!</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong> ...And what are you going to do about that, Archer?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> That&#39;s not up to me to decide.... Master! Your orders!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Let&#39;s take them down.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Well said, Master! They must be defeated, or there will be no end to this madness!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Let&#39;s stop them.</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong> ...I see. You mean to stop me, do you? Very well then...Come with me, Christine!</p><hr><p><strong>Phantom:</strong> Our audience is still too small! Our accolades still too few in number! Your voice deserves to be heard by all for years and years to come!</p><p><strong>Christine:</strong> Let&#39;s break them all, let&#39;s kill them all, let&#39;s fight them all, let&#39;s sing.</p><p><strong>Christine:</strong> My song must be heard throughout the world, since this world is already coming to an end.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Their magical energy is surging. Get ready, Master! They&#39;re about to attack!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Let&#39;s do this!</p><hr><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong> Aah, her song...It stopped.</p><p><strong>Christine:</strong> La...La...La...Ahh, I can no longer sing. At last, I don&#39;t have to sing anymore.</p><p><strong>Christine:</strong> Wait...Did I want to sing? Or did I not want to sing?</p><p><strong>Christine:</strong> Tell me, Erik. Was I summoned in order to sing?</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong> Yes, Christine, you were. But now, that role is over. It&#39;s over.</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong> It&#39;s all over. The curtain is about to fall on our stage.</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong> Thank you, Christine. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. There is no one more beautiful than you.</p><p><strong>Christine:</strong> I see.... You&#39;re a liar, Erik.</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong> ...You&#39;re right. My love for you has long since been tarnished, yet I pretended not to notice.</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong> I averted my eyes from this truth, and continued to drown in Shinjuku&#39;s desires.</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong> What a fool I was.... Master of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong> The League of Phantom Fiends is full of desire, much like how we sought out accolades.</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong> One member seeks to exacerbate, another seeks glory. But one thing remains incomprehensible.</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong> You, who stand above us all\u2013the Archer. What in the world is it that YOU desire?</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong> You are\u2013</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong> Guh...!?</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong> Emiya...You bastard!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> !?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> He burst...from the inside!?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> You talk too much.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> What kind of Berserker grieves at their own death, anyway?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> If you&#39;re really broken, act like it and just die in misery.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Aren&#39;t you...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Searching for Spirit Origin...An inverted state, so an Alter...Class: Archer...Emiya!?</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> So, my Spirit Origin record&#39;s still around. But that doesn&#39;t change the fact that you&#39;re just my quarry.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> I&#39;ll kill you all without a second thought, so don&#39;t complain too much when you&#39;re dead.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Hmm...Tell me, why did you kill him?</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Tch. Some reason I shouldn&#39;t have?</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> A moron trying to monologue on his deathbed doesn&#39;t deserve pity.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Honestly...it feels weird just hearing you, of all people, ask me that.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> I guess that&#39;s why you&#39;re only half of the real Archer of Shinjuku.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Yes, you&#39;ve got me there.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Hm? Hang on. If you know who I really am, do you know my True Name?</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Of course. A guy as famous as you? It&#39;d be weirder if I didn&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> ...Not that I&#39;ll be telling you.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Oh come now, don&#39;t be like that. Even a hint will suffice.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> So that&#39;s the way your good side thinks, huh? Don&#39;t worry about it; it won&#39;t matter when you&#39;re dead.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Ngh!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Altria! Jeanne!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Another enemy Servant has shown up! Please hurry to Master and Archer immediately!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> So the Berserker is gone? But...the Coloraturas still remain!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Ugh, I don&#39;t have time for this crap! I&#39;ve got my hands full with these puppets!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I hate to fight one battle after another, but it seems we have no choice! Master, your orders!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Got it!</p><hr><p><strong>G\uFF1A???:</strong> No need for that.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> What!?</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Tch...!</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> Nice to meet you, Lord Emiya. I am Hassan of the Cursed Arm, an Assassin.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> Forgive me for joining this side; I have my reasons.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Well well, so you got summoned too.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> I&#39;m surprised an Assassin would try to play hero instead of keeping to their usual dirty work.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> If this is some kind of joke, it&#39;s not very funny,Hassan-i Sabbah.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> It won&#39;t be much longer until those two escape from the Coloraturas and make their way here.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> Perhaps it would be easier for you to make a retreat? Not that I&#39;m obligated to warn you, of course.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> Of course, if you wish to be torn open like the Berserker of Shinjuku, then by all means, ready your weapons.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> In fact, go ahead. Take aim. Give me an excuse to bury you here and now.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> ...How irritating.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> I don&#39;t much care for confusing situations like this, so I&#39;ll be taking my leave.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Besides, I really can&#39;t stand her!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Tch...One more second, and he would have been dead.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Dammit! Just another instant, and I could&#39;ve burned his stupid scarred face off!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...So who&#39;re you? An enemy?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No, this man is an ally!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Good to see you again, Hassan! Um, assuming you remember us, of course.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> My apologies, but I&#39;m afraid I do not. However, I do know that my Spirit Origin sees you as friends.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> So...an ally, eh.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> Indeed. I am humbly at your service, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Thanks!</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> Not at all. If I wish to save this world, I must save you as well.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Feel free to loosen up a bit.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> Thank you, Master. But I&#39;m afraid this is simply how I am.</p><hr><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Well, we can all catch up later. Right now, we need to make our escape from Kabukicho!</p><h2 id="section-9-transforming-vagabond" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-9-transforming-vagabond" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 9: Transforming Vagabond</h2><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> So, the Berserker of Shinjuku is gone.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> At the risk of sounding a bit clich\xE9d, it seems we&#39;ve finally reached the beginning of the end.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I&#39;ve checked my calculations countless times. They appear correct. Time continues to flow, pooling at a single point.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> ...Now then, I believe Assassin was next.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> The Berserker of Shinjuku is gone. Or rather, I killed him.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I know. I also know how you ran away with your tail between your legs.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Wow, word travels fast. Then you also know why I did that.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Of course. Assassin told you to.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> I don&#39;t get it. Why risk the danger of getting close to them?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Assassin may be chivalrous, but he is also very much a Phantom Spirit.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> A man like that who always pretends to be someone he&#39;s not will never become a Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> So, he cannot resist the temptation to observe heroes up close and personal, in order to determine if they are worth his transforming into them or not.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> It&#39;s too risky. If you ask me, it&#39;s like handing your head over to the enemy.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> It is indeed risky. It&#39;s also glorious, and arrogant.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> He takes everything from his targets and tramples it, as if to relieve the gloom he felt while alive.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> However, his process is entirely too unclear. Assassin has decided to kill the Chaldean Master.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> But when? How? Even I don&#39;t know.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> With his innate chivalry and doppelg\xE4nger nature mixed together...</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Perhaps not even he understands his own thoughts.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> A man like him who could, and would, kill someone he&#39;s talking to at any possible moment is a monster.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> He has become an irredeemable psychotic killer.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> So he&#39;s like an evil, sentient time bomb that could go off at any moment, eh.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> He would hate to be interrupted. Let&#39;s wait and see how this plays out.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I have my own things I must look into.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Wow. I&#39;m surprised you haven&#39;t already turned over every stone there is.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> There is a new variable to consider: one that steadfastly defies quantification and predictability.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Emiya, why don&#39;t you go take a walk around Shinjuku and see how Shakespeare&#39;s craft is coming along?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> According to my calculations, the King Lear monster should soon be complete.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> King Lear, huh. What an interesting choice.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> I wonder what sort of monster a crazed old man like him will turn into here in Shinjuku.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> All right, I&#39;ll go take a look.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Now, it should be about time to make your entrance. You can hide, but traces of your presence remain.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> You could have erased them if you&#39;d put your mind to it, but since you let them be, you&#39;re clearly choosing to make yourself known.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> My rival, my sworn enemy, my bane. I&#39;ve waited for this moment for what feels like eternity.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> The League of Phantom Fiends, the Barrel, me, the Phantom Spirits, all of it...</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> ...was to set the stage for your entrance,Sherlock Holmes.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> Aha, so this is the roost you mentioned. It rather reeks of hamburgers, doesn&#39;t it.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> Hmm, I see I&#39;m not very welcome here. I suppose I can&#39;t blame you, given what I look like.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> If you don&#39;t like it, Assassin, you&#39;re free to leave, or to return to your spirit form.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Jeanne, you should leave regardless. And return to spirit form while you&#39;re at it.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Hahaha, now now. The important thing is that we managed to defeat the Berserker of Shinjuku.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I think this calls for a celebratory toast!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> No thanks.

I knew you&#39;d come through, Hassan! Would you like a beer? Low-malt beer? Whiskey?</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> Whiskey would be grand.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> In that case, I believe I shall have a beer! Or rather, a cheap low-malt beer from a no-name brewery.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Hahaha! I can&#39;t say it&#39;s delicious, but it&#39;s not terrible either. It&#39;s perfectly middle-of-the-road.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> What an odd thing to focus on.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> All right, Hassan!

HA!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I&#39;m the besht!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Mmh...I&#39;m feelin&#39; shleepy.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> ...Zzz.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> ...I did not know that Servants could get drunk.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> If we want to, yes. How strange; he seems like just a harmless old man when intoxicated.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> Do you all know what sort of man this Archer of Shinjuku is?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> You&#39;re gonna tell us he&#39;s our enemy, right? We already know that.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> He claims to have amnesia.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> You don&#39;t actually believe something so absurd, do you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I do.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> I see.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> Perhaps it is not my place to say, but don&#39;t you think you may be too trusting, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It doesn&#39;t matter either way.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> I see.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> ...How gracious of you.</p><hr><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> I must say, Master, you are a most admirable [\u2642 man /\u2640 woman].</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> You not only prevented the Incineration of Humanity, you even came here to resolve this small Singularity.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s that small.</p><hr><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> Oh, but it is. For that matter, Shinjuku itself is not even worthy of being saved.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> Shinjuku in 1999 was a perfectly ordinary city full of squalor and fever...just like any other city.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> If humanity had been completely incinerated, then this distortion would also have some meaning.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> But you have already taken care of that. As such, this distortion will disappear on its own one day.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> Even if the Holy Grail were used, this hell wouldn&#39;t last a month.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That may be, but the incineration was only just averted. Everything could still fall apart, starting here.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Especially when we still don&#39;t know who we&#39;re up against or what they want.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> The destruction of this planet...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Huh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Hassan?</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> I heard about it before. What the League of Phantom Fiends wants is utter devastation.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> To smash apart this entire planet...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Come now, you&#39;re just making up nonsense. There&#39;s no way that could actually happen.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> I agree. But the fact remains, that is their objective.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> The Count of Monte Cristo...</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That seeker of vengeance said the same thing? Hmm...No, it&#39;s still nonsense.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Even at full power, a top Servant&#39;s Noble Phantasm almost certainly couldn&#39;t break an entire planet apart.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> And even if an Anti-Planet Noble Phantasm existed, on paper, it wouldn&#39;t be enough to destroy this one.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> Shhh. Please be quiet.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Hassan?</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> ...It seems that someone is skulking around this building.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> Would you mind investigating it, Lady Mash?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> O-okay.... I&#39;m sorry, but I can&#39;t seem to find anything.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Mash checks the perimeter at regular intervals. If there were anything suspicious out there, we&#39;d know.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> So they have concealed their presence. This may be an Assassin at work. Let&#39;s go take a look, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Got it.</p><hr><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> Oh, the rest of you, please stay put. The two of us shall go out first.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> How strange. There&#39;s no one here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Whew, I thought as much. Thank goodness.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> Nonetheless...This accomplishes what I set out to do.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What do you mean?</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> Hmm, how should I explain it...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> Nothing to say, hmm? Perhaps you already understand what&#39;s going on?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...Hold it. Who are you?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Hassan...?</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> ...Trust is something accumulated over time.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> Anyone who would trust a stranger unconditionally is nothing but a fool.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> First, they must observe the other person carefully, and overcome numerous hardships together.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> Then, and only then can two people be bonded as true friends and comrades.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> Now, Master, let me ask you: am I one such person?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh no. His Spirit Origin values...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master, get out of there! That&#39;s not Hassan!</p><p><strong>G\uFF1ACursed Arm? :</strong> Nope, sorry.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AAssassin of Shinjuku:</strong> Haha, what&#39;s your deal? You&#39;re hilarious!</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AAssassin of Shinjuku:</strong> I was going to kill you, but I changed my mind! This&#39;ll be a lot more fun with a hostage!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Who&#39;re you!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Did you just transform!? ...No, it was nothing like that!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You WERE Hassan! You had his voice, his demeanor...even Shaytan&#39;s arm!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> There&#39;s only so far shape-shifting can go. You were more like...</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> Hm? More like what, Da Vinci!?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> More like his shadow, you say?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> A doppelg\xE4nger!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> Hey, you got it! I might look chivalrous. I might even BE chivalrous. But on the inside...!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> Nah, I can&#39;t go around telling you! Anyway, I&#39;m gonna hold on to Master here for a while!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...Interesting.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Yeah, real interesting.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> Ah, the beautiful duo! So you did figure out it was me!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> You know, I figured you had my number all along, but I just couldn&#39;t resist the surprise reveal!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> Sorry &#39;bout that!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> If you don&#39;t get your nasty-ass breath out of Master&#39;s face, I&#39;m gonna burn you alive!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> Ooh, very nice! That is truly beautiful murderous intent in your eyes!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> As a thrill-seeking gentleman, this is just the kind of excitement I crave!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> But, also speaking as a gentleman, it would be rude and stuff to fight here.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> So, on that note, I&#39;ll be waiting with your dear Master for you to join us elsewhere!</p><p><strong>Both:</strong> You&#39;re not going anywhere!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> Hahaha! You might not believe it, but I&#39;m faster than I look!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> Go ahead; try and catch me if you can!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Come on, ice bitch queen, do something!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Silence, mad dog! I&#39;ll take Cuirassier Alter. Try to keep up with us!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Don&#39;t gotta tell me twice! So what about the drunk old fart?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Who cares!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> That cheeky bitch...!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> Whuh oh, looks like Altria Alter&#39;s catching up quick! Guess I&#39;ll have to buy some time!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> !</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Hornets!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> You know what, this looks like it&#39;ll be a pretty good show!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Altria!</p><hr><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> What!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;ve got orders for you!</p><hr><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...Very well. Then give me your orders, Master!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Knowing you, I&#39;m certain you can assess the situation calmly no matter the circumstances!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Here come the Hornets!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> This ends now!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> Ha ha ha! I can&#39;t believe you were able to give orders under these circumstances!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> You&#39;re really something! My hat&#39;s off to you, no joke!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> In fact, this is too much fun to stop here! And look, here come Shakespeare&#39;s monsters, ready at last!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> Go on, show these guys what you&#39;ve got!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Shakespeare&#39;s...monsters?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m detecting magical energy approaching you at high speeds. It appears to be...a spriggan!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Just what we needed...Hm? Hang on, that&#39;s not a spriggan!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It&#39;s clearly based on one, but the design is different. That&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> Aha! It looks like the first one out is King Lear!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Huh? King Lear? As in Shakespeare&#39;s play?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> The very same! All right, Your Majesty, why don&#39;t you go and sock that sad old lunatic a good one!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That thing is no King Lear!</p><hr><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...Excalibur Morgan!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...Got him!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> Well yes, but you pushed yourself too hard to take him down quickly. Now you&#39;re exhausted.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> So? You&#39;re a fool if you think I would lose to a miserable outlaw like\u2013</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> Man, that was an even better show than I&#39;d hoped! But, I think it&#39;s time for the curtain call now.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Master...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So high...!</p><hr><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> Hahaha! Adios, amigos!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> And bye-bye, everyone at Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The signal is being jammed! Master!

I&#39;m pretty sure you&#39;re not hurt.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> You&#39;ll end up a lot more than hurt if you try to escape, though.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> Anyway, the truth is, I just brought you here on a lark! Sorry in advance if the boss kills you!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Your boss...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> Yup, our boss. The embodiment of evil itself...the real Archer of Shinjuku.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Archer...It&#39;s really you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You&#39;re not the same person...are you?</p><hr><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> That is correct. I am evil, and he is good.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Thanks to the Holy Grail&#39;s power, we\u2013no, I\u2013managed to tear out all that was good and kind in me.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Such things would only be a hindrance in my battle against my rival.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> However, I did not expect that such detritus would gain a consciousness of its own in the process.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Let alone that it would run off and attempt to impede us.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Of course, he was little more than a minor pest scurrying around, until you showed up.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Now the Berserker of Shinjuku has been defeated, and the Rider shows no sign of returning.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Nonetheless...we still have two Servants at our disposal. The plan will proceed without issue.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What plan?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Well now, I&#39;m surprised he didn&#39;t tell you. Or perhaps you haven&#39;t come in contact yet?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> But you must have heard from Assassin. Or did you dismiss it as nonsense?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> The plan to destroy the planet...?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> So you do know.</p><hr><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> It is just as you imagine, Fujimaru. Our goal is nothing less than the complete and total annihilation of this planet.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Do you think it impossible? I assure you, it is well within my capability.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I firmly believe that, and so do those who follow me.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> The world will end in the year 1999. What was once fanciful nonsense will become harsh reality.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Why would you do something like that!?</p><hr><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Ah yes, my motive. Hmm...</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I suppose it&#39;s because I&#39;m a mathematician. I have calculated the power needed to destroy the planet.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> So why wouldn&#39;t I want to test my equation to see if it was correct?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I see you&#39;re having trouble accepting my reason. I suppose I can&#39;t blame you.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> But, this is simply what it is to be a mathematician. I am proud to be evil, and despise those who defy me.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> But...I would prefer Chaldea not interfere. If I killed you, they&#39;d just send another Master.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> So let&#39;s make a deal, Fujimaru. I shall send you back to Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> In return, Chaldea leaves us alone.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I could never do that!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Of course you could. Just ask Leonardo da Vinci to explain the situation to you later.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I can&#39;t do that.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Perhaps you&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> However...I believe a genius of Leonardo da Vinci&#39;s caliber should soon realize just what the destruction of the planet truly signifies.</p><hr><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> At any rate, feel free to take your time and think it over. There&#39;s no reason to kill you any time soon.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> Damn, talk about having the devil&#39;s own luck! You&#39;re a hell of a [\u2642 guy /\u2640 gal], you know that?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> Anyway, you just sit tight for a while, all right? I know, why don&#39;t you keep him company?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> He&#39;s the kind of guy who goes nuts without someone around anyway. He&#39;ll be happy to talk to you!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Why, if it isn&#39;t the wonderful Master of Chaldea! It&#39;s me, William Shakespeare! It has been quite some time, no?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What&#39;s with those chains!?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> I&#39;m told they&#39;re specifically designed to hold Servants! As a Caster, there&#39;s little I can do about them!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...Are you the mastermind?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Of course not! Surely you can see these accursed chains keeping me here!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Though I suppose I can&#39;t blame you for being suspicious, given how I look!</p><hr><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> The truth is, when they captured me, they spent the whole day torturing me.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> \u201CSweet are the uses of adversity\u201D my foot!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Ahh, it&#39;s horrible.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> Oh yeah, Shakespeare&#39;s totally telling the truth there!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> He only agreed to make King Lears for us recently, after he was tortured!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Hahaha. I&#39;m just glad I could be of service,you piece of dung!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> How about I torture you even more painfully next time, and you make a...hmm...How about Macbeth!?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> That guy was immortal, right? Great! Can&#39;t wait to get started!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> ...A fine mess, this is. At any rate, I&#39;m surprised to see you here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> How can we escape?</p><hr><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Unfortunately, as you can see, I&#39;m not in much of a position to be of any assistance in that regard.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> While you may not be similarly restrained, as a human,I&#39;m afraid it would be difficult for you too.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> There are many Hornets patrolling the grounds, along with the multitude of King Lears I have been forced to create.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> At least I&#39;ve finally just about run out of sentences praising or decrying the latter.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Ahh, I&#39;m so sorry, [\u2642 Sir /\u2640 Miss] Fujimaru! If only I hadn&#39;t written so many historical masterpieces...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Glad to see you&#39;re still you!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Hm?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> I must say I&#39;m curious why you are gazing at me so fondly, but I&#39;m glad to see you in good health!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That&#39;s just like you.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Hahaha. Is that supposed to be a compliment?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> If not, I shall take it as one anyway!</p><hr><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Still, from what little I heard, it was quite the foolish escapade\u2013your being captured and all.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Oh, I&#39;m not being critical of you, [\u2642 Sir /\u2640 Miss] Fujimaru. I&#39;m talking about the Archer of Shinjuku.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> It would be foolish to believe he didn&#39;t have at least some idea of the Assassin of Shinjuku&#39;s ability.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> But in that case, why wouldn&#39;t he be wary of Hassan, after he appeared out of nowhere?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That IS strange.</p><hr><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Well then, why don&#39;t we look at this from a new angle, yes? As a detective might.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> If it makes no sense for him to have believed that Hassan was who he claimed, then perhaps he was aware of his true identity all along?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> At first glance, this would appear to be a betrayal on his part.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s not...I think.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> He must be quite the Servant for you to trust him so implicitly.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> There&#39;s no need for that.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> True. Nor has he made a move since your abduction.</p><hr><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Hmm...I don&#39;t suppose he entrusted anything to you? Say, a letter?</p><p><strong>F\uFF1AAssassin of Shinjuku:</strong> You&#39;re doing great, Master! I hope you know that!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Huh, guess he did.</p><hr><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Excellent.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Then let us see what he had to say! ...Hmm...</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> \u201CDon&#39;t worry, your life is not in danger. \u201D\u201CHelp is sure to come. \u201D</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> \u201CWhen it does, they will explain everything. \u201D\u201CMy deepest apologies for frightening you. \u201D</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> ...That&#39;s all it says.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> So he may not have betrayed you, but there are still many questions remaining.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> ...Perhaps I can answer them.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Who goes there!?</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> My name is Edmond Dant\xE8s. Some call me the Count of Monte Cristo.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> The Count of Monte Cristo!?</p><hr><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Keep your voice low, Fujimaru. The Archer of Shinjuku sent me to help you.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Or rather, he set me up so that I would have no choice. At any rate, we need to hurry.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Shakespeare, I wish I could rescue you too, but I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll have to leave you behind.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Ahh, what a tragedy! Though I do understand your position.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> But...</p><hr><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> No no, it&#39;s quite all right.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> I may be subjected to more torture, but I doubt they&#39;ll kill me for a while yet.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Right now, your safety is of the utmost importance, [\u2642 Sir /\u2640 Miss] Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Worry not about me! But, do come rescue me later, when you can.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> I know. Good luck, Shakespeare.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> And to you!</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> It seems we&#39;ve been found out. Hurry, Master. And don&#39;t worry.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> This security is a mere trifle for me!</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Uh oh. Here comes a King Lear.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Shakespeare, why did you have to go and write these things into existence!?</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Sorry, Master, but I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m not at my best right now. I hope you can figure a way out of this!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Phew. Looks like our escape was a success.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Oh, but don&#39;t try to contact Chaldea just yet. The enemy is likely using the signal to track us.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> So I think it&#39;s better if I continue to jam it for the time being.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Can I ask you something?</p><hr><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> What is it, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Who are you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You&#39;re not the Count of Monte Cristo.</p><hr><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> ...Remarkable!</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> You are absolutely correct. I am not the proud vengeance-seeker at all.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> And believe me, I was well aware of it during that battle.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> But how did you figure it out?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> He hates being called Edmond Dant\xE8s.</p><hr><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Now I see. I knew I couldn&#39;t fool you for long, Master!</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> I went to a bit of effort to change my speech patterns, you see.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> I wondered if I might have been giving too much away,but even so, you did well to notice! Good show!</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> All right, let&#39;s dispense with this disguise then, shall we.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I believe this is the first we&#39;ve met since Camelot,[\u2642 Mr. /\u2640 Ms. ] Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Holmes!</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Pity your well-read friend Ms. Kyrielight isn&#39;t here to join us, but I suppose there&#39;s nothing for it now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> How did you get here?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Good question. Let me start from the beginning.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Do you remember when we met at the Atlas Institute? ...Yes, it appears you do.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Well, there is a reason I continued to Rayshift from London, to Camelot, to Shinjuku.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> You didn&#39;t need my help to restore humanity. I suppose I could have offered advice, but so could others.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> But the same was not true for the incident that would happen afterwards.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> At the Atlas Institute, I was trying to find out if one thing in particular was possible.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Whether or not a Singularity could occur after humanity had been completely restored.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Huh!?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> It turns out that such a thing was very possible indeed.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Tri-Hermes warned that if humanity were to move from being incinerated to being restored...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> This distorted history would end up creating enormous remnants.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Specifically, remnants of numerous powers that could have threatened the entire world, but were wiped out by history playing out correctly.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> To date, the Counter Force, or perhaps something else, has worked to restrain or dispose of these remnants before they could pose a threat, but...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> When humanity moves towards restoration, their power returns from the cracks of history.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> They&#39;re almost like hidden malware that tries to infect your computer when you go to reboot it.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Anyway, Tri-Hermes calculated that if a new remnant were to occur, it would be here in 1999 Shinjuku.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I still don&#39;t know why, but...there is one strong possibility.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What&#39;s that?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> No, I&#39;d better not say anything until I know for certain. Now now, don&#39;t give me that look!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Watson used to give me that exact look. At any rate, that is why I am here.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Now, what say we keep going, [\u2642 Mr. /\u2640 Ms. ] Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Oh yes, I still have to tell you the most important thing of all.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I am not completely confident that I have laid bare all the mysteries Shinjuku hides.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Hahaha! Words fail you, I see.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Indeed, ordinarily I would never divulge a theory that I was still in the middle of formulating.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Doing so could cause you all to make errant predictions, potentially leading to grave mistakes.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> However, there is an exception to every rule, and this case is one such exception.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> The reason is simple: his fingerprints are all over it.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Threads that should lead to him become tangled and twisted, eventually ensnaring you in a trap.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> And before you know it, he has you in his grasp, just where he wants you.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> However, there is only so much one can see by observing a spider&#39;s nest from above.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> And if one takes too long to investigate, the wind could blow away the evidence like so much sand.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Thus, I have chosen to leap into the spider&#39;s web headfirst. Perhaps that&#39;s what he wanted all along: for me to take the stage.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> ...I imagine if Ms. Kyrielight were here, she would be screaming right about now.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> At any rate! Let me tell you exactly who we are up against.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> My nemesis. A demonic mastermind who disappears without a trace of evidence.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> He and his subordinates spin threads, each of which leads to the spider lying in wait.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> In order to reach him, I had to evade every one of these threads, sometimes disguising myself entirely.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> However, I soon learned that even this wasn&#39;t enough to find evidence that could convict him.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> In time, I began referring to him as\u201Cthe Napoleon of crime. \u201D</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> But his real name...is James Moriarty.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> He and the Archer of Shinjuku who first bonded with you when you arrived here...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> ...are one and the same.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> That is why I hesitated to reveal myself. Moriarty would never side with good and virtue.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> It must be some sort of plot...Regardless, I knew my presence would only endanger you.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> The moment I arrived in Shinjuku, I could sense that he was here.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> As such, there is little doubt that he is similarly aware of me.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Given how weak the good Moriarty&#39;s Spirit Origin is...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I didn&#39;t think the same would apply to him. However...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> It seems that over the course of deducing his True Name, he&#39;s managed to sniff out my presence.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> That being the case, there is no point in my pretending to be the Count of Monte Cristo.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> And now that I have removed my disguise, the game is well and truly afoot. No longer am I a spectator; I am a participant.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Which means that it is now only a matter of time before Moriarty and I face each other.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> In truth, I did all I could to remove any mention of him in Watson&#39;s writings.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> In part, that was because, if possible, I wished to fight him on my own.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> But the other part is that I instructed Watson to write about him as little as was possible.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> In terms of pure strength, there are surely countless Servants who surpass him.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> No doubt there are also many who exceed him in charisma, especially those from the Age of Gods.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> But when it comes to evil charisma\u2013devising fiendish plans that are carried out without requiring him to lift a finger\u2013he is in a class of his own.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> ...Indeed, I feared what effect Moriarty might have on the world. Thus, I asked Watson to depict him as simply and austerely as possible.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Now, here is the real problem: Moriarty claims to have split into good and bad personas.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> The bad one took the power and True Name, and expelled the good one from his domain.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> However, as I see it, this just doesn&#39;t add up.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> After all...I had sensed almost no traces of good from him.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> And yet, the Archer of Shinjuku who protected you was sincere in his actions.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> When he saved you from the fearsome Rider of Shinjuku, he did so with no regard for his own life.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Nor did it seem like he did so because he had some scheme in mind that would guarantee his survival.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Sheer dumb luck was the only reason he survived.... When I realized that, I was utterly at a loss.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So Archer is Moriarty...</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I thought he might be an impostor, but that doesn&#39;t seem to be the case. Which leaves us with a problem.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> He really is a good Moriarty. It&#39;s almost like one of those protagonists suffering from amnesia.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> This really is a problem!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I&#39;d never believed such a person could even exist in this world!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Still, while your life may not be in danger, I can&#39;t say I approve of the way he let you get abducted.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> He let me what!?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Well, you would likely have been abducted at some point anyway. And he knew I would rescue you too.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Why that little...!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> You have every right to be angry. Good or not, that part of him is still very much Moriarty.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> If he calculates a gambit will be safe, then he will go through with it, no matter how risky it may actually be.</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Now then, I advise you not to try and hide anything from him. Feel free to tell him all about this talk.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I know you&#39;re concerned, but don&#39;t worry. He already knows everything that&#39;s happened.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> He knew you would get kidnapped, meet his other self, and that I would rescue you.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> He even knew that his True Name would be revealed afterwards, along with the doubts I still harbor.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Naturally, he&#39;s never met me in person. But he is certain nonetheless.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Even if he doesn&#39;t know his True Name, he will have sufficient information to deduce it.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> That is something Moriarty would never fail to do.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> In that sense, we are very much alike.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> At any rate, once everyone is here, I have something else to tell you.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> ...Exactly what destroying the world really means.</p><p><strong>Affluent Person:</strong> I say, you there.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Uh...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Me?</p><hr><p><strong>Affluent Person:</strong> Yes, you. What a lovely face you have...I daresay your complexion is marvelous.</p><p><strong>Affluent Person:</strong> You&#39;re the very picture of health. You must be highly nutritious.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Uh...what?</p><hr><p><strong>Affluent Person:</strong> Now, should I go with rare, or well-done...Ahh, I can never decide.</p><p><strong>Affluent Person:</strong> Heh. Hehe. Hahahaha! Steak! Steeeak!</p><p><strong>Affluent Person:</strong> The wealthy like me are meant to eat fine steaks! Commoners are supposed to eat swine!</p><p><strong>Affluent Person:</strong> One of my stature can&#39;t eat swine! That would mean you healthy people are more affluent than me!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Hahaha, I see someone&#39;s at the end of their rope.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Why is everyone here like this!?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> There have been severe food shortages here ever since Shinjuku fell into this state.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Of course, now there is one source of food that remains in abundance.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> After all, most good people here are dead and gone. Those that remain are either spellcasters or killers.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> So, on that note, [\u2642 Mr. /\u2640 Ms. ] Fujimaru,I hope I can count on your help.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Fortunately, these should be easier than that King Lear. Of course, there are also a lot more of them!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Hmm, I had better stock up on weapons soon. I believe he should be around here.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1ARuffian:</strong> Huh? What&#39;re you lookin&#39; at, punk?</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Ah, there you are. I see you&#39;re just as bad at disguising yourself as ever.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1ARuffian:</strong> ...How do you always see through it?</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> It doesn&#39;t matter how much you change your appearance if your gait remains the same.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Ruffians, police officers, yakuza...Each has their own distinct way of walking.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> [\u2642 Mr. /\u2640 Ms. ] Fujimaru, allow me to introduce you. This is Mr. Kaburagi.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> He runs a general store here in Shinjuku.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> He has everything from Demonic Beast corpses to guns that will even work on wraiths.</p><p><strong>Kaburagi:</strong> Mr. Dant\xE8s here is one of my best customers. It&#39;s always a pleasure to see him.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Hmm. You should try to sound a little more earnest when you lie.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Aha, I see what&#39;s going on.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Today I&#39;m here with someone who seems like they&#39;d make a good hostage, so you were hoping to abduct them in order to threaten me! Isn&#39;t that right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Wait, what!?</p><hr><p><strong>Kaburagi:</strong> Haha, I can&#39;t put anything past you! Well, now you&#39;ve seen through it, I won&#39;t give you any trouble!</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Good. Now, I&#39;ll take twenty of the usual, please.</p><p><strong>Kaburagi:</strong> You got it. By the way, Mr. Dant\xE8s,I&#39;ve got a question for ya.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> And what might that be?</p><p><strong>Kaburagi:</strong> Do you think the end is almost here?</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Hmm...Yes, it may well be.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> But that doesn&#39;t change what needs to be done, does it? You still have to collect, sort, and sell your wares.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> It may not be a proud profession. At times, you may have to sully your hands.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> But so what? What is there to be afraid of?</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> You should be proud, Mr. Kaburagi. Just do what you need to.</p><p><strong>Kaburagi:</strong> I&#39;ll keep that in mind. By the by, I also have some new Demonic Beasts in, if you fancy that?</p><p><strong>Kaburagi:</strong> They could make great pets. They&#39;re very friendly, and not a bit picky when it comes to food!</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> No thanks.</p><p><strong>Kaburagi:</strong> What about you, young [\u2642 man /\u2640 lady]! Interested in a nice Demonic Beast?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Fou&#39;s all I need, thanks.</p><p><strong>Kaburagi:</strong> Do my ears deceive me!? You say you already have a Demonic Beast for a pet?</p><p><strong>Kaburagi:</strong> What sort of beast? Is it the kind that would kill a dreamy-eyed Caster on sight?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What kind of beast ya got?</p><p><strong>Kaburagi:</strong> A genetically modified Chimera. I call it a Super Chimera myself.</p><p><strong>Kaburagi:</strong> ...What? You don&#39;t need one? You had a bad experience with one before?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Thanks for waiting!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Hey, you&#39;re...you.</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Yes. We&#39;ll soon be meeting up with the others, after all.... I believe her hideout was somewhere around here.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Ah, there we go. All right, shall we go get lectured?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> L-lectured?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> But of course, [\u2642 Mr. /\u2640 Ms. ] Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I&#39;m afraid those two will be absolutely livid after spending the evening worrying so much about you.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Hahaha, I see you now understand the situation we&#39;re in. Come then, let us be off!</p><h2 id="section-11-great-detective-work" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-11-great-detective-work" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 11: Great Detective Work</h2><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> ...Here we are. Now, to reestablish contact.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Master! Are you all right!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> You okay there!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master! Thank goodness you&#39;re safe!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I mean, I could tell you were okay because I was monitoring your status, but...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We haven&#39;t been able to contact you this whole time!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hey there. Everyone in one piece? ...Wait, Sherlock Holmes!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Ah!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It really is you!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Good to see you again, Ms. Kyrielight.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You too, Mr. Holmes. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re in good\u2013Wait, what are you doing there with Master!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> He rescued me.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Is that so. How wonderful.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Then you could have contacted us at any point up till now, instead of showing up unannounced.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> So, you were with this suspicious man all this time.... I see.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;m all right.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Well good! Great! Isn&#39;t that just fan-freaking-tastic!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> So who&#39;s this guy? Holmes? What good&#39;s a detective gonna do here?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Allow me to introduce myself once again. My name is Sherlock Holmes.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I&#39;m technically a Caster, but I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t be of much help in battle. Please do forgive me.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> So you&#39;re dead weight, huh. Whatever. Anyway, thanks for saving our dumbass Master.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Now...Get lost!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t do that. All right, Archer of Shinjuku...I think it&#39;s time you came out now.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Hi there, Holmes. It&#39;s been a while, hasn&#39;t it old boy? Wonderful to see you again! Well, bye then!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> ...What do you think you&#39;re doing?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Well...When you were taken, I had planned out what I thought to be the best course of action.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> But with the benefit of hindsight, I suppose it really was rather dangerous, having me involved...</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I feel awful about it. You must have been very scared. I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is...</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Well, uh...I&#39;m sorry.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Not good enough.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> You are right, of course.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I truly am sorry, though.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> For what it&#39;s worth, those two gave me quite the thrashing for it.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> My face and chest are still smarting from it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Apologizing only goes so far.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Hmm, I suppose you&#39;re right. Very well then, seeing as we&#39;re in Japan...</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I suppose I must atone with seppuku! It is, I hear, quite excruciating.</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Hahahaha! What a funny criminal gentleman you are!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Not to worry. It seems [\u2642 Mr. /\u2640 Ms. ] Fujimaru has already forgiven you.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> [\u2642 He /\u2640 She] has!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Well, more or less.</p><hr><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Oh thank you, thank you! You are too kind!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> He&#39;s right, Master. You are being too kind.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> The more you let this evil bastard get away with, the further he&#39;ll try to take things.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Heh. Jealous? Green REALLY isn&#39;t your color, you know.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> My my, this little kitten certainly likes to mew. But she still needs to be housebroken.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> This kitty has claws, bitch, so watch out.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Thanks for worrying about me, you two.</p><hr><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...I wasn&#39;t overly concerned.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...Huh? Worried? About what!?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> At any rate...Archer of Shinjuku, it seems your memory remains incomplete.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Nonetheless, you must have some idea of who you are, and what you were, by now.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Well, yes.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Considering all these hints that have been dropped, and given how wary I am towards you, there&#39;s only one person in the world I could be.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You&#39;re wary of Mr. Holmes? You don&#39;t mean you&#39;re...!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Please refrain from saying anything further,Ms. Kyrielight.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Let&#39;s wait for him to say it of his own accord.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Yes, well...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> As you have deduced, I do indeed know your True Name, and have already told [\u2642 Mr. /\u2640 Ms. ] Fujimaru as well.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> At this point, [\u2642 he /\u2640 she] is just waiting for you to come clean and tell [\u2642 him /\u2640 her] yourself.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> ...I see. So you really know who I am?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I do.</p><hr><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Very well then, Fujimaru\u2013I mean, Master.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> If you will forgive my transgressions, I shall entrust you with my True Name.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> ...Of course, there may not be much point now that Holmes has told you what it is, but no matter.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> After all, I&#39;m told this ritual is still quite necessary!</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> ...All right then.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AMoriarty:</strong> My name is James Moriarty. I materialized here as a Phantom Spirit composite fusion.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AMoriarty:</strong> I wish to form a contract with you, as your Servant, that I may devote to you my full power!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Anyway, that&#39;s me, Moriarty. A pleasure to be here.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...Just when I thought he couldn&#39;t get any more suspicious. Master, you should banish him for good.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Yeah, he reminds me of one of those cunning foxes that show up in morality tales.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> If only. He is far worse than any fox.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> He never risks his own life. He only makes plans, leaving the dirty work to his subordinates.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> What an absolutely despicable villain.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s right. Even in Dr. Watson&#39;s books, Moriarty was renowned for his villainy.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> And at the Reichenbach Falls, he and Mr. Holmes faced off against one another directly!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Which ended with both plunging down the waterfall.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Please be careful, Master. Are you sure there are no waterfalls nearby!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Pretty sure.</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Ahh...It pains me to see you so wary of me, Mash. (Sniff)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, uh...Th-that was just my impression of you from Dr. Watson&#39;s writings, so...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I do think you&#39;re, uh...not too bad? Or at least, I think I do...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Pay him no heed, Ms. Kyrielight. He&#39;s only pretending to cry.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> You cad! Have you no mercy!?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Hahaha. For you, Moriarty...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I will never show mercy when it comes to foiling your plans.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Well, can&#39;t blame you for that!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Now then, I believe you have some information for us, Holmes?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Ah yes, about destroying this planet. In brief...It is entirely possible.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Wait, what!? How can that actually be possible!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Earth has a number of safety provisions in place. He can&#39;t possibly circumvent all of them.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Right you are.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> During the course of this planet&#39;s unbroken history, it has withstood numerous crises.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Barring the sudden appearance of alien visitors...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> ...it is extremely unlikely that those of us who were born here could manage to truly destroy it.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Thus, in order to do so, one must completely overturn one&#39;s most basic preconceptions.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> In other words...what the Lion King attempted to do in the Holy City, and what Edison attempted to accomplish using the Holy Grail&#39;s power.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The Lion King...and Edison!?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...Aha, now I see! So that&#39;s what foolish nonsense I&#39;m up to!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Ugh, that&#39;s just like me!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I understand! I understand all too well what I&#39;m thinking!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Then how &#39;bout letting the rest of us in on it!? What&#39;d this Lion King and Edison person try to do!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Well...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The Lion King made his sacred lance into a tower, and planned to use it to wipe out all of humanity save for a select few.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> However, even if he had succeeded in wiping them out, the Incineration of Humanity was happening at the time, so he expected that their salvation would soon be forthcoming.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> It was a shallow, ill-conceived plan, but it was also the result of much agonizing.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> What an idiot. In that case, he should&#39;ve just let himself die along with everyone else.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> This is why I hate kings who charge ahead trying to solve everything by themselves. Of course, I hate kings who just roll over without putting up a fight even more.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> As for Mr. Edison...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> He didn&#39;t actually end up doing anything, but he did come up with an idea.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> He said that once he won the Holy Grail, he planned to cut America out of history altogether.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> So we have the Lion King, who was trying to save a handful of people...even if it meant the destruction of the outside world...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> And Edison, who tried to cut his country off from the outside world in order to preserve it forever.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hmm. Hmm? Hang on. That would mean...Aha! Now I see!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> So that&#39;s his plan!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Da Vinci!?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Figured it out already, eh? I see your reputation as a genius artist is well deserved.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hang on just a moment! I need to look something up!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Quick! All staff, gather round! We need to begin an emergency investigation!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> So what is this plan already?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> ...It&#39;s not possible to destroy the world.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Goetia&#39;s objective may have been different, but his plan still took 3,000 years to come to fruition.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> However, it IS possible to remove the world from history. In other words...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> If the world is removed from history...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Then it can be destroyed?</p><hr><p><strong>Both:</strong> Well done!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yes! That&#39;s exactly it! This is terrible! That world is already devoid of meaning!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Wh-what do you mean, Da Vinci!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I mean that world is already cut off from history!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> No matter what happens there in Shinjuku, it won&#39;t have any effect on humanity whatsoever!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I mean, of course it can make things a bit unstable, but no more than the tiniest of tremors.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> No matter how unstable humanity gets, at this level, there will never be any adverse effects.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> In the worst case, that Shinjuku could be destroyed without issue...It wouldn&#39;t even affect Chaldea!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So this world is going to be destroyed?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...Unless we can find a way to avert it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What about the Servants...?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Naturally, if the world is destroyed, they&#39;ll disappear along with it. However...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Since their Spirit Origin information won&#39;t be lost, we&#39;ll still be able to resummon them.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Wait, we&#39;re forgetting the most important thing: what will happen to Master?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...That&#39;s the crux of it.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Basically, everything else hangs on exactly how we bring Fujimaru home.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> However!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> If that world is already cut off from history, we may be able to force a Rayshift!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> If we can, that would solve everything!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Yes, that all sounds right, but...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> ...Hm.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Yes, that IS how it would play out, isn&#39;t it.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Shinjuku would remain a hellpit, and be destroyed alongside this planet by my other self.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s terrible!</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Now now, hear me out. Yes, Shinjuku, the world, we Servants...That would all be gone.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> But if you make it back to Chaldea, in effect, nothing would be lost.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I mean, yes, we will lose our lives! But in the end, this Shinjuku would simply revert to oblivion.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;re wrong!</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I knew you would say that, [\u2642 Mr. /\u2640 Ms. ] Fujimaru. What do you think, Ms. Kyrielight?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...As a Servant, I would like to place the highest importance on my Master&#39;s life.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That said...and this may be rather impudent of me, but...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> If Master were to return here to safety, and abandon Shinjuku to its doom...Well...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It just wouldn&#39;t be like [\u2642 him /\u2640 her].</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I knew you&#39;d understand, Mash!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> N-not at all! Please, just forget I said anything.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I can&#39;t bear to have you in danger, so I&#39;ll look for a way to Rayshift you home.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;m glad you&#39;re my Servant!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I...Thank you, Master. I&#39;m glad you still think of me that way.</p><hr><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...Hm.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Hmm.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...Jealous?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Now now, don&#39;t go kicking another beehive.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Yes, good point. For a moment, I was deathly afraid for my life.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Now then...As a representative of Chaldea, I can&#39;t just let Fujimaru share Shinjuku&#39;s fate.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> [\u2642 He /\u2640 She] has fought alongside us for a full year now. We won&#39;t let [\u2642 him /\u2640 her] throw [\u2642 his /\u2640 her] life away.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> However, as a Master, we also wish to respect [\u2642 his /\u2640 her] wish to save Shinjuku.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> So I&#39;ll ask you just one more time, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...There is no point in saving this Shinjuku.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Doing so would help neither humanity nor the people here still worth protecting, if any even exist.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It wouldn&#39;t even be a problem if the Servants you have met here were to vanish.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> This may sound callous, but abandoning Shinjuku would not endanger the restoration of humanity in the slightest.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The Servants who are there with you now would never blame you for making such a choice.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> So, even taking all of that into consideration...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Do you still believe this Shinjuku is worth saving?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I do.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...I see. Well, that does indeed sound like you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I don&#39;t know.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You don&#39;t know, but you want to save it anyway. Ugh...What a headache, but it&#39;s very you!</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Anyway, that&#39;s a relief!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Even though you&#39;ve now saved a world or two, you&#39;re still just as caring, optimistic, and possessed of an indomitable fighting spirit as ever!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> All right then, I guess that settles it. You&#39;ll have Chaldea&#39;s full support!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Of course, that doesn&#39;t mean we won&#39;t also lay the groundwork for a forced Rayshift to bring you home.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> All right then, now that you&#39;ve made your decision, I suppose I had better tell you something else!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Does this new thing you have to tell us have anything to do with why you&#39;ve been so nervous?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Well, if [\u2642 Mr. /\u2640 Ms. ] Fujimaru had decided to go home, there wouldn&#39;t have been any point in sharing this other truth.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I shall now tell you how the culprit\u2013the evil Moriarty\u2013plans on destroying the planet.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> It is true that with the world divided, Earth&#39;s safeguards would fail to work.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Nonetheless, destroying the entire planet should remain utterly unfathomable.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> No matter how great his control over Shinjuku may be, it is not enough to destroy the world.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> In which case, Moriarty...what do you think you would need to make such destruction possible?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Hmm.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> To destroy the planet...one would need enough energy to match that scale.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> That energy would then need to be focused toward the earth&#39;s core...a central destruction point.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Naturally, this is far easier said than done. The sheer amount of energy required for such a task is incomprehensibly massive.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> For example...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> A meteor. A meteor falling to Earth would easily meet such energy requirements.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> But of course, there is no reliable way to predict such an occurrence.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Such a thing may generate the requisite energy, but it would not be possible for it to hit the necessary target.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> In which case, the next thing one would need is a device designed to draw in a passing meteor and direct its impact to the desired coordinates.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...A gun barrel.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So...you mean something that could load and fire a meteor like a bullet?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Barrel...?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Indeed. Remember, Master? That mysterious tower that stands on Shinjuku&#39;s western edge.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> The one growing taller by the day, as if it were trying to pierce the heavens themselves.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> That is the device Moriarty will need to complete his plan.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Wait...What!? That building is an actual gun barrel!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But...it doesn&#39;t even move! How could something like that possibly load a meteor like a bullet!?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> A Phantom Spirit...</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> A Phantom Spirit...? What does a spirit that failed to become a Heroic Spirit have to do with this?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Indeed. I too was puzzled by why Moriarty was so focused on Phantom Spirits.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> But upon re-reading his book, \u201CThe Dynamics of an Asteroid,\u201D I finally understood.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> He plans to control a meteor using his Servant abilities.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> That is why he needs a Phantom Spirit&#39;s power. The power to hit a target, no matter the circumstances.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Thus! The Phantom Spirit he has summoned is none other than Der Freisch\xFCtz: Max, the Freeshooter.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> A hunter who made a deal with the devil for seven magical bullets. That is who Moriarty has absorbed!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Six of his seven bullets will always hit their mark, regardless of the obstacles in their path.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> In other words, he has no control over the seventh and final bullet.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> And that&#39;s not all.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> This ability is more about hitting targets than actually hurting them.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Thus, this Phantom Spirit is usually relegated to nothing more than a character in an opera.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> That is what Moriarty is taking advantage of.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Now I see...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> That explains why I was summoned as an Archer, and not a Caster...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> And why I&#39;m able to fire bullets and missiles from this coffin I never used when I was alive...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> And you couldn&#39;t have figured that out sooner!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Jeanne Alter makes an excellent point.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Hahaha, sorry about that!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I imagine that must be some of the knowledge I lost during the split.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Remember the time limit I mentioned earlier,[\u2642 Mr. /\u2640 Ms. ] Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Once the tower is complete, it won&#39;t be long before a meteor comes our way.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Once it does, it will jump into the Barrel...and be fired into the planet. Voil\xE0! A magical bullet.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Which, if Moriarty&#39;s theory is correct, will result in the murder of Earth itself.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> The most heinous crime committed throughout all of history...A massacre on an unprecedented scale.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Ah, you flatter me...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That wasn&#39;t a compliment.</p><hr><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Idiot.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...At any rate, regardless of whether this plan is feasible, we are certain it is what the League of Phantom Fiends is working towards, correct?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Indubitably.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...I know it&#39;s filthy rich coming from me, seeing as I tried to destroy France and all, but...yikes.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> I mean, that&#39;d kill all of them too.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Indeed it would. Though of course, thinking logically, a Servant can never truly die.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Nonetheless, if they are still aiding in the world&#39;s destruction, they are likely doing so for pleasure, revenge, or some other unknown purpose.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Thus, their role is to build an enormous wall, overrun Shinjuku, and guard the Barrel.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> So, if we wish to save Shinjuku, our first step must be to neutralize the Assassin of Shinjuku.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Indeed. That transformation ability is quite formidable.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> If left unchecked, I may well end up cutting down Jeanne Alter by mistake.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Try it, ice bitch queen. I dare you. But yeah, I agree;that guy pisses me off, and we should kill him. Soon.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> So, how do we do that?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Now then, Moriarty.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Yes, Holmes? What do you want from me, now that you&#39;ve robbed me of my job of explaining things?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> That&#39;s what you&#39;re upset about?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> At any rate, I want you to come up with a plan. That is what you excel at, isn&#39;t it? Scheming?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I may excel at foiling plans, but when it comes to crafting them, you are no doubt my better.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> So that&#39;s how it is. In that case, I&#39;ll need information.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Give me everything you have on the enemy, including their dealings with external entities.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Very well. Here you are.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Aha, interesting...Now I see...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Hmm, if we do this, followed by that...Although...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Hmm...What we really need is sexiness.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Did you just say \u201Csexiness\u201D?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> But of course! It&#39;s absolutely crucial!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Did I just hear what I think I heard?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Hm? It must be your imagination! My plan is foolproof!</p><hr><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...Are you certain about this?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Moriarty&#39;s plans may appear nonsensical, but in hindsight, they nearly always work out well.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I understand your concerns, but I think it&#39;s worth rolling the dice on.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> All right then, everyone, we&#39;re off to the city to buy clothes! And by buy, I of course mean steal.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>All Three:</strong></p><p>What!?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...Are you sure this will work?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Oh yes, without a doubt. As for you, Holmes, I shall let you land the final blow.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Good grief. I know this was my idea, but your plan is exceptionally reckless...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Master, just to make sure, is it all right with you to proceed with my plan?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m not thrilled about this, but...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Naturally, the particulars will need to be adjusted on the fly. But the crucial will not change.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> We must assassinate the Assassin of Shinjuku.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What other choice do we have?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Indubitably.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I agree it&#39;s rather reckless, but it also makes full use of everything we bring to the table.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I trust it will work out.</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Okay, let&#39;s get started. It&#39;s dress-up time!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> But first, go ahead and clear out those ruffians and brainwashed Coloraturas.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> What&#39;s that? They refuse to leave? Makes sense! In that case, it&#39;s battle time!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Right then, everyone! What say we get changed, go out there, and raise hell!?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Changed, eh...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Changed, huh...</p><p><strong>Both:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Okay, I guess I will too.</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Ah, ah, ah, Master. Not so fast. Your outfit...is right here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh!?</p><h2 id="section-12-elegant-dance" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-12-elegant-dance" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 12: Elegant Dance</h2><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Even in a hell like Shinjuku,there is a clearly defined hierarchy.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Those with money can hire people to do violence on their behalf.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The world overflows with money. And with money, one can achieve ultimate glory.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> One can taste foods never before seen; imbibe liquor never before tasted. All with the power of money.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Forget the humiliating past.

Shouldn&#39;t you be off trying to burn France?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Hehehe, sounds like you&#39;re the one in need of burning.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Is that not why you&#39;re here? To burn things?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> What&#39;s this?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> These are the radios the old man gave us. What a pain; I still don&#39;t see why we have to use them.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I believe it would be to all our advantage not to have our magical energy detected, don&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Are you sure it isn&#39;t merely that you distrust magecraft?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Hmm...I suppose that could have something to do with it. I am a modern man top to bottom, after all.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I am of course aware of magecraft, and even account for it in my plans, but I have never delved very deep into it.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Well, I can&#39;t say I&#39;m surprised.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> It was only by ruthlessly targeting that sole bit of humanity you revealed that I was able to close in on you.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> So that&#39;s why you were so friendly with the Mage&#39;s Association back when we were alive. You probably don&#39;t even care for magecraft yourself!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> At any rate, Master, how are you managing?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Why...?</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> What&#39;s the problem? It seems like a perfect disguise to me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Again...WHY...?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Hahaha! Oh Moriarty, that&#39;s not why [\u2642 \u201Cshe\u201D /\u2640 \u201Che\u201D] is upset.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Why do I have to disguise myself as a [\u2642 girl /\u2640 guy]!?</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> The Assassin knows what you look like.

Otherwise, we may all end up in a towering inferno! )</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...All right, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> There are a number of armed men upstairs, most likely bodyguards. He should be here soon.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> The Assassin of Shinjuku always disguises himself when he goes out in public. It almost makes me sorry that he&#39;ll never be able to reveal himself and properly claim the glory he seeks.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Ah, regardless, even if we were to find his base of operations, force our way in, and destroy his Noble Phantasm, he would simply disappear amidst the chaos.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> But, if we have you and your world-class eye for appraising Servants, that changes things!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Some may be surprised to see Servants.

But my sacred sword shall not stand for this.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s no use!</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Let&#39;s not give up just yet, shall we!</p><p><strong>Subordinate A:</strong> What would you like us to do with the money we collected?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> What else? Use some to buy more food and drink for us.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> As for the rest...Let&#39;s take over Kabukicho. Now that Berserker is gone, we can run a store there.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> Give them everything they want, and take everything they have.</p><p><strong>Subordinate A:</strong> I don&#39;t believe they had anything of value worth taking.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> I&#39;m talking about taking three things: pride, love, and courage.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> Ask them whether they&#39;ll crawl on their hands and knees to swear loyalty to us. Entice parents to sell off their kids, and kids to sell off their parents.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> Make it so they never even think about the possibility of defying us.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> That way, everyone&#39;s happy: me, you, the entire world!</p><p><strong>Subordinate A:</strong> Yes, sir.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> Now let&#39;s go out there and grab us some glory!</p><p><strong>Subordinate A:</strong> You know, there are a lot of beautiful women this time. Perhaps we could keep one or two of them?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> Oho, women, hmm? I can&#39;t say I care about that sort of thing myself, but let&#39;s take a look...</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> Hmm...Hmm...</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> Huh!?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> No way! This can&#39;t be right.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> What the hell&#39;s going on!?</p><p><strong>Subordinate A:</strong> Wh-what is it, sir!?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> Don&#39;t \u201CWhat is it, sir!? \u201D me! Take a look at her!</p><p><strong>Subordinate A:</strong> Yes, that&#39;s one of the women I...Huh, you know, she looks just like the face you&#39;re using today, Boss.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> That&#39;s it, you&#39;re dead to me.</p><p><strong>Subordinate A:</strong> Guh...!</p><p><strong>Subordinate B:</strong> Boss!?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> Summon the Hornets. She&#39;s a Servant. We need to take her out now!</p><p><strong>Subordinate B:</strong> Y-yes, Boss!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> And make up some excuse to kick the sponsors out of here. She obviously plans to involve them.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> Like a moth to the flame, eh. Now, get her!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I finally got permission to reopen communications! Master! I just have to say, you look great!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m going to treasure this photo forever!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Please, no! I&#39;m begging you!</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Thank goodness we&#39;re not too late! Now then, let&#39;s start by taking care of these fellows, shall we!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> What say we cut them down to size!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> Tch! Send in more reinforcements!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> Send in the Coloraturas too! Did the sponsors leave yet? Good! Don&#39;t worry about the rest!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> Send in the newly made S. P. ! I hear they cause lots of collateral damage, but y&#39;know, beggars and choosers!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> ...Wait. She&#39;s here too!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m picking up a new enemy signal. Be careful, Master!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> What the...? Something&#39;s weird about this.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> My beloved you!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> My beloved me!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Now we shall be as one for all of time, where death&#39;s cold grasp can never do us part!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Ahh, Romeo!

Whatever you do, don&#39;t let them use their Noble Phantasms!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> Don&#39;t worry! I&#39;ll kill them when the time is right!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I knew it. It won&#39;t work. The Spirit Origin values don&#39;t match the last ones!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We know the Assassin of Shinjuku is among these dozens of people, but we can&#39;t tell which one.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> No matter. As long as he is among the crowd, our plan will work.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Now, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Here goes!</p><hr><p><strong>A\uFF1AAssassin of Shinjuku:</strong> Huh!?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AHornet:</strong> ...?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AAssassin of Shinjuku:</strong> The Master from Chaldea!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You!</p><hr><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> There you are, Assassin!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> Dammit! I can&#39;t believe I fell for such a cheap trick!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I am sure you meant to say \u201Cdevilishly cunning trap,\u201D young man!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> All right, now that we&#39;re inside, Assassin has nowhere to run! This is our chance to deal with him!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;ve marked the Assassin of Shinjuku as the target! Please concentrate your attacks on him!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> Tch. Oh well, I knew this day would come eventually. I couldn&#39;t get off scot-free forever!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> It just happened a little sooner\u2013or is that later? \u2013than I thought it would.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> I can&#39;t complain. For that matter, I haven&#39;t even lost yet!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> All right everyone, get out there, fight, and die! Die for my sake, and for yours! But mostly mine!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> Die for glory and desire! My star is the Skillful Star!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> I am Yan Qing, one of the 108 Stars of Destiny! Prepare yourself!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Ngh...!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> You&#39;re mine!</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Dammit! I guess I have no choice!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I&#39;m detecting strong shocks throughout the lower floors of the building!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> A bomb!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You have approximately twenty-three seconds until the building collapses! You two, help Master escape!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Hang on, Master!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> We&#39;re going to jump!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Aaah!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Heeelp!</p><hr><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Stop shouting! It&#39;s irritating, and you&#39;ll bite through your tongue!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Welp, now we&#39;re all gonna die.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Good thing this is happening in this crappy version of Shinjuku, and not somewhere people actually care about.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...Now what became of Holmes and Moriarty? Are they dead? They must be dead.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I am very much alive, thank you! In fact, I&#39;m feeling positively capital!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Hahahaha! I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t afford to die just yet.</p><p><strong>Ruffian:</strong> Eee!</p><p><strong>Hornet:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Citizen:</strong> Wh-what in the world was that...? What&#39;s goingUgh...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Why don&#39;t you tell us your deduction, Moriarty.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Why, it is him, of course.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I concur. Shall we elucidate?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Now then Assassin of Shinjuku, n\xE9e Yan Qing, I&#39;m afraid we can&#39;t let you go now that it&#39;s come to this.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Quite right!</p><p><strong>Citizen:</strong> ...How did you know?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Holmes and I have quite a lot of experience in dueling disguises with one another, you see.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> We hardly need a moment to tell whether or not someone is truly on the brink of death.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I could point out thirteen mistakes you made while pretending to stagger along. But...we have more pressing matters to attend to, don&#39;t we?</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> ...Fine with me. I wouldn&#39;t do anything differently anyway.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> As a proud Star of Destiny, I&#39;m prepared to meet my fate.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> ...Actually, I guess I lost any pride I had a long time ago, so...crap.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Wait, I know! I&#39;ve got a great excuse!</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> After doppelg\xE4nging into so many people, I&#39;ve lost track of who I really am.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Did you know that I keep all of my doppelg\xE4ngers&#39; memories?</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Those ruffians who died over trivial crap...The nouveau riche who exploited others...</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Even Hassan, who kept fighting all by himself here in Shinjuku right up until I killed him.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> They&#39;re all right here, inside my head. Dammit, dammit, dammit!</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> I tried to stop my lord, I really did. But that hopeless fool only said:</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> \u201CDon&#39;t worry, my glory is assured! \u201D</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> ...What a foolish lord. And an equally foolish vassal.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> I should have stopped him, even if it meant killing him. Then he could at least have died without being betrayed.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> And with his heart still full of pride.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Ahh...Whatever happened to my pride...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...The Assassin of Shinjuku&#39;s Spirit Origin has vanished.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Pride, hm? Is such a thing truly necessary to live one&#39;s life?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> How should I know? I&#39;m just a fake. You can throw pride to the dogs for all I care.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Ah, of course. That is just what I&#39;d expect a giant panda lacking in pride to say.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Well excuuuse me for not being proud about\u2013Panda!?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Ah, I see. What with the black and white coloration...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Plus she&#39;s rolling around with bamboo.</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong></p><p>IT&#39;S A FLAAAG!!!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> All right, now that the Assassin of Shinjuku has been dealt with...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> This calls for a night of drinking at Golden Gai!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> I&#39;m exhausted. Let&#39;s go home, Master.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> I&#39;d sooner die than go drinking with you. I&#39;m out of here.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> If we two were to drink, it would just be a matter of time before one of us went full Reichenbach.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...I say, Master.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Perhaps it truly is the case that young people don&#39;t care to go drinking with older gentlemen like myself?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I suppose it could well be construed as a kind of harassment.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> You sound like a manager who&#39;s only just figuring out that his subordinates can&#39;t stand him.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Besides, I&#39;m a minor.</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Oh, right, so you can&#39;t drink at all then. Hmm, very well.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> While my own leanings toward the evil side of the spectrum leave me wishing for nothing more than to initiate Fujimaru into the mysteries of refined spirits...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I shall refrain from doing so, as I can clearly see[\u2642 his /\u2640 her] guardians are rather...protective.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Something you wish to say, Moriarty? If you are prepared to face the consequences, you may speak.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Nope, I&#39;m good.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...Wait. I hear something.</p><p><strong>All:</strong></p><p>!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That howl...!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...Guess who&#39;s back.

It&#39;s solely the faded concept of pure self-interest.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Admittedly, that one ability it has is quite remarkable, but aside from that, it&#39;s mediocre at best.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> It is, after all, a mere scientist. It has a poor physique.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Though that does mean...Very well! This should be interesting. I&#39;ll summon it and fuse you at once.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> But I should warn you. During the operation, make sure your hatred for humans never stops.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> It is the source of your strength.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> And so fervent that it could turn on us, your comrades, in an instant...</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> You have nurtured it, and gone from a Phantom Spirit into a monster capable of killing Heroic Spirits.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> So hate. Loathe. Despise. Otherwise, you will never defeat that Master.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Servants are not human. And in this Shinjuku...</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> ...those who live here merely pretend to be.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> The only true human here...someone who always forges ahead and never gives up...</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> ...is the Master of Chaldea, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Run. Run. Run.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Run as fast as you can, so that no one can take it from you.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> His cold instincts and boiling-hot hatred are his lifeblood; his most potent source of fuel.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> He hates humanity, humans...everything even vaguely associated with people.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> He derives no joy or pleasure from eating them. It only serves to further stoke the flames of his hatred.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> He is no longer a mere beast.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> No longer content with running around vast plains, he has devolved into a monster wholly devoured by his all-consuming need for revenge.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> You may think it sad, but from his perspective, he couldn&#39;t care less.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The only one who would mourn for him is his beloved wife, and he will never see her again.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> \u201CWithout her, what is my purpose? \u201D</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> His heart, his flesh, his fangs, his claws, all call out in response...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Punishment. Absolute punishment. You were the ones who destroyed me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> So I will destroy you as well. I will destroy all of humanity.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I will keep rending and tearing until my fangs break and my claws go dull.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...Ahh, I miss my home in the plains.

I can&#39;t see it!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> How about you, Master!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Something&#39;s here!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I can&#39;t see anything!</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...It seems it&#39;s added another Phantom Spirit. If we&#39;re talking invisibility, there are several possibilities that come to mind...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Siegfried possessed a coat or hat or something\u2013the Tarnkappe, it was called\u2013that rendered things invisible...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> But I think this is more a case of out-and-out invisibility.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I believe that means we&#39;re dealing with the H. G. Wells character. Not that that makes any great difference in terms of the threat it poses.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Uh oh! Its magical energy is increasing! The Rider of Shinjuku is about to show itself!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Look!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...It&#39;s changed. It&#39;s even more horrifying than before.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> It appears its rider has gotten caught up as well. They&#39;re practically of one body now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> This is...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...Well this is just the freakin&#39; worst.</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...Does this bring back memories of Baskerville?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Frankly, no...This is far worse. This creature has cast off any remaining vestiges of the living creature it once was.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Mr. Babbage may be a steel giant, but he is also more human than the heroes or demons of the Age of Gods.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> But not them. It is safe to say that they are well and truly past the point of any biological organism.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> As for the wolf&#39;s headless rider...Hessian, most likely.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Hessian...? I don&#39;t remember any hero by that name.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> A Hessian was not a particular person&#39;s name. It was the title given to German mercenaries who fought in the American Revolutionary War.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So then, he doesn&#39;t even have a name? Even for a Phantom Spirit, that seems awfully cruel.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Ah, but there is exactly one entity who was famed for being a nameless knight without a head.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> He is part of a superstitious tale told every year in America, during Halloween.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Sleepy Hollow!?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That&#39;s it! The Legend of Sleepy Hollow!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> One of the most famous American fairy tales. The Hessian headless horseman!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> But isn&#39;t that Hessian rather oddly...passive, Holmes?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Given his behavior up to this point, it seems he&#39;s simply allowed Lobo to have control.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Which would seem to indicate that Lobo is the true master and the Hessian a mere rider, as we thought.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Still, having a rider also makes it twice as strong. Perhaps even four times, or a hundred.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Wait! The enemy Servant&#39;s Spirit Origin has been altered.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Its...Its class has changed! Its new class is...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Be careful! It&#39;s no longer a Rider! It&#39;s more ferocious than ever...an Avenger!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...Master, get back. Now!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Why is it looking at me like that!?</p><hr><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Master, whatever you do, do not leave our side! You are its only target.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> It isn&#39;t even paying attention to us while we fight it. You are the only one it wants!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Now I see. Since they loathe humans, they see Heroic Spirits like us as no more than obstacles.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Here it comes! Please keep your defenses as tight as possible!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...Get back!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...!</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Th-that was cutting it awfully close, don&#39;t you think!?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Indeed. Had Moriarty not called out, you would have perished.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Thanks!</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Hahaha, good show, James! But, never mind that for now...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> This is impossible!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> There&#39;s no way we can defeat it here and now! How about you, Holmes!?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> It&#39;s useless, isn&#39;t it!?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Indeed. You and I have both reached the same inevitable conclusion.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> In order to get through this dire situation, someone must sacrifice themselves.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...I suppose you&#39;re right.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You can&#39;t be serious!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I know it is not a course of action you will like,but I&#39;m afraid it is truly the only choice.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Believe me, I&#39;m not happy about it either! Dammit, if only it were still a Rider!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Isn&#39;t there another way!?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> No. You must not surrender to delusions on the battlefield, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Hmm...Perhaps we should decide this fair and square, through rock-paper-scissors.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I&#39;ll use paper, so make sure you all use rock.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Very well, you can stay. If it helps, I shall send you off with the light of my sacred sword.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Frankly, as far as Servants go, I&#39;m ranked down to a point where I&#39;m barely stronger than Master here.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> So please don&#39;t include me in your count.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Don&#39;t worry. Master has already told me how you can manage by disguising yourself as Edmond.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Damn!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Hey, dragon witch.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> We should decide who the sacrifice will be now, while the Avenger of Shinjuku is out of commission.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Hm? Oh, that? I&#39;ll handle it.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...What?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> You need someone to keep it here, right? I got this.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> You all hurry up and get lost. I can only buy you a little time.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Use it to come up with a plan or a trap or something and take it out for good.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Wait. Should we not decide this more fairly, through rock-paper-scissors?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Shut up, ice bitch queen. I said I got this. You&#39;re good with that, right Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> What, can&#39;t even sacrifice your own allies? What a pathetic excuse for a commander you are.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> No, I&#39;m not.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Yeah yeah, I get it, you don&#39;t wanna see me die. Too bad. It&#39;s not like I care what you want.</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I suppose this is motivated by some sympathy you feel for a fellow Avenger, Ms. Jeanne?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Hell no. It&#39;s nothing as wholesome as that.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> I just hate seeing it running around like some mindless damn monster.... It should at least have some kinda goal.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> So it&#39;s up to me to give it a goal. Nothing to do with sympathy. I just wanna give it a real end.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> But that doesn&#39;t mean you need to die.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Tch. Not like I&#39;m planning on dying. I&#39;m proud of all the shit I&#39;ve pulled off.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> This is true. If anyone can do this, it&#39;s someone as impudent and brazen as you.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Right?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Very well then, one word of warning, if I may: watch your feet.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> My feet? Uh, okay...</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Jeanne d&#39;Arc Alter.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> What?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> I&#39;m counting on you.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...I said get lost. I got this.</p><p><strong>Hessian Lobo:</strong></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/9QdxWyo.png" alt="3-light"></p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Oh no you don&#39;t!</p><p><strong>Hessian Lobo:</strong></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/cUedQZ5.png" alt="4-light"></p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Ahahahaha!

Because you&#39;re me!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> You hate everything with a passion! You spend every day with an unquenchable fire burning inside you!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> You keep killing, and killing, but it never goes away! Not even if you kill the ones behind it all!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> So you have no choice but to burn everything down! Cause that might just make this awful feeling go away!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> But, spoiler alert: it won&#39;t! Not for the rest of your goddamn life!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> You won&#39;t be rid of it till the day you die! You and I are both beings of pure hate.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> We&#39;re killing machines, forever moving faster and faster, taking life after life until we finally bite the dust ourselves.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> And you don&#39;t have any friends or allies here. Or your beloved wife.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> So I&#39;ll put you out of your misery, Wolf King.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Because those fleeting dreams we see right as we die are all we Avengers have to live for!</p><p><strong>Hessian Lobo:</strong></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/9QdxWyo.png" alt="3-light"></p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...Ow...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Shit...This...this wound&#39;s definitely fatal.

It&#39;s all just hate with you. At least learn to enjoy your revenge, you dumb mutt!</p><p><strong>Hessian Lobo:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...Oh, right. I guess you can&#39;t even enjoy that anymore, can you?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Ngh...!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Oh, and one more thing...I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m gonna make sure you stay here a little longer.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> La Grondement Du Haine!</p><p><strong>Hessian Lobo:</strong></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/cUedQZ5.png" alt="4-light"></p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Y&#39;know, here&#39;s a fun fact about this fire: it&#39;s coming straight outta my body. Straight from mine into yours.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...And I bet even a dumb brute like you won&#39;t be able to shrug it off!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Oh, I&#39;m sure it won&#39;t be enough to kill you...but it&#39;ll damn sure slow you down for a while!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Gaaah.</p><p><strong>Hessian Lobo:</strong></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/9QdxWyo.png" alt="3-light"></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> It&#39;s no good...I can&#39;t move a muscle.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> It&#39;s even hard to breathe. Must&#39;ve burned my lungs...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Well, it&#39;s not like being able to move would make much of a difference anyway.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Ugh, it hurts. I&#39;m so thirsty. I&#39;d kill for a drop of water.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I&#39;m just a fake...a counterfeit. All I really know is that painful memories are just thatpainful.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I don&#39;t think I really got just how much it would hurt to be burned alive.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> That stupid holy maiden...How could she hurt like this and never think to take revenge?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Compared to her, I may just be downright sane.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The world is irredeemably dark. Humans are as inconsequential as anything can possibly be.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The most any so-called good person can do is turn a blind eye.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I used to think I&#39;d never lift a finger to help creatures as lowly as that.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Creatures so credulous, nitwitted, pathetic, optimistic, good-natured, airheaded, and helpless.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> People like [\u2642 him /\u2640 her], a symbol of humanity, who never stop moving forward no matter how scared, or desperate, or downtrodden they become.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...Oh, I almost forgot to say something important.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...Geez, did it not even occur to you to ask me to dance? Stupid inconsiderate jerk.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...I try to remember what that irritating damn detective said...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> But by the time the memory takes form, I slip into unconsciousness...</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...So how do we beat him?</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I&#39;m told you fought against various monsters during the Seventh Singularity.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Y-yes, that&#39;s true.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> In Babylonia, Master and I fought against Tiamat&#39;s Demonic Beasts, and against Tiamat herself.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Of course, we only succeeded thanks to everyone else&#39;s help.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Compared to that, calling the Wolf King a Demonic Beast is a disservice.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> After all, he was originally nothing but an ordinary wolf.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> No matter what sort of wolf he may be, he&#39;s still a species that existed in 1999. Naturally, he would have had no association with anything related to magecraft.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> At that time, there were still some superstitions remaining in the Americas, and while there were no doubt some people who thought of Lobo as the devil, that doesn&#39;t make it so.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> He was nothing more than an ordinary wolf, a simple animal, a mere Phantom Spirit...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> And yet, even as decades\u2013even centuries\u2013passed, his anger never once subsided.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> He continued to despise humans, and eventually gained power intended solely to kill them.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Quite dreadful, isn&#39;t it, Master?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Now that things have come to this, we must deal with a mere wolf as though he were a true Demonic Beast.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...Indeed.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> There&#39;s no possible way anyone would confuse him with a \u201Cmere wolf. \u201D</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Lobo, the Wolf King.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> According to Dr. Seton&#39;s writings, they were never once able to catch him in a trap.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Quite right, Ms. Kyrielight.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Back then in America, wolves were a tremendous problem for those who kept livestock. Thus, they came to be hunted to the point of near-extinction.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> A fine story that is. First people come building their farms in the wolves&#39; territory, then they have the gall to go and nearly wipe them out in answer to a problem they created.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Yet the fact remains that people must keep livestock in order to ensure their own survival.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> In our time, the industrial revolution was already well underway. Trains rumbled across the land, and smoke covered the sky.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> At some point, our respect for nature turned into defiance.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Defiance?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Yes. A willful defiance, where our sole goal was to triumph over our \u201Copponent\u201D by any means necessary.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> For us, nature was something to be fought...But in time, our technology grew to surpass it.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> But by then, once-common animals had disappeared, and nature was on the brink of annihilation.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> At some point, we looked around and realized that we had long since left it in the dust.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Having finally come to our senses, we began going in the opposite direction, to try and preserve nature.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> In that sense, one could say that Wolf King Lobo was a casualty of that time.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Even so...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Even so, we still have to defeat him.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Quite right! My apologies for that somewhat tedious tangent.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> But that was the moment that Lobo became our enemy;a painful truth you will need to bear the weight of.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I thought it would be best to help you acclimate to its weight now, but I see there was no need.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> You know, Holmes, at times you strike me as a perfectly dastardly villain yourself.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I know, right?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Hahahaha. I believe you just might have a point,Ms. Altria.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> But, that doesn&#39;t matter now. We still need to figure out what to do about the Wolf King.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Not because he is our enemy. Nor even to repair the Singularity.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...May I ask what you mean by that?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...He must be in a lot of pain.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Pain? The Wolf King, you mean?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> I doubt you would understand, Moriarty.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> What would I not understand!?</p><hr><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> You are the head of a villainous organization.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> You know what you do is evil, yet something akin to instinct compels you to do it nonetheless.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Of course, I am no different. I do evil so that order may be preserved.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> That doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that I fully understand. But the Dragon Wi\u2013that woman mentioned something the other day...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Hatred and revenge are what keep me alive. Even so, my heart still groans from the strain at times.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Why?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> It&#39;s not the last gasps of a dying conscience or anything as trite or cheesy as that.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> It&#39;s a simple matter of the heart&#39;s acceleration. We run at full speed all the time in order to satiate our revenge.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> We keep going faster and faster. Half-assed hatred won&#39;t cut it. Half-assed revenge is a waste.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Now, when we take revenge on someone who REALLY deserves it...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> That&#39;s the point when we realize we can never stop. That our bloodthirsty heart will never be satiated, even though it should have been...The cracks start to show, and all we want is more.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Forever and ever...Into eternity...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Yeah, I know there aren&#39;t too many Servants in this class. But more of us have been popping up lately.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> So tell Master that if we ever happen to run into one, you kill them good and dead.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Don&#39;t just defeat them.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Killing them is like freeing a bird that&#39;s fallen to the ground, and will never fly again.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> So tell [\u2642 him /\u2640 her] to do whatever it takes to make sure they&#39;re dead. Tell [\u2642 him /\u2640 her] to show no mercy.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Jeanne...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I hope she&#39;s okay.</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...Now I see.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Of course, I understand hatred as a motive for crime. I thought I understood Avengers as well.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> But it seems my understanding was surface-level at best.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...All that said, the problem is the Wolf King.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Let us say that top Servants from all classes, including myself, were to challenge him together.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> What do you think he would do once our victory drew near?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Run away, most likely.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Fortunately for him, and unfortunately for us,he has nothing in the way of pride.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> If he senses he is at a disadvantage,he won&#39;t hesitate to run.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Living things are optimized to prioritize their survival. That&#39;s doubly true for beasts of instinct.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> No matter how driven by hatred he may be,he is still a wolf.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> So the first order of business is to ensure he cannot run away.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um, what about leading him somewhere indoors?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I measured his energy when he charged. Sadly, there aren&#39;t many walls strong enough to contain him.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You&#39;d need something like a fallout shelter, tens of meters underground. Anything else and you&#39;d have a hard time.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Master...In Seton&#39;s book, how did they eventually defeat the Wolf King?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I never finished it, so...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;ll send you a digital copy from the library immediately, Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s a very sad story, so please try to read it right away!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Something about Blanca...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Indeed. They used the body of Lobo&#39;s beloved wife, the white wolf Blanca, as bait in their trap.</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But now that he&#39;s an Avenger, I can&#39;t imagine he&#39;ll fall for the same sort of trap twice.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Ah, Da Vinci, you only say that because your knowledge of this Shinjuku is limited.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> ...Indeed. In this place, the power of stories is far greater than you might think.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Here, tales of Heroic Spirits can be as much of a weakness as Achilles&#39; heel or Siegfried&#39;s back.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Their manner of death as depicted in their stories is of utmost importance. That knowledge can be as powerful as a Conceptual Weapon.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I see. In that case...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That would mean the Wolf King&#39;s weaknesses are animal traps, and his wife, Blanca.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I imagine you could find what you needed in Shinjuku to make the right sort of trap, but...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...Indeed. There is no Blanca here. No white wolf to be found.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Without her, Lobo would never fall for any trap in the first place.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> After all, Seton only resorted to her because poison, camouflage, and everything else failed.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Hm?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Why, Cavall II, didn&#39;t you eat just a moment ago?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> We&#39;re having an important discussion now. Go wait in the corner like a good boy.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um...</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> What is it? Why are you all staring at Cavall II?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> He&#39;s white.</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Very white.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> White indeed.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Totally white.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> W-wait, hang on. Please tell me you&#39;re not all thinking what I think you&#39;re thinking...</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> N-no. You wouldn&#39;t!</p><h2 id="section-14-homesick" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-14-homesick" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 14: Homesick</h2><p><strong>Ruffian:</strong> Aaaaaah!

Aaaaaah!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The first time I ate a human felt absurdly good.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> My pack is dead. All of them, dead.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> They were poisoned, and died painfully. Their heads were blown off by those long sticks.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> They were choked to death with rope. Dead, dead, dead. Each and every one of them, dead.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Blanca is dead too. So are my pups, no doubt.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...How methodical. Instead of instinct, they use their intelligence to kill efficiently.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> A beast like me could never understand. Even if I were to be reborn, all I could do is use my jaws.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I didn&#39;t like the idea of someone riding me at first, but he doesn&#39;t say anything or get in my way.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> All he does is kill people automatically as I run. I can live with that.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I&#39;ve killed so many people. I thought I would kill as many of them as they did of us.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Males, females, small ones, big ones, fat ones, thin ones...It&#39;s okay to kill all of them!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Nobody can stop me. I won&#39;t let them stop me!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Every time I took revenge, I was sure that things would go back to the way they were. That someday, I would once again return to the land where my pack and I roamed.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I was so sure of it. And yet...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Ahh, more humans. I have to kill them. Once I do that, then...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Then...Huh? What was it I wanted again?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Here he comes, Master. Remember, hold on tight to me, and don&#39;t let go no matter what.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I know.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Good. Don&#39;t worry about getting too close. Just keep your arms around me.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> No one could survive without injury after hitting asphalt at two hundred kilometers per hour.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Don&#39;t worry. I don&#39;t want to die.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> A wise decision. Now wrap your arms around me and hold on tight.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Don&#39;t worry about how it may look. The important thing is to remain alive.</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Moriarty here. Everything&#39;s set on this end. How&#39;s the monitor situation shaping up, Da Vinci?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> We&#39;re good to track any time. How about you, Holmes?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> All set here. Good boy.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> This had better work! ...Oh, and Mash?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> You&#39;re absolutely certain that Cavall II agreed to this, right!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Y-yes, ma&#39;am! Um...at least, according to Fou!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> You wish to use Cavall II as bait!? Are you out of your minds!?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...Hmm. I do feel like it would give us a very decent chance of winning.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Agreed. In my estimation...that Avenger can no longer properly remember who Blanca was.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Any white, wolflike creature would surely stop him in his tracks, if for only a moment.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Hold it. Dogs have some of the sharpest senses in the world. How do you plan on fooling his nose?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Simple, Ms. Altria. There&#39;s no need to.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> No need to...?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Allow me to explain.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...Now I understand. But I still don&#39;t like it. I cannot put Cavall II in danger.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Just look at his floppy little body. How could you even think of putting a precious creature like this in front of that vicious wolf?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> (Cavall was the name of King Arthur&#39;s favorite dog. There&#39;s a reason why she named this one \u201CII. \u201D)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s true.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Cavall II could even be run over before he knew what happened.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> However, we still have yet to hear from Cavall II himself.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Aah!

This is wonderful, Master!</p><p><strong>All:</strong> Huh?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Are you certain he agreed? Really, truly, absolutely certain?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Haha, I&#39;m surprised to see you&#39;ve also mastered Animal Whispering.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Haha, I had to after I heard that you had.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...I&#39;m just gonna go with it.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I can see you wish to know more, Master. Very well, let me tell you!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Huh? No need for that, you say? Well, all right.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What the heck is Animal Whispering?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Essentially, it&#39;s an application of Animal Communication.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> For those of us who live in modern times, communicating with animals can be extremely difficult. Still, while we may not be able to communicate with them, we CAN read their own thoughts.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Though of course, it requires some training.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Training...So then, if I train, I can understand what Fou is saying.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um, Mr. Holmes, could I ask you to teach me how to communicate with animals sometime?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Hey, why not ask me? I am a professor, after all.</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...All right, Fou, I&#39;ll trust you! Timing will be everything, Master. Be ready for it.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...! Spirit Origin pattern confirmed!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It&#39;s definitely the Avenger of Shinjuku...Wolf King Lobo and the Hessian!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Here he comes, Master.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...Cavall II may be in danger, but I hope you are aware that your situation is even more precarious.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Of course, I will be certain to protect you, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s why I&#39;m not worried.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> So I see. Very well, I suppose I had better make absolutely sure that your confidence is not misplaced, then.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Not that there was ever any doubt!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I trust you.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...Trust, huh?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> That word never meant much to me as I am now, but...coming from you...</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Very well then, I promise I shall do everything in my power to keep you safe!</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Here he comes! He&#39;s definitely following Fujimaru&#39;s scent!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> He may be invisible, but now we can at least narrow down his coordinates!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Be careful, he&#39;s still as fast as before! Get ready! Three...two...one...go!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> We&#39;re off!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> There he is!</p><hr><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Don&#39;t say a word, unless you want to see what wind pressure like this does to a person&#39;s head!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...!</p><hr><p><strong>Staff:</strong> Hessian Lobo has passed the checkpoint! His speed remains the same!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Prepare the Point One trap!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> All right, time to see how well Kaburagi&#39;s extra-large Demonic Beast trap works!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Now!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Did it work!?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Damn, he jumped right over it!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Ugh. I know we expected as much,but I still can&#39;t believe it!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> He&#39;s so huge, and he couldn&#39;t even have noticed it right up until the last moment! Even our camouflage spell was perfect!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It couldn&#39;t have taken more than a few microseconds to react. And he didn&#39;t even break his stride!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Stop praising him and focus on the task at hand!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Oh, right! Activating next trap in three, two, one...!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Second trap, activated! Not that I expect it will work any better!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> He&#39;s evaded this one as well. He reacted even faster than the first time!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> He&#39;s got us completely figured out! Is this plan really going to work!?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Why would you even ask that now, you fool!? ...Master, are you still all right!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (Cling harder without saying a word)</p><hr><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Good! All right, last one!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Holmes! It&#39;s all up to you now!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I am well aware of that.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Now listen up. No matter what happens, do not move. Doing so will only put you in danger.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Five seconds until he reaches the third trap! ...Four!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Three!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Two!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> One...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Zero!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Zero!</p><p><strong>Hessian Lobo:</strong> !!!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> How&#39;s that!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> He&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Stopped!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...My apologies, Lobo. I&#39;m afraid we must use your love to engineer your doom once more.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...We&#39;ve got him!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Hessian Lobo has come to a stop! We also have visual confirmation!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...Here we go, Master. There&#39;s no telling how long that trap will be able to hold him here.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> If he has to, I have no doubt he&#39;ll gnaw off his leg in order to escape. We cannot wait for backup.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> We have to take him down, here and now. Any objections!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Let&#39;s finish this.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...Indeed.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Now is the time to stop running, Wolf King.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Let&#39;s help him rest.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Agreed.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Jeanne was right.

You did, didn&#39;t you!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You sound like an NPC in a video game.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I know, but trust me, it&#39;s really clear when you&#39;re monitoring the situation!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Not just yet!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Oh yes you did!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I can already see the Avenger retreating into the vanishing zone.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It won&#39;t be long before they disappear.</p><hr><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Indeed. They have surely lost too much magical energy to be able to retreat effectively.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> However...</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> It is either hatred or revenge that drives you.... No one else can suffer in your place.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> That suffering is your punishment, but it is also nothing less than your greatest joy.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> But, it has gone on long enough.... Farewell, Wolf King.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Huh!?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Stay out of this, Dullahan!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Did he just...throw his weapon away?</p><hr><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> What are you playing at?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> He&#39;s spreading his hands, and...No, it can&#39;t be.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> He&#39;s protecting him?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Either move aside or take up your weapon. I will not hesitate to cut you down whether you resist or not.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Is he trying to protect Lobo?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Y-yes, I believe he is...</p><hr><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> What kind of Servant are you!? Move aside!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What was that sound...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Uh oh!

He&#39;s moving much slower now, so you can still catch up to him on foot!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Wait right\u2013</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> That&#39;s enough, Ms. Altria. It&#39;s over now.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Holmes? What is the meaning of this?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Let him go. We have our victory.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Both the Hessian and Lobo are as good as dead now. Let them spend their last moments as they see fit.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I understand your wish to see the deed through to the end, but it&#39;s all right.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> He has finally regained his freedom. Your role is complete.</p><p><strong>Hessian:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I see...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Exactly so, [\u2642 Mr. /\u2640 Ms. ] Fujimaru. The Wolf King is at long last nothing more than a mere beast again.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> But...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> ...Your fears are correct, [\u2642 Mr. /\u2640 Ms. ] Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> The Wolf King no longer has a home to return to.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So...Lobo wants to go back home to the plains of Currumpaw, in America.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> I see...It is a shame that he cannot do that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> The problem is not that he is too far from home. It&#39;s that he has been hell-bent on revenge.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> He has forgotten his home, and the faces of his pack.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Even their scents have been blotted out by the stench of Shinjuku.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> All he remembers now is that he once had a home to return to. Not how to get there.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> There is nothing more we can do for him,[\u2642 Mr. /\u2640 Ms. ] Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I&#39;m afraid his story has already come to an end.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...? What is it, Cavall II?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Something precious is leaving me. The sense of loss is greater than the simple pain.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I guess I must have lost again. It must have been that white dog.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Why did I stop when I saw it? It was only a stray dog, nothing more.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...And yet, when I think about it, it makes me strangely heartsick. I&#39;d better stop thinking about it.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I can&#39;t even run now that I&#39;ve chewed my leg off. That steel horse could catch up to me in no time.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> And yet, it hasn&#39;t. Which must mean...Could that man who was riding on me be holding them back?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> What am I saying? That&#39;s ridiculous. I never opened up to him even once.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I never treated him as anything more than a tool. There&#39;s no reason he would do something like that for me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Anyway...Where should I go now?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I wanted to go home. I wanted to go back to my homeland.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> But I can&#39;t see it anywhere. I can&#39;t remember it. I don&#39;t even know its scent now.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Where in the world was it that I lived?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The ground was softer, I&#39;m sure. I know I could smell the grass there.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> There were countless glittering stars in the sky. The wind was gentle and refreshing.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> But all I have now are images in my head. I can&#39;t remember what any of those felt like.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The soft ground, the smell of the grass, the glittering stars, the refreshing wind...None of them.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I&#39;m sure I experienced them all. But I can&#39;t remember anything about them.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> But, I still want to go home more than anything. It&#39;s over now. I&#39;ve lost.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I want to go home. I want to go home! I want to go home...!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...Ahh.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> After taking a deep breath, and exhaling what remains of my life, I finally understand.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I no longer have a home to go back to. No, that&#39;s not right...This is now the only home I have.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I was summoned of my own will, and slaughtered people here by choice. I made this my territory, and my howls let all the people here know they had reason to be afraid.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> This filthy place where people live...is my true home now.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> So I can no longer go back there. I threw it away, and I&#39;ve been searching for it all this time.</p><h2 id="section-15-shinjuku-fly-high" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-15-shinjuku-fly-high" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 15: Shinjuku Fly High</h2><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...In short, no matter how you slice it, this is premeditated murder.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> There&#39;s no deep motive here. The only forces at work are grudges, money, and jealousy.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> There may be a few tricks, but they&#39;re trivial. Still, they&#39;re beyond any detective.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> But now, they&#39;re failing.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I&#39;ve given up on about half my calculations, leaving only a slapdash bet where the odds are against us.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I swore to myself that this plan I came up with would never let me do that.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> And yet, I did it. And all because...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I wanted to beat [\u2642 him /\u2640 her].</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> And down goes the Avenger.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> We may only have to wait for the magical bullet to get here now, but that doesn&#39;t mean we can just sit around.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> So why are you so relaxed? Is the bullet already on its way?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> It&#39;s not coming here. Not yet, anyway.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> So now that the Avenger has been defeated, you and I are the only ones who can protect the Barrel.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> I&#39;ll do my job, not to worry. Luckily this tower is easy to protect, and real tough to attack.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...I see.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> But that doesn&#39;t mean we can just stay holed up in here doing nothing. I&#39;ll go prepare an ambush outside.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> If it works out, we&#39;ll be able to lure them into a pincer attack at the base of the tower and catch them in the cross fire.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Sherlock Holmes would see through something like that in an instant.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> The battlefield&#39;s just the kind of place where detective and mastermind logic falls apart.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> There&#39;s no time for cold deduction there. Only chaos and fervor.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> The chaos of battle leaves no room for calculations, and that kind of fervor rips theory to shreds.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> The battlefield&#39;s where the lowest of life forms can easily destroy the highest form of art.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...I see. Well, do as you see fit.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I won&#39;t be of much use when it comes to practical tactics anyway.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> A seasoned mercenary like you would be far better suited to come up with ideas.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll make sure they suffer.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Get to your positions. Suit up for heavy combat. Use anti-Demonic Beast gear if you have to.</p><p><strong>Hornet:</strong> But aren&#39;t we only going up against Servants?</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Believe me, I know what we&#39;re going up against better than most.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Anti-Servant gear&#39;s not gonna cut it.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> We&#39;ll be much better off with the anti-Demonic Beast gear&#39;s sheer explosive power.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Use the tungsten alloy armor-piercing ammo. It&#39;s cursed so it should be pretty effective against them. Keep up a steady stream of gunfire and pin &#39;em down.</p><p><strong>Hornet:</strong> Yes, sir.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> ...Even if you all make it this far, that Servant will utterly destroy you.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> If Jeanne Alter is like a human carpet bombing, the altered King of Knights is akin to an artillery cannon.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Although, given that she&#39;s using that toy to get around, perhaps I should call her a giant high-speed mobile artillery platform?</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Ugh, it&#39;s always something...Still, it&#39;s almost over now.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> It doesn&#39;t matter how bloody things get. As long as everything&#39;s consistent, that&#39;s what counts.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> What a fool the Master of Chaldea is to willingly meet [\u2642 his /\u2640 her] end here after saving the world.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> [\u2642 He /\u2640 She] may think [\u2642 he /\u2640 she] can save this place, but [\u2642 he&#39;s /\u2640 she&#39;s] wrong. All [\u2642 he /\u2640 she] can do now is die a miserable death.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Well done, Cavall II.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> It was all thanks to you that we were victorious. As a reward, you shall have better dog food than normal.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Feel free to return to your guard post at the stronghold. You&#39;ve earned it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It feels like Cavall II&#39;s more important than me.</p><hr><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> How astute of you, Master.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Indeed, I think of Cavall II as my personal hunting dog...or rather, as descended from one.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (So, she&#39;s got her own headcanon for him...)</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Essentially, I consider him one of my loyal knights, and am willing to dub him appropriately.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Which means that, in my court, he does indeed rank slightly above you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What kind of king are you!?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Benevolent as some kings may be,each is a tyrant in the end.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Pretend you never heard that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Allow me to rub your shoulders, Sir Cavall II.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> He says it is most agreeable. At least, I believe he does.</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> We&#39;re back, [\u2642 Mr. /\u2640 Ms. ] Fujimaru, Ms. Altria.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Hi.</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Papa&#39;s home! Come here and give me a big kiss on the cheek!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Die.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> How could you say that? Fine then, I&#39;ll just be over here quietly scrying to myself.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Wait, did I say scrying? I meant crying.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (Mr. Moriarty, that sort of thing is exactly the problem...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> \u201CPapa,\u201D you stink.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Bwuh!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That hit way harder than I thought!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Are you all right, Mr. Moriarty!?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Uh, yes. I&#39;m fine, thank you.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Ahh, curse this despicable old man smell of mine!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> But really Master, you could stand to mince your words a bit when it comes to people&#39;s feelings!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Oh, don&#39;t give me that look, young Sherlock. You&#39;re lucky your prime was in the peak of your youth!</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> ...Ahem. Getting back on track...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> We have now defeated the Berserker, the Assassin, and the Avenger.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> That leaves the Archer of Shinjuku\u2013evil Moriarty\u2013and the altered version of Emiya, the nameless Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I have also learned that the latter is standing guard in front of the Barrel.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Along with about two hundred or so Hornets.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Two hundred...!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> However, I can assure you that time is most definitely not on our side.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> With the Phantom Spirit Der Freisch\xFCtz at his disposal, Moriarty can even control meteors.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> We don&#39;t know when a meteor will be loaded and fired, but we do know we can&#39;t afford to wait until that happens.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Well, hang on. Meteors almost never enter Earth&#39;s atmosphere to begin with.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I looked it up, and the only meteor that fell to Japan in 1999 was in Kobe.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> And it was tiny, barely weighing 136 grams in total. Hardly anything approaching an apocalyptic scale.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> You are quite right, Mr...Er, Ms. Da Vinci.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (He stumbled! )</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Don&#39;t worry about it, Holmes. Call me whatever you like.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> However, there is one thing I&#39;ve come to understand after seeing our Moriarty in action.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> You mean me?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I do.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> When you use that coffin of yours, you don&#39;t actually do much in the way of aiming, do you?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I sure don&#39;t. I fire, and it hits.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I&#39;m confident it would work even if I were facing away from my target entirely.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I don&#39;t have many memories of firing a gun when I was alive, so...I&#39;m surprised it works so well.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I imagine it would be much the same whether you were using bullets or missiles. Furthermore...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Evil Moriarty likely possesses the same power, only with greater potency. A truly frightening prospect.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> With such power, he could likely use any meteor visible from Earth in 1999 for his magical bullet.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Wha\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Seriously!?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Even Master is dumbfounded\u2013enough to react like a certain idol!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Are you lying!?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Is it just me, or did you all hear that sound like a great serpent creeping closer, too?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> What&#39;s more, there was indeed an asteroid observed in 1999.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> The one called Bennu. A B-type asteroid measuring an average of five hundred meters in diameter.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Analysis shows that it will approach Earth a number of times over the next two hundred years.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I believe this is the asteroid that evil Moriarty has designated to be his bullet.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Is that even possible?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I mean, the whole reason Phantom Spirits can never be Servants is because they lack the Spirit Origin values to ascend to being a Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Yes, if one were to evaluate Phantom Spirits by strength alone, they would be quite unimpressive.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> In terms of potency, they would even underperform a literary Caster who did nothing but pen stories.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Seriously!?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I can almost hear a voice saying \u201CDon&#39;t steal my gimmick! \u201D</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Are you lying!?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> There&#39;s that serpent again! And it&#39;s even closer this time.</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I am quite serious. After all, even if they were to be summoned, they wouldn&#39;t possess a body.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> And because they lack a body, they are unable to do anything.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Regardless of how much magical energy you provide them, they have no means of storing it. You could think of each of them as a vase with a hole.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> However, this hole is on the side of the vase, not the bottom, so it IS able to hold SOME energy.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> For an experienced mage, I imagine this would pose no issue at all.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> All that said...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Even having said all of that, we Servants still have quite the trump card to play, no matter how weak we might be, and that still holds true for Phantom Spirits.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Noble Phantasms!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Exactly. Where such things are concerned, there is little difference between a Phantom Spirit and a Heroic one.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> The reason is simple: Noble Phantasms are based off of stories, legends, and objects that truly existed.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> When such things become a Noble Phantasm, their power might be reduced, or, in rare cases, even enhanced.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Of course, when a Phantom Spirit is summoned, the power of their Noble Phantasm likely decays considerably. Not that a Phantom could use one anyway.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> However, the concept of a Noble Phantasm remains the same.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> In short, with enough magical energy, a Noble Phantasm can form. So by fusing a Heroic Spirit and Phantom Spirit to raise the value of the Spirit Origin...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Even an object in space can be made into a bullet!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Not to worry, my dear Da Vinci. This Shinjuku is the only place where such a thing is possible.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Ordinarily, fusing Phantom and Heroic Spirits together, or even two Phantoms, is nigh impossible.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hey, that&#39;s it! That&#39;s the key.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I remember we combed through Chaldea&#39;s servers to pull up all the details on Phantom Spirits.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But just like how Heroic Spirits can&#39;t fuse, neither can Phantom Spirits. It should be impossible.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Or rather, no one would ever think to do so. Who actually went and did such a thing!?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I&#39;m afraid the time is not yet right to tell you that. We should avoid speculation.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Or rather, to be precise, we should focus on the more immediate problem at hand!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> As I was just saying, Emiya Alter and two hundred Hornets are standing guard outside the Barrel.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Here&#39;s a digital snapshot I took. I&#39;ll send it to Chaldea so you can fix it up.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> How&#39;s this? I laid it out in a table view to make it easier.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I took my best guess at marking off how many enemies are there and what weapons they&#39;re carrying.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> They&#39;re using mass-produced firearms, so as long as we can partially see them, we can manage.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Hmm. It appears to be a bog-standard formation, but an effective one.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Looks like they&#39;re armed with weapons typically used for taking down large Demonic Beasts.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> They&#39;re clearly aiming for me.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Which means that I will be unable to use Cuirassier Alter to charge in and cause a disturbance.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> While attacking them straight on may be a safe option, it would also take a lot of time.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> All we have in the way of fighters are myself and Moriarty. Holmes will be of no help here.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> My apologies. I am but a humble detective, after all.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> That doesn&#39;t seem to be slowing down your rival-slash-mathematician-slash-hunter!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> And there&#39;s another problem.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> A royal guard should keep their defenses as tight as possible, and be prepared to move quickly to cover any gaps that may appear in them.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Given who we are up against, it would be all but impossible to sow chaos among their ranks with our numbers.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Besides, he expects us to charge in. If only there was something we could do that no one could see coming...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Mash?</p><hr><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> What is it, Mash Kyrielight? That \u201Coh\u201D certainly sounds as though you have an idea.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> N-not at all! N-no ideas here, n-no sirree!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Come on, spill it!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s nothing! Really! Please don&#39;t give it another thought, Senpai!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Answer the question, Mash. If you don&#39;t, I&#39;ll turn you into Mashed Kyrielight.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Uh...Er...Well...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I just...happened to remember...Arash...</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Arash...Do you mean Arash Kamangir, the Hero of the East?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What about him...?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m sorry, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> When Altria mentioned breaking through the formation in a unique way, I couldn&#39;t help but remember.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Hm?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I don&#39;t believe we know that one. What in the world happened?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Aaah!</p><hr><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> My my, it must be quite a good plan if it can make Master blanch. Tell us more about it, Mash.</p><p><strong>Hornet:</strong> Spade 1, all clear. I&#39;ve completed patrol of Point Alpha, and am returning to base.</p><p><strong>Hornet:</strong> Club 2, all clear. Nothing up here on the roof.</p><p><strong>Hornet:</strong> Diamond 4 here. I can just make out the sound of a motorcycle engine.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> ...Let me hear it.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> They&#39;re here. Keep your ears open for any other motorcycle sounds.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Hmph, for a legendary king, I&#39;m disappointed this is the best strategy she could come up with. One-way ticket to hell.</p><p><strong>Hornet:</strong> ...Fire!</p><p><strong>Hornet:</strong> Release the net!</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Hmph, so they&#39;ve resorted to an all-or-nothing gamble. How boring!</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> All hands, keep watching the perimeter! I&#39;ll confirm their disappearance myself! Guards, come with me!</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> I knew it. That&#39;s the king&#39;s motorcycle.... Let&#39;s see how her Spirit Origin is doing.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> She&#39;s still here! It&#39;s a decoy! Remain on the aler\u2013Huh!?</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> I&#39;m detecting a Servant close by! Is it Saber!?</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> ...Above!?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Too slow, Archer!</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Tch!</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> I&#39;m surprised to see you and your Master drop in like this.... How did you do it?</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> If any Command Spell backup had flown in here, we would have noticed its energy and wiped it out.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Indeed. Which is why we didn&#39;t come here via Mana Burst or Command Spell.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> We flew here. Literally. I like this!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Please...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Spare me...</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> All right, that should do it! What do you think, Da Vinci?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Looking good!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I created the plans according to Mash&#39;s specifications, and modified them to fire without Arash&#39;s bow and arrow.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It was a little tricky constructing it entirely out of materials found in Shinjuku on short notice.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But genius that I am, I knew I could do it!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Of course, we were the ones who did all the work!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You&#39;re a math professor, right? How can you have so much trouble cutting a straight piece of iron?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Maybe it&#39;s BECAUSE I&#39;m a math professor!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> At any rate, the Da Vinci-modified Moriarty flyer was a complete success!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I believe you mean \u201CDa Vinci flyer\u201D!? I have a patent on it, you know! A patent!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Tch. So this is why the rich get richer!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (What in the world are they arguing about...? )</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Well, no matter. As I explained earlier, Master and Altria will take this over to...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m outta here!</p><hr><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Forget it. You cannot escape me.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> We&#39;re doing this no matter what, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Don&#39;t worry. I personally guarantee the flyer&#39;s safety.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Read: I&#39;m pretty sure you&#39;ll be okay with Altria protecting you. Probably.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Worry not, Master. I am your sword, and your shield. I shall remove any and all threats in our path.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Now get on. We&#39;re going to fly this thing to the moon.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Nooo!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Heeelp!</p><hr><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> You whine like a cat forced to take a bath. Go on, get closer.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Okay, once I pull this lever, whoosh! You&#39;ll be off!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Got it. Now hurry up and get ready, Master.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Okay, you&#39;re all good to go!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Are you all set, Mr. Holmes!?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Not really, if I&#39;m being honest, but I&#39;ll make do! Hahaha! It&#39;s a bit hard being a noncombatant!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> But not to worry, I promise I&#39;ll be there at the appointed time!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Good. Now let us head to the final battlefield!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Isn&#39;t there any other way!?</p><hr><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> However, that doesn&#39;t change the fact that you&#39;ve dived straight into your enemy&#39;s camp.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> That&#39;s true. But once I cut you down, my role will be complete.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> What...!?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Ready your weapons, Archer. I won&#39;t even ask you for a fair fight. Feel free to use as many as you like.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Why you little...!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> ...! Was that...!?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Oh, I should have known you would notice, Archer. I see your eyes are as sharp as ever.</p><p><strong>Hornet:</strong> Captain!

That was cutting it far too close, but it appears it was well worth it. Take that!</p><p><strong>Hornet:</strong> Uh oh...The Coloraturas have started targeting us!</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Dammit...Without Berserker around, there&#39;s no one left to control them!</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> What are you waiting for!? Take them out!</p><p><strong>Hornet:</strong> Yes sir!</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> That sound...!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Well done, Moriarty!</p><p><strong>Hornet:</strong> Captain, there&#39;s too many for us! What do we do!?</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Get a hold of yourself! Take care of the smoke cloud and take each one out!

I was mistaken.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> ...Is that so.</p><p><strong>Hornet:</strong> Whoa, easy there, Emiya! Not so rough!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I may not be as good as some, but every evil mastermind needs at least some facility with disguises!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Of course, in my case, I had to resort to help from Holmes, but never mind that!</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> The good Moriarty, eh? ...You should have stayed put like the trash you are.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Or is it actually you?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Hm? I beg your pardon?</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Well, never mind that. You want to see the Archer of Shinjuku, huh? Go on then.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> He already knew this was coming no matter what I did.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Have fun running around the Barrel.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...Very well then, I&#39;ll go do just that. Nothing like crushing one&#39;s own dreams oneself, after all!</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Shut up.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> You handle this area. I&#39;ll go after them.</p><p><strong>Hornet:</strong> Yes sir.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> We can&#39;t have any of them escaping. Once I go in, blow up the entryway to seal it.</p><p><strong>Hornet:</strong> Yes sir! ...But, what about the tower&#39;s internal defenses?</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> No one else is going to do us any good in there. Or are you volunteering to be a meat shield?</p><p><strong>Hornet:</strong> U-understood, sir!</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> (There&#39;s no telling what might happen if you small-timers interfere. )</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> (You can all die here along with the puppets. )</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> All right, the end of the world is almost here.

Instead, he uses his work to express how he wishes the world was.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You can see that in the affection he shows toward Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Shakespeare may think highly of you, but only because he thinks you&#39;ll inspire great new stories.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> He dearly loves anything out of the ordinary, be it tragedy or comedy.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Whereas Andersen helps you, even reluctantly, because you remind him of the ideals he held while writing his stories back when he was alive.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> He may hate the world, its people, and even himself, but he can&#39;t completely give up what love he still has.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Even though they may both be looking at Fujimaru, they see very different things.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I see....

The foreign entity at the edge of the Incineration of Humanity!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Foreign entity!?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Lord Babbage was summoned as a Heroic Spirit to serve a Demon God Pillar, which is how he was able to obtain all the relevant numbers.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> The next step, naturally, is to use those numbers in a calculation. Any mathematician would do the same.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Specifically, he calculated a future that assumed the Incineration of Humanity took place, rather than calculating a way to try and prevent the incineration.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> That&#39;s when he made his discovery.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> He learned that the Mage King would destroy the post-2018 future, even without the incineration!</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A???:</strong> Right you are, detective of Baker Street.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A???:</strong> Over the course of 3,000 years, I have gained the ability to fuse Phantom Spirits and Heroic Spirits!</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A???:</strong> Innumerable cast-offs, forgotten by history, devoid of faith...</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A???:</strong> And yet, they possessed untold value! Urban legends! Fairy tales! Extinct beasts!</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A???:</strong> It was exactly what I couldn&#39;t understand before...and what I need now!</p><p><strong>Demon God Bael:</strong> A passion for punishment. A vow for revenge. They are what fuel my existence! I am Demon God Bael!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Then let me ask you, Bael. How deeply was Moriarty involved in this!?</p><p><strong>Demon God Bael:</strong> There is no need for me to answer that. You already have your answer.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...I was involved in every part, Holmes.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I...Huh...?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Wha...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Wh-what the...?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Moriarty...You&#39;re...Now I see!

It was all backwards!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I can&#39;t believe you would go that far...That you would risk everything in this way!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> So you even threw away certainty in your pursuit of victory!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...I reached you, Holmes. It was almost too easy for me...But this time I win.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> This time, there can be no doubt.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> So this is what it is to lose...Loath as I am to admit it, Moriarty, victory is indeed yours.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I am so sorry, [\u2642 Mr. /\u2640 Ms. ] Fujimaru. I made a grave mistake in my deductions.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> !?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No way!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Altria! Kill me at once! There may still be hope for\u2013</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Nice try, my sworn enemy. But your companions are ill-equipped to follow your line of reasoning!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Farewell, Holmes!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> The greatest detective of all time! One who shared my perspective, but never my position!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> With your power, I will achieve true victory!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...! Mr. Holmes&#39;s Spirit Origin is...not disappearing!?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Indeed it isn&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> I can still sense his Servant aura...but from Moriarty!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Of course. I didn&#39;t kill him, I absorbed him. That was how it needed to be done.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Moriarty...</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...How good to meet you, everyone. My name is James Moriarty.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I am the one who shall destroy this planet.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> When was it...When did you first betray us!?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> When? Why, just a moment ago. It feels as though my long, long calculation has finally come to an end.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Wait. Just a moment ago? You only decided to betray us then!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I-I don&#39;t get it! You&#39;re not making any sense at all!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I mean, if we were losing, I can see the logic in betraying us as a way to escape.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But we were winning! We were even strong enough to defeat Bael! I&#39;m sure of it!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> There was no reason for you to betray us!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...Would you mind, Bael?</p><p><strong>Demon God Bael:</strong> You&#39;re wasting your time. But, we League of Phantom Fiends members are nothing if not equal.</p><p><strong>Demon God Bael:</strong> If you wish to do so, I will wait.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Very well. I suppose you do at least have a right to know what is happening.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> And I have an obligation to answer. So I will answer all your questions, starting at the very beginning.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> After all, with Holmes gone, I&#39;m now the only one who can.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...Have you noticed it, Fujimaru? There&#39;s something fundamentally off about this Shinjuku, isn&#39;t there?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...It&#39;s like something out of fiction.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It&#39;s like we&#39;re inside a story.</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Exactly.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> This Shinjuku has been cut off from the outside world,and has no connection to humanity.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> As a result...it has become a fictional city.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> It&#39;s all but impossible to fuse a Phantom Spirit and a Heroic Spirit, or even two Phantom Spirits, anywhere but here.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> And it is here that Bael and I formed an alliance,in order to pursue our separate goals.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Bael&#39;s goal was to kill you, Fujimaru...And mine was to surpass Holmes.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> We banded together despite our differences in order to accomplish our otherwise impossible goals.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> That is the League of Phantom Fiends: one formed between Demon God and human.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You...wanted to surpass Holmes? Not kill him?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...Fujimaru, have you ever played 21? Where you count up in ones, and whoever says \u201Ctwenty-one\u201D first loses?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Each player can only say a maximum of three numbers in their turn: \u201Ctwo, three, four,\u201D or \u201Cten, eleven, twelve,\u201D for example. If you had your choice, would you want to go first or second?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> First.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> And with that, you just sealed your loss.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Second.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Congratulations, you just sealed your victory.</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> To get your opponent to say \u201Ctwenty-one,\u201D you need to end your turn on a multiple of four. You can&#39;t end on a multiple of four if you go first.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> And in our games...I always went first, while Holmes always went second.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> It&#39;s how our world was designed. Good would always triumph over evil.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> As long as I was Moriarty, I would never be able to win against Holmes.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Even summoned into these forms,these laws still restrain us.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> If I might employ a metaphor you may find helpful...It is like the Counter Force that appears when the world is in danger.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Killing him failed to help me win, nor could I outsmart him. So I thought as hard as I could.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> It&#39;s not as though Holmes never makes any mistakes. One need only consider Irene Adler, the woman who once outfoxed him, for that.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> But whenever he faces me, he always gives it his all. It&#39;s quite vexing. Thus, there was only one way to beat him.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I would have to join his side.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Is that so. Then you HAD betrayed us from the beginning.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> It is infuriating to think that we were so foolish as to not see it sooner.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Not at all. There was no way you could have seen it. After all...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You had erased your memory?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You reset yourself?</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...Snrk.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Hahahaha! Well done, Master! You really are a sharp one!</p><p><strong>Demon God Bael:</strong> Moriarty.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Right, right, sorry. Yes, you&#39;re exactly correct.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I reset myself to zero. I removed my memories and evil nature, created a good side, and was reborn.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> And not only me. I also removed Bael&#39;s memories.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> He believed himself to be \u201Cevil Moriarty\u201D and acted accordingly, and I did the same as \u201Cgood Moriarty. \u201D</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Right up to the moment \u201Cevil Moriarty\u201D disappeared just now.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> He only thought he was Moriarty, and behaved as such.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> If he hadn&#39;t, we would never have been able to defeat Holmes. Or you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No way...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Am I wrong? It would have been impossible to evade Holmes&#39;s observant eye.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> So I joined your group, and fought with all my strength and conviction at your side.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> That is the indisputable truth. Worry not, Master. You need not feel bad for failing to see through me!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Aww, thanks! (Jerk. )</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Hahahaha! I&#39;m glad to see you haven&#39;t lost your spirit!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That&#39;s no comfort now.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...Right, sorry about that. I forgot how good you really are.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> You&#39;re not sad that I betrayed you. You&#39;re sad that I turned to evil in the first place.</p><hr><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong> So, you&#39;ve finally shown yourself, Bael!</p><p><strong>Demon God Bael:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...You. Is this what you were after all along?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Emiya...!</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> It&#39;s not easy being a mercenary. Altered or not, distasteful or not, a job&#39;s still a job.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Once I was summoned, my only true ally was myself. The only others around me were the Wolf King, Yan Qing, and the Phantom and Christine.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> I was hired to defeat the Demon God Pillar. Nothing else matters.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Besides, this world had already been cut off. People dying here wouldn&#39;t get in the way of my job.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> I didn&#39;t care if I fought for evil or good. My only goal was to ensure that balance was maintained.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> In which case, it made more sense to side with the winning team. Sensible, don&#39;t you think?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...I can&#39;t say I agree with that way of thinking. But, it does seem you&#39;re not our enemy.</p><p><strong>Demon God Bael:</strong> I see. I knew the answer was simple.</p><p><strong>Demon God Bael:</strong> I wasn&#39;t sure why you joined us, but I did know you meant to kill me.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Same here. I could tell you planned to use me and dispose of me.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> But I guessed that you wouldn&#39;t make your move until things had reached this point. Seems I was right.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Now then, Master of Chaldea. Those guys are my enemy, and I think they&#39;re yours too.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> In short, this may be the best chance we ever get.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> I have no way to help you all escape, and you don&#39;t have any reason to fight me.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Want to team up?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Okay.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Don&#39;t look at me like that. Some altered Servants are just like this.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> If you want to save the world, you better get used to it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You handle Bael.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> ...Will do. That was the plan all along, after all.</p><hr><p><strong>Demon God Bael:</strong> ...Are you going to fight, Moriarty?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I&#39;m tempted to say it&#39;s pointless to ask...but I suppose it isn&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Your revenge is now complete. This is as far as my obligation goes.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Let&#39;s begin, Bael.</p><p><strong>Demon God Bael:</strong> Indeed.</p><p><strong>Demon God Bael:</strong> I am Bael, the Demon God Pillar. My whole life has led to this moment. Soon, I shall have my revenge for the humiliation I&#39;ve suffered.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The Demon God Pillar is preparing to attack! Your orders, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> We&#39;re going to win, no matter what!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Well said. Try not to fall behind, Archer!</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Took the words right out of my mouth!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Let&#39;s do this, Moriarty!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...Indeed. Come at me then!</p><hr><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Demon God Bael:</strong></p><p>Hahahaha! I knew it! I knew I would be destroyed! But I still have my revenge!</p><p><strong>Demon God Bael:</strong> Thanks for sticking with me all this way, Moriarty! Our long alliance is now dissolved!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Agreed. Goodbye, Bael, my comrade in arms who willingly gave all he had to what we both knew was a foolish pursuit!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> You agreed to have your memories removed, and bore the humiliation of becoming human, all for revenge.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Farewell, demon god!</p><p><strong>Demon God Bael:</strong> Then we are birds of a feather, Moriarty! ...Fujimaru, sadly, I was unable to kill you.</p><p><strong>Demon God Bael:</strong> You were stronger than we were. I am humiliated, disgraced, shamed...Furious, in fact.</p><p><strong>Demon God Bael:</strong> Nevertheless, your fate is sealed.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What...?</p><hr><p><strong>Demon God Bael:</strong></p><p>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...So, it&#39;s over.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> As it is for you, Moriarty.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> That, my dear, is where you are mistaken. You, and this planet, are finished.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> What!? There&#39;s a meteor in the sky above Shinjuku!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> This composition...It&#39;s...Bennu!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But, Sheba has been constantly monitoring the sky there! It&#39;s like you&#39;ve moved to an entirely new area!</p><h2 id="section-18-great-detectives-great-deduction" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-18-great-detectives-great-deduction" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 18: Great Detectives&#39; Great Deduction</h2><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> This world is filled with stories, large and small. King Lear and Macbeth go without saying, of course.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> There&#39;s also the gangster from China,the Wolf King, the headless horseman...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Sherlock Holmes and I were part of one such story too. But none of them truly matter.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> What matters right now is another story.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Der Freisch\xFCtz, the marksman, could hit any target he wished with six out of seven bullets.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> But the seventh, controlled by the devil, shot someone precious to him, and he fell into despair.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Do you understand? In this story, the seventh bullet possesses powers on par with the Grim Reaper.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> At the same time, the devil MUST fire the seventh bullet. He has no choice in the matter.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...! Does that mean this meteor...is the seventh bullet!?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> And it activated the moment we tried to kill you! So that&#39;s why you moved it closer!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> So the moment Moriarty&#39;s death was confirmed,the meteor would prepare itself to be fired!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But if that were the case, the seventh bullet shouldn&#39;t go where Moriarty wants!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s controlled by the Devil, right? We have no way of knowing what it will hit...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Ah.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Mash?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No way. I can&#39;t believe it...That&#39;s why you did it, Professor?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No...How could you!?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I see you share Holmes&#39;s gift for deduction, Mash. Indeed, there is nothing and no one I hold precious.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> So I agonized over this. I had nothing I cared for enough to turn a meteor into one of the bullets.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Holmes deduced that I used the Holy Grail in order to strengthen the bullets.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...But, he was wrong.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> It was the first time that he had ever been wrong in his deductions about me.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> For my part, this was practically a gamble.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Furthermore, the odds were very much against me. As such, I had to tell Bael everything.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> On top of that, I also needed him to lose his memory.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> This is because he had to see me as \u201Cgood Moriarty,\u201D and genuinely try to dispose of me.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> He agreed to my plan, knowing that it had an extremely low chance of success.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> He said it was the only way we would be able to kill Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You don&#39;t mean...</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...I do.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> I don&#39;t understand. What is going on, Mash?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Moriarty...lost his memory, found a good side of himself, and fought alongside Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We know that much is true. But...if you look at it another way...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It also means that he now has someone he would risk his life to protect. Someone precious to him!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s why the bullet is headed towards you! Because that&#39;s where...the person he cares about is...</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Then...even bringing Master here was all part of your plan?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Exactly.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> The sheer humanity you have all shown me is remarkable. It reveals true goodness inside you.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> But while this makes you strong against evil,it also makes you weak against other good people.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Fight fire with fire, evil with evil...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> And good with good.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> In order to triumph against good,I became truly good myself!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Miscreant!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Indeed I am!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> A devil, a miscreant, the Napoleon of crime. That is who James Moriarty is!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Now then. We have about five minutes until the bullet is loaded into the tower.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> My calculations cannot be foiled. Not as long as Sherlock Holmes is out of commission.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> And he is now serving as my own source of power.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Holmes...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master...!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Archer, take up your weapons. You&#39;re going to help us, whether you want to or not.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> What, you planning for us to smash the meteor with our swords?</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> It&#39;s not just a meteor, it&#39;s a magical bullet. Our odds are all but nil, and I&#39;m not obligated to help.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> But, sure, why not. I achieved my goal. It doesn&#39;t matter to me when I die.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Master, we&#39;ll do our best to intercept the meteor.... Don&#39;t worry, Moriarty won&#39;t harm you.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Of course not. I would never do something so foolish after making it this far.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Stay here, Master.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...And remember, you have done nothing wrong. Of that, you can be certain.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> No need to console you, huh? I&#39;ll do my best, but knowing when to give up is important too, yeah?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> ...Heh. If you can still glare at me like that, you can last a while longer.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Most people in your position would have accepted their fate. No wonder you managed to save the world.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> You&#39;re a real piece of work.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> What about a forced Rayshift!?</p><p><strong>Staff B:</strong> It&#39;s no good! Now that the seventh bullet has been confirmed, the causality has been reinforced!</p><p><strong>Staff B:</strong> Shinjuku won&#39;t let Master Fujimaru jump to another time!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Don&#39;t give up yet! Try everything you possibly can!</p><p><strong>Staff B:</strong> Yes, ma&#39;am!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master...!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...You&#39;re awfully quiet for someone usually so talkative.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I&#39;ve already explained everything I need to. There is nothing left to say.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I see. Well, congratulations, Moriarty.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You sacrificed everything, and finally managed to beat Sherlock Holmes.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...I suppose so.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> To be honest, in less than five minutes, we&#39;ll have lost. So this may not be the best time to ask, but...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...I just can&#39;t bring myself to ask Master Fujimaru about it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Wait.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;ll tell you.</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Hm? What&#39;s this now?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Do you...regret this?</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...I have no right to answer that. What about you? Do you have any regrets?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Not a single one!</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Your obstinacy is remarkable.... Hm?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What is it, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I felt a breeze...</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> What!?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Tch!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Who are you!?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Hahahaha!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Regret!? To think the Napoleon of crime would have any regrets!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> You truly have fallen low, haven&#39;t you, Professor!?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> And yet this young [\u2642 man /\u2640 lady] doesn&#39;t regret anything!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> That&#39;s my accomplice for you!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Huh!?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...Well now. This is quite the unexpected entrance!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> And here I thought that impostor, Holmes, was the only one who had been summoned!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I know that laugh...!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Hahahaha! You recover quick, don&#39;t you!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A new Servant...Analyzing Spirit Origin...No way! It&#39;s the same Servant dressed in black we met back in the Temple of Time!</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> That&#39;s right! I am the Count of Monte Cristo! Good to see you again, my accomplice!</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> You seem down. You must have taken one hell of a beating!</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> But not to worry! I&#39;m here now!</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> And I&#39;ll accompany you all the way down to hell if that&#39;s where our path leads!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Well well, so you were alive too?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...Lovely.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> You don&#39;t seem happy to see me.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> The old Moriarty was way more expressive than you.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> I knew I should&#39;ve roasted your ass when I had the chance, old man.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Alter!</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> HEY! Why would you call me that of all things!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Jeanne...You&#39;re alive! Thank goodness!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Yup, sure am.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> I cut it real close, but at the last moment...you know.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I, um, I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t actually know.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Heh...Hehe...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That&#39;s right. Holmes told you to, uh...to watch your feet, if I recall.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Indeed he did! And thanks to that very advice...</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> She ended up diving straight into a manhole. Wonderful form, too.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Hey, I made damn sure to sterilize myself after!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> What&#39;re you lookin&#39; at me like that for!? If you got somethin&#39; to say, spit it out!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Oh...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> What? You want me to rub your shoulders or something? How &#39;bout I just freakin&#39; burn you alive instead!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> But that can wait a minute. Hey, Master, I brought backup.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Backup...?</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Well, I saved some chump, anyway.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> He&#39;s not gonna be much help, but he did say he had something to give you.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> In fact, I was originally summoned to protect him,and to work with him to save someone else.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Hahahaha! I&#39;ve finally been rescued, Master!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> I&#39;d love to express this joy in a sonnet, but that will have to wait.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> For the moment, William Shakespeare is back and fully recovered!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You really aren&#39;t going to be much help.</p><hr><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Ouch! You cut me to the quick!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> And here&#39;s the second unhelpful reinforcement. Some Shinjuku trip this turned out to be.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Here I was looking forward to visiting Kabukicho, only to find it in flames with strange dolls dancing as if possessed!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> What in the world were those!?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> All I wanted was to see overdressed people with pitch-black desires!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Well, if nothing else, I learned that moving mannequins are truly the stuff of nightmares.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Anyway, with no other choice, I holed up in an abandoned house waiting for just this moment!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...Well now, I certainly didn&#39;t account for you two in my calculations. Especially you, Andersen.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> You&#39;re telling me. But when a certain dumbass asked me for help, I just couldn&#39;t say no.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> By the way, I also have something for you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> For me?</p><hr><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> For you!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Sir Moriarty, I take it that Sherlock Holmes is no longer present in Shinjuku?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Seeing as you absorbed him!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Right you are.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> As long as Holmes&#39;s power is also yours, your power as an evil professor will never decline.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> After all, ordinarily, Holmes always beats you, but now, he&#39;s your ally.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Right now, professor, I imagine you must feel as though there is nothing you can&#39;t do.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Unstoppable, in other words. And it makes sense.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> If the story ensures that the protagonist wins, what better way to win than to become the protagonist?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...Stop right there, Shakespeare. What are you planning?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> History&#39;s greatest detective may have let down his guard for a moment, and allowed you to absorb him!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> But remember this well, villain!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> He blazed a path to a world in which thousands of skilled detectives followed in his wake.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Naturally, they too are Phantom Spirits. In a normal Holy Grail War, they wouldn&#39;t be worth summoning.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> However...</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Seriously! Thanks to that, we had to resort to a derivative work!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> It&#39;s nice that we didn&#39;t have to come up with any backstories, but the restrictions were a real pain!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Still, the client requested it, so I didn&#39;t have a choice. These scribbles may not be much, but they should more than suffice for summoning!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> And with that, it&#39;s time for a hastily written, slightly hackneyed turnabout story!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Now let me introduce you to everyone! This is the derivative work we spun up!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> They may not compare to the original, but at this point in time...</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> They shine brighter than any Heroic Spirit!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> \u201CM\xE4rchen Meines Lebens! \u201D A story just for you!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> It&#39;s not often I get to use this Noble Phantasm in this way! \u201CFirst Folio! \u201D</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> What the...!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> What&#39;s going on!? Mash, do you have any idea!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I may be a genius, but even I don&#39;t have the foggiest at the moment!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Servants are being summon\u2013 No, that&#39;s not it!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Their Spirit Origin values are too low. These are...Shadow Servants? And there&#39;s so many!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Their Noble Phantasms have summoned a hundred...no, two hundred of these...things!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Who are you all?</p><hr><p><strong>Round-Faced Priest:</strong> We are Phantom Spirits, Master of Chaldea. That is why we appear to be ghosts.</p><p><strong>Round-Faced Priest:</strong> The others are unable to even do that much, and are merely drifting around us.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You&#39;re...No way!</p><p><strong>Round-Faced Priest:</strong> Thankfully, we won&#39;t be fighting directly. We&#39;ll just be helping out Master a little bit.</p><p><strong>String-Fiddling Old Man:</strong> Part of me would like to argue in Moriarty&#39;s defense, but not when the planet&#39;s doom is near.</p><p><strong>Shaggy-Haired Professor:</strong> That&#39;s just like you, isn&#39;t it. That last one&#39;s a perfect betrayal.</p><p><strong>Shaggy-Haired Professor:</strong> Now, where&#39;d that Belgian get off to?</p><p><strong>Round-Faced Priest:</strong> I have a message from him.</p><p><strong>Round-Faced Priest:</strong> He says he already surpasses Holmes, so he won&#39;t be sticking his nose in.</p><p><strong>Round-Faced Priest:</strong> That said, he also said he will help us. One of these shadows must be him.</p><p><strong>Shaggy-Haired Professor:</strong> I see that detective&#39;s still too proud for his own good. Was it \u201Cgrey brain cells\u201D?</p><p><strong>Shaggy-Haired Professor:</strong> Brain cells are supposed to be pink. If they&#39;re grey, it means you&#39;re dead.</p><p><strong>Shaggy-Haired Professor:</strong> Never mind that. Exactly what should we do at this point? We&#39;ve practically already lost.</p><p><strong>Shaggy-Haired Professor:</strong> The numbers don&#39;t lie. Two and two will always be four, no matter what.</p><p><strong>Strait-Laced Gentleman:</strong> Not at all. We&#39;ve only just begun to fight.</p><p><strong>Strait-Laced Gentleman:</strong> Mister Holmes has left something important behind. That thing we always forget.</p><p><strong>Strait-Laced Gentleman:</strong> Of course, it&#39;s not my usual style, but oh well.</p><p><strong>String-Fiddling Old Man:</strong> I can&#39;t say I care for that. I mean, did Holmes himself ever try it out?</p><p><strong>Round-Faced Priest:</strong> Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s Master who will be doing it. Otherwise, [\u2642 he /\u2640 she] can&#39;t hope to defeat Moriarty.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Wait, what!?</p><hr><p><strong>Strait-Laced Gentleman:</strong> No need to fret! We are offering you our power. All you have to do is accept it.</p><p><strong>Strait-Laced Gentleman:</strong> From there, you will attack Moriarty. Nothing at all mysterious about it. In fact, it&#39;s quite scientific.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> W-wait! I, um...I think I can guess at your True Names.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But Master can&#39;t attack anyone!</p><p><strong>Round-Faced Priest:</strong> You&#39;re exactly right, young lady. And we too are incapable of attacking anyone physically.</p><p><strong>Round-Faced Priest:</strong> Even if we were Heroic or Phantom Spirits, it&#39;s just not in our nature.</p><p><strong>Round-Faced Priest:</strong> Our claim to fame is solving riddles, after all.</p><p><strong>String-Fiddling Old Man:</strong> Indeed.</p><p><strong>String-Fiddling Old Man:</strong> As if a bunch of forgotten old men like us could take part in combat.</p><p><strong>String-Fiddling Old Man:</strong> That&#39;s why you&#39;ll attack in a way that only we can. That&#39;s why we were summoned.</p><p><strong>Shaggy-Haired Professor:</strong> Okay, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Shaggy-Haired Professor:</strong> We will now lend you our power. And not just us.</p><p><strong>Strait-Laced Gentleman:</strong> Thanks to the great writers Shakespeare and Andersen, there are countless detectives here with us.</p><p><strong>Strait-Laced Gentleman:</strong> Some of us may have forms, and many may not, but we are all here nonetheless.</p><p><strong>String-Fiddling Old Man:</strong> And not only from Great Britain. Many of us have come from countries around the world as well.</p><p><strong>Round-Faced Priest:</strong> All of us have gotten up off our behinds and come together to help you: someone who would risk their own life to save a planet that is already outside the bounds of history.</p><p><strong>Phantom Spirit Detectives:</strong> Now, our power is yours!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...That&#39;s the scoop, Moriarty. Now go on, pick up your weapon.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> You&#39;re not real happy about this either, right? So go out with a bang. It&#39;ll take a bit of the sting out.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...Hahaha! So this is your last resort? Assembling a multitude of half-baked fictional detectives!?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Who do you think I am!?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I&#39;m James Moriarty! The only detective who could ever hold a candle to me is Sherlock Holmes!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Very well then. I don&#39;t know, nor do I care to know, what you&#39;re up to...but I&#39;ll fight you to the last!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> If you&#39;ve got detectives on your side, then I shall draw on the forces of evil to bolster my own power!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;ve confirmed the appearance of the Holy Grail! It seems like it was never used in the last battle!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Th-this magical energy is...as powerful as that of a Demon God Pillar! So he really wasn&#39;t fighting at his full strength before!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Guess he actually means business this time then!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master...Please, win!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Sorry, Master, but it looks like you&#39;ll be dying three minutes sooner than I expected. I trust you have no regrets, seeing as you&#39;re the one who chose this course of action!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> This time, I&#39;ll make sure to beat you!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> There&#39;s no way I&#39;m giving up!</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Then have at you!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Ngh...! I can&#39;t believe you overpowered me in this state!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> But, I haven&#39;t lost yet! ...Holy Grail! Give me all your strength!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A second wave!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> We won&#39;t survive another one!</p><p><strong>Round-Faced Priest:</strong> Now is the time.</p><p><strong>String-Fiddling Old Man:</strong> Indeed it is.</p><p><strong>Shaggy-Haired Professor:</strong> Fujimaru, I believe you already know what it is you have to say.</p><p><strong>Strait-Laced Gentleman:</strong> Those words are nothing less than our Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Phantom Spirit Detectives:</strong> Now, Master of Chaldea! Say it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> James Moriarty!</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You were the culprit behind this!</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You were the culprit behind this!</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...Ha. Haha.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Hahahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> That&#39;s your plan!? Yes, you&#39;re correct! I was the mastermind behind this whole incident.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I am the culprit!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Nghhh! The power, it&#39;s leaving me! And all because my culpability was proven!?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Aha, now I see.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Since I never left any evidence of my crimes behind,I was never once named as the culprit!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> So I didn&#39;t know that the moment I was unmasked\u2013the moment I lost to the detectives\u2013would weaken me like this...!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Still, it&#39;s strange...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Even with the power of so many great detectives on your side, I should have been able to defeat you.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Every calculation, every analysis bore that out. Magical energy, tactics, weapons...I should have been your superior in every respect.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> So then, why...? Why did I still lose!? Why!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Don&#39;t you get it?</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> No, I don&#39;t. Are you telling me you do, Master?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I, uh...I think I get it too.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Then please...do enlighten me. I cannot die without knowing.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Tell me...why did I lose!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Please tell him, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Think about it.</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You had fun, didn&#39;t you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Because you&#39;re a good guy.</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ......So that&#39;s it.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I thought I was fighting at full strength...but this is what was eating away at me all this time.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> It&#39;s the time I spent with all of you before regaining my memory...Now I see.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> If I had erased those memories, I would no longer have anyone I care about for the bullet to hit.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> So I couldn&#39;t get rid of them.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> But I know myself well. Even with them, I knew I would return to evil once my old memories came back.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Even if I had someone I cared about, I was sure I could cast them aside.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> That was what I thought...and yet...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Thank you. I understand now. No wonder I lost.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I understand evil well. I know the endless charm it holds.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> But...I had never once experienced being on the side of justice. Now I have, I feel...strange...It&#39;s perplexing...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> And I&#39;ll be damned...if it doesn&#39;t feel better than I thought!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Yes, I see it now. My failure was...inevitable!</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Archer, look...!</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Seems like something happened to the bullet! Guess we&#39;re just dealing with a regular meteor now!</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> I&#39;ll smash it, but it&#39;ll take everything I&#39;ve got. You can clean up the mess.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Fallen king or not, you should still have no trouble sweeping up a bunch of stardust, right?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> You, smash it? That&#39;s quite a proclamation. Can you really accomplish that with your little spells?</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> You bet I can. I may not be a great spellcaster, but that sort of thing&#39;s right up my alley.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> I&#39;ll use my Reality Marble.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Usually, I slip this thing designed to turn whole worlds upside down into an opponent&#39;s body.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> If we&#39;re just talking about fragmenting a meteor hell-bent on destroying Earth...it ought to do the trick.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Don&#39;t mess up.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Relax. Once a mercenary takes on a job, they make sure to see it through to the end.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> I am the bone of my sword.</p><p><strong>Staff B:</strong> It&#39;s no good! We can&#39;t Rayshift [\u2642 him /\u2640 her]!</p><p><strong>Staff C:</strong> Ten seconds until Bennu makes impact!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Rrrgh, come on, Servants! You&#39;re the only ones left who can save that world!</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Unlimited Lost Works!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Did he do it!? He did it, right!? Right!?</p><p><strong>Staff C:</strong> No, not yet!</p><p><strong>Staff C:</strong> Even the fragments are enough to obliterate Shinjuku, and there are so many!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Wait...He did it! I&#39;m sure of it! Can&#39;t you see!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I can!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> To swat a bullet from the sky, one needs a Divine Construct that stands above all other sacred swords.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Even if the one who wields that sword is consumed by darkness...</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...Vortigern, Hammer of the Vile King, reverse the rising sun.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> As long as Master is here, that light will never...</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Swallow the light, Excalibur Morgan!</p><p><strong>Staff C:</strong> Bennu is...completely destroyed!</p><p><strong>Staff B:</strong> Shinjuku&#39;s environmental parameters have returned to normal! Fujimaru can Rayshift home at any time!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master...We did it!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Oh well...It seems both of our dreams have been quite thoroughly crushed. Sorry, Bael.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> We were both one step away from fulfilling our goals. And yet, ironically, we ARE fulfilled now.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...At any rate, this may not mean much now that I&#39;ve lost, but...I&#39;m sorry, Master.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I hurt you, over and over again.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I twisted your integrity and your devotion to my own purposes, and used your naivete as a trap.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> But at least believe this:</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Those moments...The times we spent in the roost...The times we fought together.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Though that justice may have been embedded in me, at the time, I believed in it wholeheartedly.... However, that is not who I am now.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> So just think of me as a terrorist who merely happens to look like him.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;ll do that.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Good! I...he was a good person back then. At least, I think I was.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Not happening.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...You&#39;re a stubborn one, aren&#39;t you! All right, go ahead if that&#39;s what you want to do!</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Great detectives! Let me just say to you, from the bottom of my heart: go to hell!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Next time, I&#39;ll make sure you cannot possibly finger me as the culprit! I&#39;ll come up with a crime so perfect you&#39;ll never be able to pin it on me!</p><p><strong>Strait-Laced Gentleman:</strong> Thank you for the kind words. Now farewell.... There truly is nothing like science, is there.</p><p><strong>Shaggy-Haired Professor:</strong> I heartily concur. I say though, aren&#39;t you stealing my lines?</p><p><strong>Shaggy-Haired Professor:</strong> Well, we are both professors.</p><p><strong>String-Fiddling Old Man:</strong> ...Don&#39;t worry, you have your own personalities. Hmph, I can&#39;t believe they even summoned a gaudy old geezer like me.</p><p><strong>String-Fiddling Old Man:</strong> Thanks for that.</p><p><strong>Round-Faced Priest:</strong> Very well then, I believe I shall take my leave as well. Goodbye, everyone.</p><p><strong>Round-Faced Priest:</strong> And Moriarty: I hope you find happiness in your future.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> And what was that supposed to mean? Was it sarcasm?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I think he meant you may be summoned as a Servant?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That could definitely happen!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> No, it couldn&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Although...I do feel my position may be somewhat tenuous as I try to refute the notion...</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> I hope you get summoned. I don&#39;t want to be bothered with anything troublesome like this again!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> If another Servant shows up, it&#39;ll mean one less role for me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Want to try being summoned?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Don&#39;t be ridiculous.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...On second thought, maybe it&#39;s not so ridiculous, is it?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...Hmm. Maybe...it actually is...possible?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Of course it is! You&#39;ve already been recorded as a proper Servant!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> And, given how commendable the young Master is...</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> No more \u201CThey love not poison that do poison need. \u201DLet us say \u201CThey love poison that do poison need\u201D!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Or something thereabouts.</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I see. Then I suppose there&#39;s only one thing to be done.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Make sure you entertain me after I&#39;ve been summoned!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I will. I promise.</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Oh, there&#39;s no need to promise. Just keep it in mind.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> All right then! Au revoir!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> For a guy who took a ton of damage and was on the brink of death, he sure went out on a cheerful note...</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Perhaps he was just trying to save face.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> I imagine he thought he was doing us a favor by not subjecting us to a sappy farewell.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> You think? I think he just wanted to see the look on Master&#39;s face.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> That too is eminently possible.... Now then, I believe we had best be on our way as well!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Right you are, Shakespeare. I have deadlines to meet, after all.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> And only 28 days this month to meet them.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> ...Um, perhaps I should stay here a bit longer and do some research...</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Don&#39;t be a fool. We&#39;ve already started disappearing. If I go, I&#39;m taking you with me!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> C-coward!</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> I&#39;ve done what I was asked to do. I suppose I too had better be on my way.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Come to think of it, who asked you?</p><hr><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Heh...Never mind what Servant Shakespeare is like;as a playwright, he must have a lot of fans.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> I was taken aback to see how much worse things were than I had imagined, but...</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Having saved the world or not, it looks like you&#39;ve still got a long road ahead of you. In which case...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Call on you?</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Precisely!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Will I see you again?</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Absolutely. I have no doubt our paths will cross once more.</p><hr><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Remember this well, my accomplice: punishment, deserving or otherwise, is always a given.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> But you will never succumb to it! All you need do is call my name!</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Do that, and I will be at your side in a moment&#39;s notice! Hahahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...Finally, I can hear myself think again. Yeesh.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Just so you know...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;m glad you&#39;re alive.</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Could you not say weird things like that just as we&#39;re about to say goodbye?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Servants are supposed to die. That&#39;s how we&#39;re made.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> If you really grieved for us, you&#39;d be holding funerals, like, every day.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> I&#39;d agree with that.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Master of Chaldea, you&#39;re a little too good for your own good, if you know what I mean.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> HEY! Jerk! We were still talking! Don&#39;t butt in, ugh.... So what happened to that stupid king anyway?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Is it too much to hope she got squished by the meteor?</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> If you mean the King of Knights, she said she had somewhere she wanted to visit before she disappeared. Last I saw her, she was riding off on Cuirassier Alter.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Said she wasn&#39;t going to say goodbye, because we&#39;d see each other again.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Somewhere to visit?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...Aha. The dog.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I hope we do get to see her again.</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> This is why I can&#39;t stand her! For a king, her manners freakin&#39; suck!</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Ha ha. You sure you&#39;re one to talk about manners, country girl?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Don&#39;t lump me in with you lot.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Fine. In that case, I&#39;ll see myself out.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Oh, and Master of Chaldea? Your leadership wasn&#39;t half bad.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> The next time I&#39;m summoned, I&#39;ll lend you a hand if we&#39;re not enemies.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> For a price, of course.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> In other words, he&#39;s just another mercenary. Ah well, at least he didn&#39;t name a price.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Rayshift preparations are complete. Master, are you ready to\u2013</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Yah!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Mash!?</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...Don&#39;t worry. It&#39;s just me.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...What&#39;s with that look? Ugh!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Come on, stand up straight! Shoulders back!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> There. That&#39;s it.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1AJeanne Alter:</strong> Okay Master, now...dance.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Dance?</p><hr><p><strong>F\uFF1AJeanne Alter:</strong> Yes! D-A-N-C-E, dance! Now come on.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1AJeanne Alter:</strong> I wanna do that thing you did with the stupid king before fighting the Assassin!</p><p><strong>F\uFF1AJeanne Alter:</strong> It&#39;s not fair she got to and I didn&#39;t! Or are you too good to dance with a girl from the country!?</p><p><strong>F\uFF1AJeanne Alter:</strong> ...You&#39;re not? Th-then go on, lead!</p><p><strong>F\uFF1AJeanne Alter:</strong> Ugh, you&#39;re so inconsiderate. And aren&#39;t you kind of close? You better not be smelling my breath, you weirdo.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1AJeanne Alter:</strong> Huh? This is normal in dancing? ...W-well, okay then...</p><p><strong>F\uFF1AJeanne Alter:</strong> Good, now she and I are even. Take that, ice bitch queen.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1AJeanne Alter:</strong> Did I only dance to get back at her? No, you idiot. I danced &#39;cause I wanted to.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1AJeanne Alter:</strong> What&#39;s with the grin? I&#39;ll burn you, you see if I don&#39;t.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1AJeanne Alter:</strong> Okay, that should do it. I&#39;m satisfied now. Besides, I&#39;m already disappearing.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1AJeanne Alter:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>F\uFF1AJeanne Alter:</strong> All right, guess this is it. I&#39;ll try to practice a little more before I see you again.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1AJeanne Alter:</strong> So you better do the same...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Welcome back, Master!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fou!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That was quite the ordeal, wasn&#39;t it, Fujimaru!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> There&#39;s a lot I&#39;d like to discuss, but first, I think you&#39;ve earned a hot shower and a good rest!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um, Senpai? When the connection cut off suddenly a little while ago...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Did something happen then?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Not telling!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, come on, Senpai! Please tell me!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou fou!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Okay, that should take care of that rather sudden Analyze Lost Order! Good work, everyone!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AStaff B:</strong> Th-thank goodness...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Now then...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Care to tell me what brings you here?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Well, I did just suffer a crushing defeat. And at the hands of my nemesis, no less!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> So I thought I would stay here awhile and reflect on my missteps. If that&#39;s all right with you?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> My Spirit Origin values were already so low after numerous Rayshifts that I wasn&#39;t much use in battle.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> But this latest bout of damage was so severe that I&#39;d be nothing more than a burden now. For the time being, I need to be more of an armchair detective.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...So, you have something you want to investigate. Sure thing. I&#39;ll go ahead and issue you a permit.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Precisely! I knew Leonardo da Vinci would understand right away. Oh, and I also have some news to share.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> When Moriarty absorbed me, I used him to make off with some information.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> It turns out he and Bael had quite a lot to discuss.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> In particular, there is one thing of crucial importance: there are still living Demon God Pillars.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...Go on.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Three of them, to be precise. But I&#39;m afraid I know neither their names, nor the time periods in which they exist.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> They only survived that battle by giving up and running for their lives.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Although there are only three of them, they are not united in the goal of incinerating humanity.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Rather, they each have their own desires, and are hiding out in this world in different times.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That would mean...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Indeed. Both the Incineration of Humanity and the Shinjuku Phantom Incident cases have been solved.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> However...there are still riddles in this world that have yet to be solved!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> And furthermore, there&#39;s one other thing that&#39;s nagging at me.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> What&#39;s that?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> ......</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> ...On second thought, I&#39;d better save that for a later point.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Gah! So this is what it feels like when someone pulls that on you!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I&#39;m glad you enjoyed it. Now then, I&#39;d better get down to business.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Perhaps I&#39;ll even help you falsify your data if the mood takes me.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I do specialize in mixing truth with lies to logical ends, after all.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hmm. You know, from an objective perspective, we geniuses are kind of infuriating, aren&#39;t we!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AStaff A:</strong> (Yup. )</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AStaff B:</strong> (Yup. )</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> What&#39;s with the cold stares?</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> This is the last time I can feed you.

But don&#39;t feel sad.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> You&#39;re free now, Cavall II. You can live out your days as a stray, or choose a new owner.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Whatever you decide, I&#39;m certain you&#39;ll be fine. Thank you for standing guard all this time.</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Altria Alter:</strong> Now go.
