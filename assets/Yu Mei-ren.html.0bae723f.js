Give me that magazine you&#39;re reading.</p><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> What? You&#39;re still reading it? Why should that be any of my concern?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Now I see. Okay, here you go.</p><hr><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> Fujimaru, give me a shoulder rub.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Would you rather I go firmly or gently?</p><hr><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> Wh-what&#39;s wrong with you!? Don&#39;t you have any pride as a Master at all?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um, I don&#39;t think getting upset like that will do much besides make Senpai feel bad...</p><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> The whole POINT of this is to make [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her} feel bad!</p><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> And I&#39;m upset because it isn&#39;t working!</p><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> How can you just go along with whatever I say like that?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Well, I can&#39;t turn down requests from my own senpai, so...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Gil always says it&#39;s good to go along to get along, so...</p><hr><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> Are you too stupid to be humiliated or something!? Is this all just a joke to you!?</p><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> Th-this is exactly why I hate humans! I swear, what are you even thinking!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> And...off she goes, all angry...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yu Mei-ren was always kind of mysterious, even when she went by Akuta Hinako...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...but now that she&#39;s a Servant, she&#39;s become even more... How can I put this...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> She&#39;s just as introverted as ever, but now she&#39;s much more...aggressive about it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I think she&#39;s still processing everything that happened.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Maybe she&#39;s just more easily flustered than she looks?</p><hr><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> Thanks for coming all this way, Prince of Lan Ling.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Not at all. Whatever strange circumstances may have led to our reunion at Chaldea, I am delighted to see you again.</p><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> ...Oh, right. Um, what was the last memory you have of me again...?</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Your presence in the final moments of my life, of course.</p><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> R-right, of course. I knew that, but... Ugh, this Servant thing is so confusing...</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> So what is it you wished to talk to me about?</p><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> Well, it&#39;s something I can&#39;t discuss with any of the other Heroic Spirits. See...</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> You&#39;re not sure how to behave around Master?</p><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> That&#39;s right. It&#39;s, you know... It&#39;s been a long time since I last spent time with humans who are...aware of what I truly am.</p><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> Even now that I&#39;ve chosen to become a Servant, I never know how to act whenever I&#39;m actually face-to-face with [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her}.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> I see. So that&#39;s why you came to me...</p><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> Yes. You were the only other human who knew what I was and still wasn&#39;t afraid to be around me.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> I see. In that case, I would ask that you begin by changing your clothes.</p><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> Huh? My clothes? Were you even listening to me? What do my clothes have to do with any of this?</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> ...Change your clothes. We will talk after that.</p><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> O-okay, okay... (I-I&#39;ve never seen him be so assertive before...)</p><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> There, I changed. Happy now?</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Yes, thank you. Forgive my bluntness, but seeing you dressed like that, I could not hear your concerns about acting appropriately as anything but a joke.</p><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> A-a joke!? What&#39;s your problem!? [\u2642 He /\u2640\uFE0F She} knows what I am now, so who cares how I dress!?</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> There. That attitude of yours\u2013the ceaseless, unwarranted indignation\u2013that is the problem.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> You have always been innocent by nature, like a flower, or the wind.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> I can scarcely imagine how exhausting it must have been for you to hide who you truly are just to blend in with humanity....</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> ...but as soon as your immortality is revealed...</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> ...you simply begin acting however you please, without the slightest regard for anyone else.</p><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> I... Well... You know...</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> You have become far too accustomed to killing anyone who saw through your false identity.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> You may know how to live apart from human society, but if you wish to coexist peacefully with a human for any period of time...</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> ...you must learn a measure of self-control.</p><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> Nnn...</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> ...No matter how frustrating you may find doing so.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Our Master may be young, but [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she} is both highly virtuous and incredibly understanding.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> [\u2642 He /\u2640\uFE0F She} will always accept you as you are. Of that, I have no doubt.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> But that accommodating nature also means [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she} is just as likely to treat you like a lunatic if you simply keep doing whatever you please.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> If you wish to have a positive relationship with [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her}...</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> ...you must show that you are willing to at least try to behave somewhat normally.</p><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> ...You don&#39;t get it. I know [\u2642 he&#39;s /\u2640\uFE0F she&#39;s} a good person. I&#39;m not about to question that after everything that&#39;s happened.</p><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> The problem is that our history is kind of...complicated?</p><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> Ugh, this is such a pain. I can&#39;t believe I have to explain all this to you, of all people.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> What&#39;s so complicated about it? Is [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she} the descendant of a clan you have history with or something?</p><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> I wish. No, I knew [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her} personally, before all this happened.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Huh? ...Ah, now I see.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Given how long you&#39;ve lived, I suppose this sort of thing was bound to happen at some point. This IS a tricky problem.</p><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> Say you were summoned as a Servant by an enemy and ordered to fight against the emperor you served when you were alive. How would you feel?</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Oh! That&#39;s... Well, I would certainly do my best to carry out my orders, but...</p><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> That&#39;s basically what it&#39;s like for me now.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Hmm. This problem is more than any human could hope to solve. I am afraid that my own very limited perspective on this may not be of much help...</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Wait, I know. Chaldea is home to a number of Divine Spirits as well as human Heroic Spirits.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> They should offer perspectives that transcend human notions of fate. Why not ask them for advice?</p><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> Hmm, maybe... I guess they&#39;d be easier to talk to than a human Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Then come with me. I&#39;ll introduce you to them right now.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> So the goddesses we asked for advice all said we should talk to you.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Oh, for... I wish they&#39;d cut me some slack.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> I neither run a failed Servant consultation room nor am I a beast-taming caf\xE9 owner...</p><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> Don&#39;t be ridiculous. One look at you and it&#39;s clear you&#39;d be right at home in an apron, and if you come recommended by multiple Divine Spirits, then you must be the right Servant for the job.</p><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> Apparently, you&#39;re one of the few other Heroic Spirits in all of Chaldea who lived in modern times.</p><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> So? Have you ever met anyone as a Servant that you held a grudge against when you were human?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> ... (Would rather be anywhere but here)</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Hm? Oh, sorry. I was expecting MUCH more lecturing before you came to the point.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> So, just to be clear, you&#39;re asking if I&#39;ve ever met someone as both a human and a Servant?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Of course not.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Even if I had, I would have forgotten all about it when I went back to the Throne.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> So your question is pretty pointless, really.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Even if that did happen, I&#39;m a Servant, so I&#39;d never remember it anyway.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Please, humor us. Let&#39;s say, for the sake of argument...</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> ...you ran into someone now, in Chaldea, who you absolutely couldn&#39;t stand when you were alive.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> What do you think you would do?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> ... (Would rather be anywhere but here)</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Is... Am I being pranked here? Do you have a hidden camera or something?</p><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> This is not a prank. I&#39;m serious. And so were the goddesses who recommended you.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> ...(Sigh) All right, fine. We&#39;re talking PURELY hypothetical here, right? Just a thought experiment?</p><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> Yes. Besides, I&#39;m sure the goddesses who pointed me your way had a good idea of how you would respond.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> All right, if you insist...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Truth be told...there was someone I had serious issues with back when I was alive.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> But now that I&#39;m part of the Counter Force, I don&#39;t see any point in holding on to things like that.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> I can&#39;t see them changing at all, just like I&#39;m not about to change who I am now.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Any disagreements or grudges I might have had in life all stopped when I died.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Now that I&#39;m part of the Foundation of Humanity, I can&#39;t do anything about them, for good or bad.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> I&#39;m...not really sure how I arrived at that conclusion, unfortunately, but it&#39;s where I am now.</p><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> I see...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Still, you can&#39;t help feeling how you feel. If you just can&#39;t get over it... Hmm...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Well, as long as it doesn&#39;t cause trouble for anyone else, you could always just fight them.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> It might not accomplish much, but it should help settle your differences for the moment.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> After that, you can start to build a new relationship based on where you are now, not where you were before.</p><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> ...So after thinking over Emiya&#39;s invaluable advice, Fujimaru...</p><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> ...I really do feel bad about this, but I have decided to fight you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I almost forgot she knew how to smile...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Give me a break...</p><hr><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Forgive me. I had no idea it would come to this...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> I was very careful to mention that she shouldn&#39;t make trouble for anyone, but I forgot that vampires don&#39;t really have the same idea of common sense.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> We blood-sucking types do come in all shapes and sizes, but one thing we have in common is that restraint is not in our vocabulary.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> That said, we do not have the right to stop you, so please, go right ahead.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> I promise you I will do everything in my power to ensure your safety. Also, this mock battle will be great for collecting data!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Wait, please. Senpai still needs to steel [\u2642 himself /\u2640\uFE0F herself} for this...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Exactly. I want to see what being forced to fight in a situation where there is no good reason to do so...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> ...does to Fujimaru&#39;s mental state and combat ability.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> We are sure to run into this sort of thing in future Lostbelts.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> So I am not going to miss this chance to sample data from a perfect test case!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I guess there&#39;s no getting out of this, then...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Well, if nothing else, I&#39;ll be here beside you, Master! If we&#39;re going to do this, let&#39;s do it!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> Hey! Hold on! Something&#39;s not right!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Hmm? What do you mean? It looks to me as if you have finally managed to warm up.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> No need to worry. Both of your emotional graphs are crystal clear!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Keep going and I am sure you will both achieve a mutual understanding, either as close friends or lifelong rivals!</p><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> Do you science types not have even the vaguest notion of how people work!?</p><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> This is only making me angrier!!! What is going on!?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> How is this suddenly my fault?</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> You have my sympathies. Yu here can be rather, um...difficult, at times...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Your whole problem&#39;s that you ain&#39;t on equal footing.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Mordred?</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> That&#39;s right. What chance is there at a fair fight between a Servant and a Master? None.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> If you&#39;re going to compete with one another, you need to do so in an arena where you are more equal.</p><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> What do you mean by that, Assassin?</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> Why not try going up against Fujimaru as a Master yourself again?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh? That&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> You were a Master with a Servant of your own back in that Lostbelt, yeah? You could make it a whole Master-on-Master rematch.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Seems like that&#39;d be the way to go if you want a knock-down, drag-out fight with Fujimaru here.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> That&#39;s why we went around getting that Lostbelt gang back together.</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong> This. Quite the strange twist. But I. Have no. Objections. To this plan. When in doubt. Let the fists do. The talking.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> Oppression? Is there oppression here?</p><p><strong>Red Hare:</strong> A race to see which side can wipe the other out first! What fun!</p><p><strong>Red Hare:</strong> Oh, though of course, I expect to be rewarded for my combat prowess. Tamamo said there would be a carrot in this for me! Neigh ha!</p><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> Ugh. Just having all of them in one place is going to give me an ulcer...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> While we&#39;re at it, might as well admit there&#39;s no fun in a rematch that just repeats the original, not when we&#39;ve got this fancy-schmancy simulator.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> So, let&#39;s swap the parties around this time?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Wh-what do you mean?</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> All the Servants Fujimaru commanded back then will fight for Yu Mei-ren this time...</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> ...and [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she} will command the Prince of Lan Ling in their place.</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong> How fascinating. I would. Enjoy seeing. Fujimaru&#39;s tactics. From a. Different perspective.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> M-me, fight against Senpai? I... That&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Ah, quit bitchin&#39;. Not like it&#39;s a real battle anyway. &#39;Sides, don&#39;tcha think it&#39;d be fun to mix things up?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Who knows? Once you get to experience how much ass Fujimaru kicks firsthand, you might even end up falling for [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her} all over again.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I... Um...</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> So I will be fighting for [\u2642 Lord /\u2640\uFE0F Lady} Fujimaru as part of this switch...</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Then, that would mean that I was fighting against [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her} in that Lostbelt...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Don&#39;t worry about it, Prince of Lan Ling. The key to making it as a Servant here is not thinking about that stuff too much.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Anyway, I&#39;ve played my part, right? So I&#39;m gonna get out of here.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> There&#39;s a few bigmouthed goddesses I&#39;ve still gotta give a piece of my mind.</p><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> Fine. Let&#39;s do this, then! A Lostbelt rematch? Bring it on!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Well, well! It is not every day one gets to see such sloppy tactics!</p><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> When did you get so strong, Prince of Lan Ling!? Were you holding out on me back in the Lostbelt!?</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> I&#39;m afraid I am not sure how to answer that...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Oh, unbunch your panties, lady. You just aren&#39;t cut out for the Master stuff.</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong> It must have been. So hard. For you. Prince of Lan Ling.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> What say we go get a drink later, Prince of Lan Ling? My treat.</p><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> Oh, and now you are all going to gang up on me!? What was wrong with my orders, anyway? I supported you all just fine!</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> This is more than mere orders or oppression. I cannot fathom your methods, having us all use our Noble Phantasms on an opponent who evaded them so easily...</p><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> That&#39;s why I pinned him down! To make sure he wouldn&#39;t get away!</p><p><strong>Red Hare:</strong> I really must say that having our Master put the enemy Servant in a full nelson is more of a hindrance than a help. How could we attack properly with you there? My Noble Phantasm doesn&#39;t horse around!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Hmm. This certainly demonstrates one reason for your success in the Chinese Lostbelt, Fujimaru...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Something still seems strange, though.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> According to the data I imported from Chaldea, Akuta Hinako on Team A was supposed to be a masterful tactician.</p><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> A-and I am! I&#39;m just a little off my game today, that&#39;s\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh right. Holmes went through all of that data and it turned out to be falsified.</p><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> He did what!? Oh, I am going to find him later and rip him limb from gangly limb...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Yeah... We actually figured all this out in the Lostbelt.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> You might be a decentish Servant, Yu Mei-ren, but you suck as a Master.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> It&#39;s as if the notion of relying on anyone else is wholly alien to you.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> Don&#39;t know how long you lived, but I&#39;m guessing in all that time, you never once fought as part of a team.</p><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> Gnnn...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I have a whole new level of appreciation for how hard you must have worked to compensate for your Master, Prince of Lan Ling...</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> I wouldn&#39;t say that. I can&#39;t speak for how I felt at the time, since I have no memory of it, but I think I would have been proud to fight for her.</p><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Knowing that, in your time of need, you chose me out of other possible Servants, would have been enough.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> I&#39;m honored you kept the promise you made so long ago.</p><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> Well, you know... I couldn&#39;t exactly summon Lord Xiang Yu, so...</p><p><strong>Xiang Yu:</strong> Indeed. I could not be a Heroic Spirit without you.</p><p><strong>Xiang Yu:</strong> I must thank you once again for giving me this chance to serve as a guardian of humanity, my beloved.</p><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> Xia? Xia-Xia-Xia-Xia-Xia...</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong> Gesundheit.</p><p><strong>Xiang Yu:</strong> I now understand the point of this simulated battle. But if we are to properly reverse the situation from that time...</p><p><strong>Xiang Yu:</strong> ...should I not also join Fujimaru&#39;s party, and follow [\u2642 his /\u2640\uFE0F her} orders myself?</p><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> Huh!? No! Wh-wh-wh-what are you saying, Lord Xiang Yu!?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> You know, you make an excellent point. All right, I will update the settings, and we can go another round!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Ahahaha! Oh man, I know what&#39;s gonna happen but I still can&#39;t wait to see it!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Try to actually put up a fight this time, will ya, Master!?</p><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> Noooooo!!!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mordred &amp; Nezha &amp; Mash:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Jing Ke &amp; Red Hare &amp; Spartacus:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> Fujimaru, you coward!</p><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> Y-y-you know there&#39;s no way I could attack Lord Xiang Yu, even in a virtual battle!</p><p><strong>Yu Mei-ren:</strong> What kind of sick, twisted Master are you!? I hate you! I wish you and the whole world would just die!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Well, that was certainly dramatic...</p><hr><p><strong>Xiang Yu:</strong> Forgive me, everyone. I should have been more considerate.</p><p><strong>Xiang Yu:</strong> I thought calculations were unnecessary for battles between brutes, and thus neglected to predict this future...</p><p><strong>Xiang Yu:</strong> Of course, my beloved is not a brute, but a delicate lady. Given her mild temperament, I should have known this would happen, even without foresight...</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> (...Delicate lady?)</p><p><strong>Red Hare:</strong> (...Mild temperament?)</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> [\u2642 Lord /\u2640\uFE0F Lady} Fujimaru, I, um, I&#39;m not quite sure what to say...</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> As you know, the circumstances of her summoning were somewhat...unusual.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> I am sure she will continue to behave poorly as a result, but I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive her...</p><p><strong>Xiang Yu:</strong> Oh, that reminds me, Master. While we are here, let me pay you back for this past week.</p><p><strong>Xiang Yu:</strong> Four yakisoba bread, three magazines, other miscellaneous expenses... That&#39;s two point seven million QP altogether. Here you go.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> S-Senpai...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Thanks, see you next week.</p><hr><p><strong>Xiang Yu:</strong> No problem at all. I appreciate you setting your prices so generously. Thank you again for being so kind to my beloved.</p><p><strong>Xiang Yu:</strong> Now then, if you will excuse me.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> ...Master, I think we need to talk.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Oh, uh, sure...</p><hr><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> You may be a Master dealing with one of your Servants, but even so...</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> ...if you&#39;re going to engage in trade with someone unfamiliar with fair market prices, isn&#39;t it only right that you not take advantage of them?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Well, uh, he said he wanted to reward me for my help, so...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> He said it was the least he could do, and it sort of spiraled from there...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m sorry...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Don&#39;t worry, I put all the extra QP aside...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh good. Then that takes care of everything!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It looks like you still have all the receipts, so we can go over them and return the extra QP to Xiang Yu.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Have Yu Mei-ren give it back to him instead. Maybe seeing how much her man&#39;s been spending on her will embarrass the bitchiness out of her.</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong> I strongly. Discourage that. Course of action. Even if. She did. Cause this situation. Herself. Such a gesture. Would be too. Provocative. She might. Change. Her class to Avenger. As a response. To that.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> Honestly, I&#39;m kind of worried for them now. Just imagine if Caesar or David find out what easy marks they are...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I know it won&#39;t be easy to help Akuta\u2013Yu Mei-ren overcome her distrust of humans.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We&#39;ll have to be patient and let her gradually get used to life as a Chaldean Servant on her own terms.</p>',270),a=[s];function i(g,h){return o(),t("div",null,a)}var u=e(r,[["render",i],["__file","Yu Mei-ren.html.vue"]]);export{u as default};
