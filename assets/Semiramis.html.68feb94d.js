His only request was that she be with him when he passed.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> She had learned song and dance to curry favor with men. But the old man smiled and said she was free to sing and dance to her heart&#39;s content...not to please anyone save herself.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> It was a quiet, gentle love.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> But, it didn&#39;t last. By the end, it was trampled beyond recognition.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> She doesn&#39;t regret what happened. But...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...she still sometimes dreams about what might have been.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> One, two, three...</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fou, fou.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Come in!</p><hr><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> I do beg your pardon, Master! Ah, I see you were working out.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou.</p><p><strong>Dove:</strong> Coo, coo.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fouoo!?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Indeed.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> This dove has taken residence upon my head and quite adamantly refuses to depart.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m glad you two are having fun.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Setting aside my ceaseless worry over when it might defecate on my head, I suppose I am!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What&#39;s the harm? It&#39;s cute.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Do you speak of me, [\u2642 sir /\u2640\uFE0F madam}, or the bird?</p><hr><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> In any case, it seems this dove&#39;s demeaning deportment was demanded by that despotic, diabolical debutante. That is, the empress.</p><p><strong>Dove:</strong> Coo, coo.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Is that a letter tied around its leg?</p><hr><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> That it is. An old fashioned sort, isn&#39;t she?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> But then I suppose she ought to be, as the world&#39;s oldest known poisoner.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I wonder what this is about...?</p><hr><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Ah, it seems the letter was bewitched with a small spell to let her know once it is read.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Come see me with the playwright within thirty seconds of reading this letter.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Fail to do so, and I will trap you both in an illusion that will have you stripping down to bathe in the dining hall.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> How did I come to be ensnared in all this!?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Well, I certainly have no desire to denude myself in the dining hall.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> There you are, Master.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Hmm. Thirty-two seconds...</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Very well, then. I am generous enough to grant you a two-second grace period.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Th-thank...you...</p><hr><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> (Gasp, gasp)... So...? (huff, huff)... What did...(wheeze, wheeze)...you want to...(breathing hard)</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Are you gasping for breath? How can a Servant be that out of shape?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Well...I am a playwright, so...</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Hmm. Well, no matter.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Now, let us get down to business.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Shakespeare, I seem to faintly recall your Noble Phantasm can recreate the past?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Oho, I&#39;m delighted you know my Noble Phantasm&#39;s true purpose!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Indeed, my Noble Phantasm recreates the past, exposes one&#39;s hidden sins, and metes out justice for them.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Every hero or monster has a point in their past when they were powerless, whether that past is mythical, legendary, or historical.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> My Noble Phantasm zeroes in on that point and uses it to break their spirit.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> ...Hmm.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> But, I suppose it could also be used to merely recreate the past.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Hmm, I see... Very well. To my next question, then.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Can your Noble Phantasm change the past once it has recreated it?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Oho? And what exactly might you mean by that?</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Simple.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Were I to make a different choice in that recreated past, would it continue to unfold accordingly?</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> ...I understand that what is done is done. One cannot change reality.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> But is it possible for your Noble Phantasm to reveal a possible alternate path the future might have taken?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Hmmmmmm. Good question.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> I suppose I could ad-lib something based on your reactions, but the future would become something of my own creation more than anything else, really.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> And surely that is not what you seek.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> In which case, our only option is to trust your memories of the person in question.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> That is to say, the actions they would take in response to yours...</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> ...would depend entirely on how well you understand them.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Hmm.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> I take it this means you have something in your past you wish to change, Empress!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> If I might hazard a guess at exactly what this is about...</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> ...perhaps you grieve for your husband General Onnes&#39;s untimely death? Or perhaps you feel remorse for killing King Ninus?</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> ... ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (Huh? Is that not what this is about?)</p><hr><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> True, I suppose it could be amusing to try this with them first.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Very well, I grant you permission to use your Noble Phantasm on me.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Master, this hardly need be said, but you will be coming with me as well.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Master, just to be certain, is it all right with you for me to use my Noble Phantasm?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> As long as you do it in the combat simulator.</p><hr><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Indeed. I have no wish to involve all of Chaldea in this exercise.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> The simulator would be a better setting for this.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Understood! All right, I should be ready in about...two or three hours.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> That long?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Ordinarily, I would prefer several days to prepare.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> But fortunately, Chaldea has a rich store of information about Heroic Spirits I may peruse.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> If I am to recreate the past faithfully, I must immerse myself in the culture and civilization of the time.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> And above all...I need to understand why things happened the way they did.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Now then, I will see you again in two to three hours!</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Tch... Very well. If that is what you must do, I will allow it.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> In the meantime, Master, you will stay here and converse with me as my host.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Huh!?</p><hr><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> What do you mean \u201Chuh\u201D? Do you have a problem with that? Then you leave me no choice.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Let the illusion begi\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I would be delighted to stay with you!</p><hr><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Good, good. I thought that might be the case.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Now then, where to begin... Why don&#39;t we start with the differences between magecraft and curses?</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> It should be most educational for you. Hehehe, now, now, do not look so disappointed.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> I guided my people for a long time as an empress. I will be sure to explain these concepts simply, yet thoroughly.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> There we are! My apologies for the wait. ...I say, is everything all right, Master?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> You look like a student on the verge of failing [\u2642 his /\u2640\uFE0F her} entrance exams for the last option on [\u2642 his /\u2640\uFE0F her} list of backup schools!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Okay, so these are cuneiform characters...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> The special activation requirements for curses are...</p><hr><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> It is nothing of consequence.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> No matter how green a mage one might be, there is no harm in learning about what they may one day experience.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Even if the flower has yet to bloom, the seed will continue to grow. That will do for now.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> I see you aren&#39;t much for hands-on education, Empress.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> You misunderstand.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Hands-on education has its place, but it never hurts to broaden one&#39;s options.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Furthermore, it is important to know what one is capable of, and what one is not.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> It is a sin to fret over a decision, and it is a sin to fixate on but a single choice.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> I see, I see. Very good then.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Now, are you ready? Do you need anything from me?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Not at all, my good empress! From here on, my only role is to serve as the voice of the heavens. Which is to say, I shall be your narrator!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Master shall play the advisory jester, and of course, you shall be the hero of the story.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Good. Master, I think we can take a break from your studies for a while.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Start up the combat simulator, and we shall make our way to my home, Assyria.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Hmm. This recreation is lacking in some of the finer details, but I suppose I should expect no better.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Indeed, this is the best we can do with only the library&#39;s information to go on.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> All right, if our capable assistant is now ready, shall we begin?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m all set here, Master, and Shakespeare.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Ah, Mash. Very well, I am counting on you to navigate for us.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Don&#39;t worry, Semiramis, leave it to me!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Then I believe it is time for my Noble Phantasm!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Ahem. Since it has been quite a long time, I hope you will allow me a few (meaningless) opening remarks!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Yes, yes! The curtain on my Noble Phantasm is about to rise! Please take your seats and extinguish your cigarettes! Remember, there is to be no photography, and absolutely no heckling!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> All the world&#39;s a stage, and this world, my oyster!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Life is but a walking shadow; a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> As the curtain rises, the applause shall be like thunder... First Folio!</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> ...Oh?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Ngh... Nnngh...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Are you okay?</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong> Oh, yes, I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m just a little stressed.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> You see, I&#39;m about to go meet my new wife, and she&#39;s over thirty years younger than me...</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> ...And what&#39;s wrong with that?</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> If she is so much younger, then you will not lack for companionship for the rest of your days.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> ...Not to mention that, as your wife, she will surely care for you in your old age.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> That&#39;s exactly why I feel so bad.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I felt bad that she had no other family besides her adoptive father, so I agreed to take her, in something of a fatherly fashion myself...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> But if she marries me, she will never be able to choose a lover for herself.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Couldn&#39;t she have an affair?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I doubt it.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> She was brought up to be chaste and faithful. I don&#39;t think she would ever dream of having an affair.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> ...Then, are you going to let her go?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> If...if only it were that simple...!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> But it isn&#39;t...and the way things are going now...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m going to rob her of any chance of happiness!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What was that...?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, yes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m so sorry, everyone.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Whenever I have the character you&#39;re talking to swell with emotion, it causes a change in his virtual Spirit Origin.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> In other words, he&#39;s gradually becoming an enemy! If you keep talking to him, you might end up having to figh\u2013</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> That&#39;s all right. Good elder, let me give you some advice.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> You are working yourself up over nothing. That woman has no choice but to marry you.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> If even an older man like you will not marry her now...</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> ...everyone will think there is something wrong with her.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> From there, it will only be a matter of time until her life is all but destroyed.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Ah, ahhh... It&#39;s my fault... It&#39;s all my fault...!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Aah! Aaaaaah!</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> ...It seems we have no choice but to help him calm down.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Master, you will give the orders. But, please, do not kill him.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> And Shakespeare?</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Yes? What is it?</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Don&#39;t you \u201Cwhat is it?\u201D me. This is your mess, so you can at least help clean it up.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Very well! Though I must say, there is very little I can do against enemies of this sort!</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> So I shall be taking to my heels once I have sent a few buffs your way!</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> That will do. Now, come, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>???:</strong> It&#39;s all...my fault...</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> You are mistaken, good elder.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Had you not married her, she would have died without so much as a name.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> ...Yes, that&#39;s right. This was the best choice I could make.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Allow me to apologize to you on her behalf.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Your life would have been a happier one had you not married her.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> In exchange for her hand, you will end your days in desperation.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...Yes. I know.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> But I don&#39;t mind. As long as Semiramis is happy, that&#39;s all that matters to me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh...!?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> That&#39;s all I...</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Hmm. I suppose I should have known it would not be that easy.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um... Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but was that\u2013</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> You mean you didn&#39;t know? That was my ex-husband. In modern terms, we used to...hook up? No, that sounds...wrong.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> I was all alone at the time, so I didn&#39;t care what he was like as long as he was willing to marry me...</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> ...but he was a far better man than I had ever imagined. I&#39;d been prepared for the worst, so it was shocking how easily we got along.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> ...Of course, as I alluded to earlier, our end was not a happy one.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> There was a man by the name of Ninus who fell in love with me the moment he saw me.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Ninus took me from Onnes, and Onnes ended up taking his own life in despair.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So you wanted to change the past to help him?</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> ...No. I would never be who I am now if he had not married me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> So you wanted to see what a different future might have been like?</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> There may have been a future where he did not end up dying in misery.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> But in that future, I would have been lost to history, never having had a name.</p><hr><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Still...this old man is an indelible part of my memories.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> I merely thought that, if it were possible to save him...</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> ...I might even go so far as to entrance a saint.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Hmph, I need not have bothered. People never change.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> They hold fast to ideals of change, yet also see beauty in remaining steadfast.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> In the end, any change is but illusion. An illusion that it seems I fell prey to, however briefly.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> Hmm.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> It seems there is a greater story there, but I doubt it has anything to do with me.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> So, if you had chosen differently, you could have lived out your life peacefully, as one of the common folk.</p><p><strong>Shakespeare:</strong> I would have thought that idea would hold great appeal for an empress, and yet you dismissed it out of hand!</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Of course.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> I am happy enough as a Servant. I need not seek my happiness elsewhere.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> I am sorry for bringing you along on this, Master. It seems this was a waste of time.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I don&#39;t mind.</p><hr><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Hehe, you are a simple one, aren&#39;t you. I will see that you receive some sort of reward.</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong> Hmm, what should it be... No doubt you are tired of chocolate by now...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...These gardens will take considerable effort to complete. I am certainly not going to build them myself.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Why did I go to such effort? Did I truly wish to win so badly?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> There are fragments with but the barest hint of memories throughout these gardens.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Destruction... Victory... Loss... Encounters... Prayers... And...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...No, I should not dwell on it. It would accomplish nothing except to make me feel bad.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> These memories are mine, and yet not mine. I must not overstep my bounds.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I would be doing a great disservice to myself if I did.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I turn the rock\u2013the memories I picked up over in my hand, and sigh.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Did I cast these memories away? Or did I once hold dearly to them?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Only the doves can say for sure.</p>',244),a=[n];function i(h,p){return t(),o("div",null,a)}var m=e(r,[["render",i],["__file","Semiramis.html.vue"]]);export{m as default};
