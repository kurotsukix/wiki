If you heed the Grail&#39;s call, and obey my will and reason, then answer me.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> I hereby swear. That I shall defeat all evil in the world.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> But let thine eyes be clouded with the fog of turmoil and chaos. Thou art trapped in a cage of madness, and I the summoner who holds thy chains\u2013</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> Seventh Heaven clad in the great words of power! Come forth from the circle of binding, Guardian of the Scales\u2014!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong> Ah!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> \u2013Thank you for coming, my fellow Servants. I am your Master.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> You know why you were summoned, yes? Destruction and slaughter, those are your orders.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> If a city is reveling in spring, destroy it. If a town is celebrating spring, devastate it.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> No matter how evil or cruel, God will forgive your every transgression.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> Should He mete out punishment,that is fine in its own way.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> For this is no more than a means of proving God&#39;s existence and His love.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> \u2013Now, then, Gilles. Please bring him here.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> As you wish.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> I trust you have not harmed him, Gilles?</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> No, of course not. Have you considered what you wish done with him?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> \u2014</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> Oh, my. Do you require suggestions from me?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> Oh, you have noticed my distress in your infinite concern for me?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> \u2014Don&#39;t be absurd. If you continue this foolishness, I&#39;ll kill you, Gilles.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> When you are eating a meal, do you think about how you use your fork?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> This is the same. What I do with him is a matter so trivial it does not merit any thought.</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong> ...Wh-What&#39;s going on? Where am I, and who are you people?</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong> Answer me! Are you deaf? You there\u2014Eep!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> Oh, Pierre! Bishop Pierre Cauchon! How I have missed you!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> A day has not gone by when your face has not crossed the mind of Jeanne d&#39;Arc!</p><p><strong>Pierre Cauchon:</strong> It can&#39;t be. It can&#39;t be, it can&#39;t be, it can&#39;t be, it can&#39;t be!</p><p><strong>Pierre Cauchon:</strong> Y-Y-Y-You&#39;re\u2013Jeanne d&#39;Arc?! Impossible! This can&#39;t be possible!</p><p><strong>Pierre Cauchon:</strong> I thought you died three days ago! I thought I killed you! I thought\u2013</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> &quot;That you should be in Hell? &quot;Perhaps I am, Your Grace.</p><p><strong>Pierre Cauchon:</strong> This is a dream. A nightmare. What else could it be but a nightmare!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> Oh dear, he&#39;s started to flee from reality. This won&#39;t do at all. We must snap him out of this.</p><p><strong>Pierre Cauchon:</strong> Aiiee! E-E-Eeeee!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> What will you do, Your Grace?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Jeanne d&#39;Arc, whom you accused of heresy, stands here before you.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Should you not grip your crucifix and offer up a prayer to God?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Should you not mock me? Scorn me? Abuse me? Trample me? And tell everyone the wicked Jeanne d&#39;Arc is here!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Should you not roar like the brave lion you are?! Go on, do it! Do it! Do it!</p><p><strong>Pierre Cauchon:</strong> Spa\u2013</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Spa?</p><p><strong>Pierre Cauchon:</strong> S-Spare me. Please spare me.</p><p><strong>Pierre Cauchon:</strong> I&#39;ll do anything. Spare me, I beg of you!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> \u2014Ha ha ha ha ha! Did you hear that, Gilles?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> &quot;Spare me, spare me,&quot; he says! This bishop who tied me up, mocked me, and burned me alive!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> As if that were nothing!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> The bishop who told me with kind eyes, that I was going to be killed. Is now begging for his life!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Oh\u2014The sadness is making me want to cry. After all, that won&#39;t save anything.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Your paper-thin faith won&#39;t reach the Heavenly Father. Belief that is light as a feather won&#39;t blossom anywhere.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Someone who has forsaken God, and clings to his life by begging a witch, is unfit to be called a believer.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Do you understand, Your Grace? You just gave testimony that you are now one of the heretics.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> That is why I&#39;m so sad. I think I might laugh until madness consumes me.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Now, think back, Your Grace. You know what sentence awaits heretics, don&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Pierre Cauchon:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Pierre Cauchon:</strong> N-No, no, no! Spare me...Please, spare me!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> I&#39;m so sorry, I&#39;m afraid I ran out of salvation today. Indulgences are not for sale in this era.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Now\u2014Shall we start at your feet? If I was burned alive by holy flames...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...Then your body shall be scorched by the flames of Hell.</p><p><strong>Pierre Cauchon:</strong> Aaaaaiiiiieeeee\u2013!!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...Not even the ashes remain, I see. I apologize for taking up your time, Gilles.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> What do you mean? That was a meaningful punishment. Now what should we do with the other clergy.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Good question, it&#39;s too much to question them all. Just feed the clergy to them.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Rejoice, my ignoble Servants! The surviving clergy are yours.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> I, your Master, Jeanne d&#39;Arc shall forgive you all.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Devour their souls. Feast on their flesh.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Savor their blood. After all, our manifestation is no different than that devil, Dracul.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> I have but one order. Wipe out this country, this mistake that is France.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Overrun it, trample it, reap it. Let us begin with our dear Orleans.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> We shall return its fruitful land to a bare wasteland.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Age, gender, and religious beliefs are of no importance. Make sure you kill them equally.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> That is the only order I give you as your Master.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> To that end, I have given you all the attributes of a Berserker.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> You may be a saint, or a hero, but now you shall dance with your broken soul.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Berserk Saber.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Berserk Archer.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Berserk Lancer.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Berserk Rider.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Berserk Caster.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Berserk Assassin.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> And him, whom I summoned instead of Berserker, and myself.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> I shall pass down judgement as this world&#39;s Ruler. Humanity has no value, for it failed to prove its love for our Lord.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> \u2014They are guilty to a horrifying extent. Humanity is equally guilty, sinner and saint alike.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> So we shall kill them all. I will not tolerate a single one escaping.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> Oh...Oh! Such resolve! Such truth without a slightest doubt!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> Such is the saint of salvation! The saint who believes in our Lord, and saves our people!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> You have returned...My light has returned...You have truly been reborn, Jeanne!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> Then I too, shall rise again as your general! First, we need a symbol...Our army must have a flag!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> Jeanne, what shall we use as our emblem? A demon, perhaps? Or what about\u2014</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> In that case, let&#39;s make it a dragon. Be it coincidence or providence, this summoning has brought many with close ties to dragons.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> In the name of dragons, the symbol of catastrophe,we will burn this world to the ground.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Oh, I have one more order. Laugh. As if you are enjoying yourselves from &quot;the bottom of your heart. &quot;</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Heh heh heh. Ah ha ha\u2013Hahahahaha! Ahahahahahaha!!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Wonderful! This is wonderful, Gilles! I&#39;ve never enjoyed myself this much in my entire life!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> YesYes, I suppose it is. That is the way it should be.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> You were put on a pedestal, made a symbol,exploited, and cast aside by the people\u2014</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> That is why you are righteous. There is no one who could pass judgment over your heart of hearts!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou? Kyu, fou?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Good morning, Fou.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I think I just had a bad dream...</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Mew, fou! Kyau, kyau!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Good morning, Senpai. It&#39;s finally time for the briefi\u2014Eek!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Kyuuuuu...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m sorry, Fou, I couldn&#39;t get out of the way. Still, I&#39;m glad to see you so full of energy in the morning.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You too, Senpai. Did you sleep well last night?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Like a log.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m glad to hear it. They say it takes talent to get a good night&#39;s sleep.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I know you just woke up, but it&#39;s briefing time. We should hurry.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I didn&#39;t get much sleep...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Oh, I forgot you sleep better on the floor or a tatami mat instead of a bed. That was my mistake, I&#39;ll make arrangements.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Still, the Doctor&#39;s briefing is about to start. Let&#39;s try to power through the sleepiness.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Good morning, Fujimaru. Did you sleep well?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Let&#39;s get right to the briefing, then.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> For starters...Oh right,let me go over what I want you to do again.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> First, the investigation and correction of the singularities. It is humanity&#39;s critical turning point in that era.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> If it were not for that, we could never have come as far as we have. It is the pivotal &quot;event&quot; in human history.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> You must travel to that era, investigate what it is,figure it out, and then correct it.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Otherwise, 2019 will never come. Humanity will be extinct in 2018.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> That is your first objective. The basic principle of the upcoming operation.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The operation&#39;s second objective is Investigate the &quot;Holy Grail. &quot;</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> This is just my speculation, but the singularities must be related to the Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The &quot;Holy Grail&quot; is a relic that can grant wishes. A vessel that contains tremendous amounts of magical energy.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Lev probably got his hands on the Grail in some form, and misused its power.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Rather, it&#39;s impossible to travel through time and change the past without the Grail. Seriously.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> You will run into intel regarding the Grail during your investigation of the singularity.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Even if you correct history, leaving the Grail will put us back to square one.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> You must either secure the Holy Grail, or destroy it.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Those are the two objectives of this operation. Is everything clear so far?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Crystal clear.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Glad to hear it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Sorry, could you go over it again?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> All right, fine. But pay attention this time, okay?</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...And now, there&#39;s one other thing I want you to do in addition to the mission.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> That said, it&#39;s nothing major. It&#39;s for after you Rayshift to that era.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I want you to find a leyline and make a summoning circle. Just like you did in Fuyuki.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Unlike Fuyuki, we could probably make do as-is if it&#39;s just telepathic communication...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> But to transport supplies, it won&#39;t work without establishing a summoning circle.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Just like before, once Mash sets up her Noble Phantasm it will act as a catalyst and trigger the summoning circle.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Once you do that, you can summon Servants at will.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Of course, what you summon will probably be Servants closely tied to that time and place.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> So keep doing that to bolster your forces. Understood?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Understood. Before all else, we&#39;ll try to establish a base camp first.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What we&#39;ll need is a place to relax, a structure with a roof, a home to come back to. Right, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yes, I&#39;ll be counting on you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Right. You have a way with words, Mash.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> H-Hearing you say that, really means a lot to me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I know I&#39;m still an inexperienced Servant,but you can count on me. I&#39;ll be giving it my all!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Kyuu!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Umhm. To see Mash, who&#39;s serious, quiet, and frankly,kind of mysterious, grow up to be such a fine lady...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hey, get over yourself. How long are you gonna keep me waiting?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Oops, you&#39;re right. You didn&#39;t show any interest so I forgot you were there.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Allow me to introduce you, Fujimaru. He...no, she...er, it? Um, who?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Sheesh. Standing there is Chaldea&#39;s pride and joy,the head of our Engineering Department, Leonardo.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> As you can tell, they are quite unusual. Of course, not a human...Let&#39;s not get into that.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The reason being\u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...A Servant. Senpai, this is incredible. This person is a Servant!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Right you are\uFF5E\u266A I&#39;m Chaldea&#39;s honorary tech advisor, I normally go by Leonard here.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But as you can see, I am the proud inventor of the Renaissance! The one-and-only Leonardo da Vinci in the flesh!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You can just call me Da Vinci. You don&#39;t get to see many pretty ladies like myself around here right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Huh? Pretty lady?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Da...Vinci?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This is strange. It&#39;s abnormal. It&#39;s wrong! I mean, Leonardo da Vinci should be a man\u2014</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You should always question conventional wisdom. But, is it really that important?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Who was the first one that claimed I was a man or a woman? Sheesh, for crying out loud.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I pursue beauty with both my inventions and art. It was I who personified all ideals\u2014all beauty.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> To me, the ideal beauty is the Mona Lisa. That being the case\u2014See? Isn&#39;t this simply an unavoidable result?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I like to think of myself as a scholar, but this guy&#39;s pet theories go way over my head.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> He&#39;s the only pervert twisted enough to turn himself into the Mona Lisa, just because he loves the Mona Lisa.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Heh heh. Are you sure about that, Dr. Roman?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> As cultures mature, anything is possible. The desire to become a beautiful girl might one day be the norm.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> That might be true, but which time period&#39;s Heroic Spirit are you?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Genius has nothing to do with time period, Doctor. Fujimaru, you&#39;d do well to remember that too.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You will encounter many Heroic Spirits who were artists. Every one of them is as splendid and eccentric!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Are you kidding me? Still, I can see that being the case!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I see. It&#39;s true that I didn&#39;t want to know too much,but thank you for the advice, Da Vinci.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That&#39;s my girl, you&#39;re always so understanding. Ok, that&#39;s enough for my introduction.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> From now, I will be focusing on supporting you with supplies, R&amp;D within Chaldea, and updated Heroic Spirits&#39; contracts.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I am a Servant summoned by Chaldea, you see. Unlike Mash, I cannot jump to any era.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> However, if Fujimaru has a contract with me, then it would be another matter.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I would then be able to aid you as an ordinary Servant. I&#39;m looking forward to such a fate, Master.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...Wow, he really did introduce himself and run off. Now, as I was saying before I was interrupted...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;m sorry but we don&#39;t have time to rest. We&#39;re going to prep for immediate Rayshift, ok?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Of course. I&#39;m ready to go at any time.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...Well, if I have to.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Fujimaru, we have a coffin ready for you this time. You should be able to Rayshift safely and quickly now.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Seven singularities have been detected, but we&#39;ve selected the time period with the smallest fluctuations.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Once you get there, we&#39;ll only be able to communicate with you.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Got it? I know I&#39;m repeating myself, but the first thing is to set up a base camp and finding a leyline.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> After you&#39;ve settled into the era, do what needs to be done. All right\u2014Good luck, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Announcement A:</strong> Unsummon Program start. Spiritron Conversion start.</p><p><strong>Announcement A:</strong> Rayshift starting in 3, 2, 1...</p><p><strong>Announcement A:</strong> All procedures cleared. Grand Order commencing operation.</p><h2 id="section-1-land-of-the-hundred-years-war" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-land-of-the-hundred-years-war" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 1: Land of the Hundred Years&#39; War</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Sigh. We managed to reach here safely, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We were teleported by accident last time. This time it&#39;s a proper teleport via the Coffin with no physical anomalies.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou! Fou! Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Fou? Did you tag along again?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou...kyuu, kyao...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Can Fou Rayshift too?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Did he sneak into Mash&#39;s Coffin?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Seems that way. He must have sneaked into mine or Senpai&#39;s Coffin.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Luckily, Fou was unharmed.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Since he is attached to one of us, when we return he will automatically return as well.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> In that case, no problem, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I need to get back safely for Fou&#39;s sake, too.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. We share the same fate.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> \u2013Master. I have confirmed the time axis coordinates. Looks like it&#39;s the year 1431.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It means we&#39;re in the middle of the Hundred Years&#39; War. But this should be during the war&#39;s respite period.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Respite?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Wars get time-offs?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Right, The Hundred Years&#39; War did not fight for the full 100 years as the name implies.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The war during this era was pretty carefree, relatively speaking.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Captured knights were released for monetary payments almost every day...Senpai?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Look at the sky.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What is...Huh?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Yes, we&#39;re connected! Not the best quality, but I&#39;ve got video feed now too!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Wait, what&#39;s wrong you two? Both of you staring at the sky like that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Doctor, I&#39;ll send you visuals. What is that?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> This is\u2013</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> A ring of light...No, some form of magecraft cast over the satellite orbit?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> In any case it&#39;s gigantic. At worst, it&#39;s as big as North America?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Hmmm, no records show such phenomena occurring in 1431.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It&#39;s surely one of the reasons for the disappearance of our future. We&#39;ll have to analyze it on our end...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> You guys concentrate on surveying onsite. Start by searching for leylines.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What the Doctor said.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Explore the area, make contact with the people of this era, set up the summoning circle, there are many things to do.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We have to knock them out one at a time. Let&#39;s first move towards a city, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai, stop. Confirming...Looks like a French scout brigade.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What do we do? Should we attempt to make contact?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Let&#39;s do that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Isn&#39;t it dangerous?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> They look like humanoids. I&#39;m sure we can come to a peaceful resolution.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Hello, excuse me. We are travelers\u2013</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou?</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> Eek! Enemy attack! Enemy attack!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Yoo-hoo, I&#39;m free now so lemme see how you&#39;re...Wait, why are you surrounded by an armed group?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I apologize. My mistake. I should&#39;ve greeted them in French.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Was that the problem!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> They know what you&#39;re saying to begin with?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Of course. But now, I believe that combat is unavoidable.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> You&#39;re starting with a fight? With French elites, even!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> W-Well, let&#39;s calm down first! That world is isolated.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> No matter what happens, a time paradox can&#39;t occur. So engaging them won&#39;t be a problem, but...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Doctor, give us an idea. Don&#39;t you know any French jokes for times like this?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Hell if I know, I&#39;m a loner! But wait, let me think...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I just need to think of a witty joke, right? Like &quot;knock, knock! &quot;</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> I&#39;m hearing a silly voice from somewhere...All hands, ready your weapons! They&#39;re too suspicious!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I apologize, Senpai. It was wrong of me to expect something from the Doctor.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I think it would be bad to harm the locals. We should attack to hold them back!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What are YOU talking about now, Mash?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You&#39;ve stooped as low as Roman!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> D-Did I say something wrong?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> In that case, hit them with the back of your blade!

Let&#39;s quietly chase them and ask what&#39;s going on.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Try not to aggravate them next time.

By witch&#39;s flames?</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> It&#39;s &quot;Jeanne d&#39;Arc. &quot;She has risen again as the &quot;Dragon Witch. &quot;</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> England retreated quite a while ago.

She is a world-renowned hero.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A woman who stood up to save France from being conquered in the late stages of Hundred Years&#39; War.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> She saved France at age 17, and managed to reclaim Orleans in just one year...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But she was caught by the English army,and after an inquisition, burned at the stake.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> They say that from the time of her imprisonment till her burning, she endured gruesome torture and humiliation daily.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> England wanted to prove that she was not a saint, but a heretic.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So they tried to torture her into saying&quot;I did not hear the Lord&#39;s voice. &quot;</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> \u2014However, her heart remained true. Even while burning, she held onto her prayers.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Later, her honor was recognized, and after 400 years she was officially made a saint.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A powerless girl&#39;s wishes changed the world\u2014In that regard, Jeanne d&#39;Arc is definitely a top-rank Heroic Spirit.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> Here!

I took part in the siege of Orleans and the ceremony, so I remember it well.</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> Her hair and skin color are different, but there&#39;s no question that she&#39;s the saint from the past.</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> Hearing that she&#39;d been captured by the English and burned at the stake, we trembled in fury.</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> But\u2013she was resurrected.

I found them in the Command Room next to the tea, so I thought...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I got them as a token of gratitude, for when we return from this Order.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Needless to say, they weren&#39;t for you, but for Senpai, who no doubt fought bravely on the frontlines.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Mash...you&#39;ve become such a thoughtful person...(gobble, gobble)</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I must say, these are some really tasty sweets.

My Individual Name is Mash Kyrielight.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This is Fujimaru. My Master.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Master? So there are Masters even in this Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No, it has nothing to do with the Holy Grail War. I am just a Demi-Servant.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Demi-Servant?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Not a true Heroic Spirit. Have you heard of us?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...Right. We should probably clear that up first.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I am indeed a Servant, my class is Ruler. I understand that.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> But...A majority of information about the Holy Grail War that should be provided is missing.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> No, not just information. My stats have ranked down as well.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Not only have I lost the anti-Servant Command Spells,I can&#39;t even reveal their True Names anymore.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Luckily this is my homeland where I was born and raised. If nothing else I still speak the language...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That soldier earlier was saying that Jeanne d&#39;Arc turned into a &quot;Dragon Witch&quot;.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...Having just materialized a few hours ago, I am not sure what&#39;s going on.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> It seems there is another Jeanne d&#39;Arc in this world.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> A Jeanne that murdered King Charles VII of France, and committed the slaughter at Orleans...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So does that mean two of the same Servants have been summoned in the same era?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Hmm...If we could access the Holy Grail War&#39;s records, there should be examples of simultaneous summons.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Anyway, one thing is for sure. Charles VII is dead, and Orleans has been occupied.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Which symbolizes the collapse of the nation of France.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> In history, France was the first nation to declare human liberty and equality. Many countries followed suit.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Delaying this by 100 years would stagnate civilization.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Without progress we might still be stuck in the Middle Ages.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I just heard a voice...Is that magecraft? What in the world are you all\u2014</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Oh that&#39;s right, we didn&#39;t introduce ourselves. Nice to meet you, Saint Jeanne d&#39;Arc.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> My name is Romani Archaman. Everyone calls me Roman.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I do various support tasks. Nice to meet you.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I see, Roman. You tend to be a dreamer!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...What is this sense of defeat? She complimented me, but I&#39;m not happy at all...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Excuse me, Mademoiselle Jeanne. It&#39;s our turn now.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Our objective is the correction of this twisted history. We belong to an organization by the name of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...I see, I understand now. To think that the world itself has been incinerated.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> My worries were so trivial. But now, I\u2014</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I&#39;m an incomplete Servant, and even I cannot trust &quot;myself. &quot;</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> The Jeanne &#39;d&#39;Arc that occupied Orleans...Not only that, but those flying dragons...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You mean the wyverns...There is no way wyverns existed in the 15th century France.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> More importantly, he called you a &quot;Dragon Witch&quot;.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Yes, I don&#39;t want to admit it, but the person controlling those dragons must be &quot;myself. &quot;</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I have no idea how she&#39;s controlling them. I never thought about such things during my life.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Summoning dragons is the highest form of magecraft, let alone to have this many\u2013</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It&#39;s an impossible feat for modern mages. It should be difficult even for this era&#39;s magecraft.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> That means...Fujimaru. If there&#39;s anything that could bend rules like this...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...It&#39;s likely to be a Holy Grail?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Exactly. It&#39;s only speculation, but these are no longer someone else&#39;s problems.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...Smooth over chunky?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> You&#39;re still bringing that up? You&#39;re pretty vindictive, aren&#39;t you?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I see, there are still many unclear points, but I have an idea now.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Mademoiselle Jeanne. What are you going to do from here?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...The objective is clear.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Head to Orleans, and take back the city. To do that, I must exterminate the Jeanne d&#39;Arc who stands in my way.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> The Lord didn&#39;t show me the path, but I cannot turn my back on this.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Even alone, you will fight...She&#39;s just like history says, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yeah, I thought so, too.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> A startling difference from Da Vinci.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master, and Doctor. Our objective and Ms. Jeanne&#39;s are the same.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I was thinking about our next course of action...How about we help her?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Of course, I thought the same.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;d help even without a mission.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Right. It&#39;s best to work together with Jeanne here. It&#39;s a rare honor to fight alongside a Saint and Savior!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Good. Then once again, Mademoiselle Jeanne.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We have our own objectives, but we want to be of aid to you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Will you allow us to fight under your flag as your companions from now on?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Oh...The pleasure will be all mine. I cannot possibly thank you enough.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...Thank you, Mash, Fujimaru. I thought I would be in this fight all alone.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Now at this place and time, we shall fight as one. So, Fujimaru, please give us your orders!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I&#39;m so ashamed that I said I&#39;d fight on my own earlier. Thanks to you two, I feel stronger than ever.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Even if I&#39;m up against myself, a witch, I have nothing to be afraid of now the two of you are with me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Being called a witch...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Are you all right?</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I am fine.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Needless to say, it saddens me that they&#39;d mistake me for that other Jeanne.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> But it can&#39;t be helped.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> In fact, it hasn&#39;t been more than a few days since I was burned at the stake...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> If a resurrected me caused a massacre in Orleans, then I can&#39;t blame them for being scared of me.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...I was afraid the British might be stirred up, but it would appear things are going smoothly.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> We should seek out the Jeanne who they call a witch and defeat her.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> But for now, we should scout around first. The goal is simple, but reaching it not so much.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> As expected, Jeanne d&#39;Arc is well-versed in the art of the war. Like she said, an assault on Orleans is ill-advised.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It&#39;s an unfamiliar land and we have yet to set up any bases. For now, take the initiative and gather intel on their defenses.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> As for the witch Jeanne\u2013Or shall we call her Dark Jeanne? I would like to find out what kind of Servant she is.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The rest is up to our forces. It would be good to have more allies.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Jeanne, is there a reading on any other Servants besides ourselves?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I&#39;m sorry, but as I am now, I am incapable of using my ability as a Ruler to detect other Servants.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Like other ordinary Servants, I cannot detect them unless I am within a certain distance.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Wait, what about the other Jeanne?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Rulers can detect Servants?</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I was careless. There is that possibility.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> The other me...No, Witch Jeanne...Urgh, it&#39;s too confusing, I will also refer to her as Dark Jeanne!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Anyway, if that Dark Jeanne is truly a Servant then her Class, like mine, is Ruler.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> If that is the case, she will immediately be able to detect our location. We must be prepared for battle at all times.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> If possible, I would like to minimize our activities in any nearby towns and villages\u2014</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> But without any lead on our hands, I doubt that&#39;s possible.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Let us head out early tomorrow morning. Fujimaru is human and should probably get some sleep...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;ll do that then.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Are you all right?</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Yes, I am fine.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> My abilities may have gone down in rank, but I still possess the basic abilities of a Servant.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Well, good night.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Did Fujimaru go to sleep?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, surprisingly quick for someone who is unfamiliar with sleeping outdoors.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Is that so...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I could be imagining things, but is there something you aren&#39;t telling us?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I don&#39;t mean to pry...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I thought it best to confront you in case it should become an obstacle in battle.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Quite right. As you wish, I shall tell you.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> It could be because my summoning was incomplete.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Or\u2013perhaps it&#39;s because my original self died just a few days ago.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> How can I put it? It feels as if I am a &quot;brand-new Servant. &quot;</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A rookie, you mean?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Yes. There is no future or past in the Throne of Heroes.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> But, I don&#39;t have the power to access the records there. Therefore, it is difficult for me to act as a Servant.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> It feels like going into battle for the first time all over again. And that bubbly-looking mage from before...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> He called me a saint and savior, but even with that expectation, I have no such power.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...So, the thing is. I fear that I will become a burden to you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Jeanne, if that&#39;s all then it&#39;s all right.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> What?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I mean, this also feels like my first battle. We are the same.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> As a Demi-Servant, I cannot fully harness my power as a Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> However, the Heroic Spirit inside of me said &quot;It&#39;s okay. &quot;</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> And Senpai\u2014Master, trusts someone like me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I don&#39;t know how to say this, but Senpai didn&#39;t choose to fight to prove something.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai is simply trying to do what should be done, I think.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So, it&#39;s all right. There&#39;s no reason for you to worry.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...Thank you. I feel a little better.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I am pretty familiar with this era and this country. Let&#39;s give it our best tomorrow!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes!</p><h2 id="section-4-information-gathering" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4-information-gathering" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 4: Information Gathering</h2><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> First, let&#39;s cut through this forest and head to Orleans.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Of course, it will be difficult to enter directly.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> But we might be able to get some information from the surrounding towns and forts.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> We&#39;re almost at La Charite.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> If we can&#39;t get any information here about Orleans, we&#39;ll have to get closer\u2013</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I&#39;d rather avoid that as much as possible.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> As long as I am still uncertain about the forces we have, we cannot engage.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;re really cautious.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You&#39;re really calm.</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...No, to be honest, I am panicking.

The saint devoted to France...the other &quot;me. &quot;</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> What? That&#39;s nonsense. You are no saint. Just as I am no saint.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> But, that is already a thing of the past. More importantly\u2014Why did you attack this town?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...Why, you ask? As the same Jeanne d&#39;Arc,I thought you would understand.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Are you stupid now that your alignment has changed? The reason I attacked this city?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> What a foolish question. It&#39;s obvious, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> It is for the sole purpose of destroying France. I am, after all, a Servant.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Politically, economically, these methods take too long. Is it not better to simply physically crush everything?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Such foolishness!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> &quot;Such foolishness? &quot;The foolish ones are us, Jeanne d&#39;Arc.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Why did you want to save this country? Why did you want to bring salvation to these people?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> All the while knowing that they are the ones who spit on and betrayed us!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> That is\u2013</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> I will be fooled no longer. I will be betrayed no longer. I no longer hear the voice of the Lord.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> The fact that I cannot hear His voice, means the Lord no longer blesses this country.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> So, I will destroy it, in accordance to the Lord&#39;s grief. I will cut away all the bad seeds at the roots.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> As long as the human race exists, so will my hatred. I will remake this France into a land of the dead.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> That&#39;s how I will save this country. By the hands of the new Jeanne d&#39;Arc, reborn through death.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> I suppose you could never understand. Always playing the saint.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Impossible for a pretty little holy virgin who pretends not to see hatred and joy and is incapable of human growth!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> No, what is human growth to Servants? If you&#39;re going to call it something, you would rank up as a Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> \u2014There appears to be a noisy fly here. Should I kill it if it&#39;s gets too annoying?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Wait, wha-, the console&#39;s on fire! That Servant can burn her enemies with just a glare!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...Are you really &quot;me&quot;?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...I have played my part for you so clearly, yet you still have doubts?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> This rage is an ugly justice. It&#39;s not that you cannot understand it, you do not even have the will to try.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> But, I understand. Seeing you, I have realized all there is to the Heroic Spirit that is myself.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> You are neither Ruler nor Jeanne d&#39;Arc. You are nothing but some leftover residue that I threw away.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> !!!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> If you were the same existence and Class as I, then I should have felt something.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> But you are worthless. Nothing but a ghost with a misguided effort to recreate history.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Berserk Lancer, Berserk Assassin. Finish off that country girl.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> You&#39;re getting tired of small prey, aren&#39;t you? Rejoice, they are strong.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Among all the Servants I summoned, your thirst for blood is the strongest.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> You exist to crush the brave. Devour them to your heart&#39;s content.</p><p><strong>Berserk Lancer:</strong> \u2014Very well. Now, I will have your blood.</p><p><strong>Berserk Assassin:</strong> Not so fast &quot;my King. &quot; I would like to partake of her flesh and blood, as well as her insides.</p><p><strong>Berserk Lancer:</strong> So greedy. And her soul? Who gets to take her soul?</p><p><strong>Berserk Assassin:</strong> There is no gain in taking her soul. Do you think honor or reputation can maintain my beauty?</p><p><strong>Berserk Lancer:</strong> Very well. Then I shall take her soul. It&#39;s quite ironic though.</p><p><strong>Berserk Lancer:</strong> I am able to understand her beauty, only after I have fallen as a blood-sucking devil.</p><p><strong>Berserk Assassin:</strong> Yes. That is precisely why I cannot hold back my emotions.</p><p><strong>Berserk Assassin:</strong> I will not forgive anything more beautiful than me. No, more than that\u2014</p><p><strong>Berserk Assassin:</strong> The blood of those more beautiful than me, can only elevate my beauty!</p><p><strong>Berserk Assassin:</strong> Ah, how fun it is to crush such fresh fruit. I&#39;ll throw away the skin and just enjoy the juice\u2014</p><p><strong>Berserk Assassin:</strong> This is the privilege of being a Noble of the Night. I&#39;ll squeeze every last drop out of you.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Ugh!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Let&#39;s do this.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> We have no other option.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Right!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Jeanne! Get ready, they&#39;re coming!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> U-Understood!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Berserk Assassin:</strong> I can&#39;t believe you couldn&#39;t finish off a young girl...I wonder if you felt sympathy for her.</p><p><strong>Berserk Assassin:</strong> Kindness doesn&#39;t suit you. It&#39;s not very monster-like, Dracul.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Dracul...no way.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Vlad III...Romania&#39;s greatest hero. Also known as the Lord Impaler.</p><p><strong>Berserk Lancer:</strong> Who knew that you&#39;d reveal my True Name in front of others. I&#39;m extremely displeased.</p><p><strong>Berserk Assassin:</strong> What&#39;s wrong? I would rather be remembered by a bad name than not at all.</p><p><strong>Berserk Assassin:</strong> Besides...I prefer to be called by my True Name. Dread and despair, faintly spiced with hope.</p><p><strong>Berserk Assassin:</strong> The ones with the best cries are the little squirrels who think &quot;I can escape. &quot;</p><p><strong>Berserk Lancer:</strong> But in the end, you were driven to ruin by the hands of those who actually escaped.</p><p><strong>Berserk Lancer:</strong> Elisabeth B\xE1thory. Otherwise known as Carmilla. How humorous your tragic end was.</p><p><strong>Berserk Assassin:</strong> How boring. That&#39;s why I don&#39;t like your kind. Even as you&#39;re damned as a vampire, you still cling to your noble &quot;heart. &quot;</p><p><strong>Berserk Lancer:</strong> \u2014You mean to say that I cling to my faith even now?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Stop this instant. I told you that you could devour freely,but do not forget who is friend and foe.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Turn your animosity to those little girls now. Save your petty squabbles for later.</p><p><strong>Berserk Assassin:</strong> Ah, you misunderstand, Master. Secretly, I idolize Count Vlad as a leader.</p><p><strong>Berserk Lancer:</strong> That&#39;s the first I&#39;ve heard of it. Comparing idolizing with plotting assassination.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Wow...They&#39;re fighting amongst themselves...It&#39;s a bad work environment, over there.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Do not let your guard down, Master. They still intend to kill us!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Berserk Assassin:</strong> All right, it&#39;s my turn. Please don&#39;t mistake me for that kind Count Vlad.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master...Elisabeth B\xE1thory.... Do you know her?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> The Blood Countess, was it?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s right. Like Vlad III, she was feared as a monster\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> She believed that bathing in the blood of virgins would keep her youthful. She&#39;s said to have murdered hundreds of girls.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Never heard of her.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> She was a Hungarian noble, who was said to have abducted and slaughtered young girls.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> She believed bathing in their blood would make her skin youthful again.</p><hr><p><strong>Berserk Assassin:</strong> Saints&#39; blood is valuable. No woman would let go of a gem placed before her!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Berserk Assassin:</strong> Something doesn&#39;t feel right. Was that the reason Count Vlad...</p><p><strong>Berserk Assassin:</strong> You over there, young lady. You\u2014smell horrible.</p><p><strong>Berserk Assassin:</strong> A girl of such tender years, yet so battle-hardened. How contradictory. Who is she?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...A Demi-Servant. An anomaly, a cross between a human and a Servant.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> !!!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...That was my mistake. You two are crueler than the others, but that&#39;s why you&#39;re so playful.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Let the remaining three deal with this girl.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Berserk Lancer:</strong> Wait, Carmilla and I can still fight. The saint&#39;s blood belongs to us.</p><p><strong>Berserk Lancer:</strong> As if I would allow mere executioners who know nothing of the radiance of blood, the grandeur of blood, take...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Shut up. Know your place, Vlad III.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> No matter how much authority you may have had in life, you&#39;re all equals as Servants.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> You wanted so badly to suck her blood that you unconsciously held back. You haven&#39;t learned a thing.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> \u2014I hate people like that. Stay out of it this time, okay?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Mash, run! I&#39;ll hold her off!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Oh no, is she sending those three after us now? What do we do? Any ideas? Any ideas?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Doctor, please calm down. You&#39;re starting to make me panic, too!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> B-But this is really bad, right! Okay, where&#39;s my email? I need the internet&#39;s help!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Off to the internet idol page! Help me Magi\u2606Mari! Help me Magi\u2606Mari!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> &quot;We&#39;re being attacked by three Servants. What should we do? &quot; Okay, sent.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> &quot;I guess you&#39;ll have to just die and be reborn! \u2606&quot;</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Wow, internet idols are HARSH! She doesn&#39;t know how I feel!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> \u2013Master, I&#39;m going to try and break through.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Stay close!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ugh!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> That should be enough. Just in case, I will make sure to remove your head from your body.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Both of you, please go!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> What?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> \u2013What?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A glass\u2013rose?</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> \u2013It&#39;s not elegant.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> Neither is this city. Neither is that combat style. I don&#39;t like your philosophy or principles either.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> You&#39;re so beautiful, yet you shroud yourself in blood and hatred.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> For good or for evil, shouldn&#39;t a human try to be more free?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...A Servant?</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> Yes, that&#39;s right. I&#39;m so happy. This is what it means to announce oneself as a hero of justice!</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> I know who you are. I also know how powerful and terrifying you are.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> To be honest, I have to confess that I&#39;ve never trembled in fear more before anyone else.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> Yet still\u2014If you intend to invade this nation, then I shall face you even if I have to tear apart my dress.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> Why? Because...</p><p><strong>Berserk Saber:</strong> You are...</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> Oh my. So you know my True Name. Have we met before, splendid female knight?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Saber. Who is she?</p><p><strong>Berserk Saber:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> \u2013Answer me.</p><p><strong>Berserk Saber:</strong> I can tell who she is, even with this murderous rage burning in my heart. Her beauty is unmistakable.</p><p><strong>Berserk Saber:</strong> The girl they called the Flower of Versailles. She is\u2014Marie Antoinette.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Queen Marie Antoinette?</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> That&#39;s right! Thank you for saying my name!</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> And as long as that name exists, I will play my role, no matter how foolish it may be.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> You! Dragon Witch who&#39;s torching my country. It might be pointless, but I will ask you anyway.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Are you evil enough to perform your wicked deeds in my very presence?</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Will you declare yourself a greater fool than I, the queen who failed to stop the revolution?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Silence! You lack the right to participate in this battle.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Oh, and why is that?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> You led a life of luxury in a palace, and died without even knowing what happened. Are you saying you can understand our hatred?</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Hmm...I suppose I can&#39;t. But that just makes me want to know more, Dragon Witch.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...What?</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> What I don&#39;t know, I learn. That&#39;s my policy.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> That&#39;s why I can&#39;t bear to look at you like this. Oh, Jeanne d&#39;Arc, beloved saint!</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> All I know is that you&#39;re taking your rage out on the innocent.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> And I&#39;ve not the slightest idea why. Everything&#39;s disappearing into a haze, like a girl going for a Sunday walk.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> I&#39;ve no words for you. What I do know is this.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Along with the Jeanne d&#39;Arc over there. I am going to make your heart and body mine!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Uh...huh?</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Oh, my. Oh dear, oh dear. Um, don&#39;t misunderstand me.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> I just meant that as a Queen, I&#39;m going to bring you to your knees.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...It&#39;s falling apart...My image of Marie Antoinette is falling apart...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> \u2014Enough of this farce. Very well then, you are my enemy.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Servants, first take care of that annoying princess! Then the others!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> We survived somehow. So did she!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Gasp...gasp...gasp...</p><p><strong>Berserk Lancer:</strong> Damn, so irritating!</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Yes, that&#39;s right. This is a battlefield, after all. That&#39;s enough talk.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> You&#39;re the enemy of the world, aren&#39;t you? So first\u2013We must appease the souls of all those you murdered.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Thank you for waiting, Amadeus. Crush them like bugs!</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Leave it to me! Noble Phantasm, &quot;Requiem for Death. &quot;</p><p><strong>Berserk Assassin:</strong> One more! Oh, but what a glorious, evil sound!</p><p><strong>Berserk Lancer:</strong> Ugh, such pressure!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Damn!</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Now then, good day everyone. Au revoir!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...Hmph. Rider!</p><p><strong>Berserk Rider:</strong> ...What is it?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Go after them. Surely you can catch them on your &quot;horse. &quot;</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> There&#39;s no need to fight.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Just tell me where they are, and I&#39;ll crush them.</p><p><strong>Berserk Rider:</strong> ...Understood. I assure you I&#39;ll catch them.</p><p><strong>Berserk Assassin:</strong> Ahh, that awful noise is gone...What a shame.</p><p><strong>Berserk Assassin:</strong> I wonder if I can make that Servant my pet. I&#39;d stick his head on a phonograph and have him scream all night.</p><p><strong>Berserk Lancer:</strong> ...Ruler. Do you think Rider alone is enough to handle them?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> It will be fine. Rider&#39;s Noble Phantasm is perfect for destroying them.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...But you&#39;re right, I should be careful. I&#39;ll return and prepare to summon additional Servants.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Go ahead and cause as much trouble as you like. If you&#39;re lucky enough to find them, slay them.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> You&#39;re not going to be beaten by an queen who never left her castle, are you?</p><p><strong>Berserk Assassin:</strong> How harsh. I stayed in a castle too.</p><p><strong>Berserk Assassin:</strong> But...Heh. My talents are a match for any of the others.</p><p><strong>Berserk Assassin:</strong> Saber, Lancer. The next time we fight, will you let me handle the enemy Rider?</p><p><strong>Berserk Lancer:</strong> May I ask why?</p><p><strong>Berserk Assassin:</strong> She is the person I wish to slaughter most in this world. It will be that woman Marie who kneels before me.</p><p><strong>Berserk Saber:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Berserk Assassin:</strong> Oh, Saber. Is there something you&#39;d like to add?</p><p><strong>Berserk Saber:</strong> You&#39;re right. There&#39;s no point in me worrying about your sense of inferiority towards her.</p><p><strong>Berserk Assassin:</strong> \u2013What did you say?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...Stop. I don&#39;t care. It doesn&#39;t matter who beats who, the result doesn&#39;t change.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> I leave this in your hands. Don&#39;t get too out of control.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Even Anti-Heroes have their dignity. Make sure you don&#39;t become mere murderers.</p><p><strong>Berserk Assassin:</strong> ...She flew off, huh? &quot;Dragon Witch&quot; is certainly the right word for her.</p><p><strong>Berserk Saber:</strong> \u2013The woman we just faced was the real Jeanne d&#39;Arc, wasn&#39;t she?</p><p><strong>Berserk Lancer:</strong> What of it? Ours isn&#39;t a fake either.</p><p><strong>Berserk Lancer:</strong> And we are Servants, in search of blood. \u2013Though you may not be, even in this state...</p><p><strong>Berserk Lancer:</strong> Chevalier d&#39;Eon. The noble dragoon.</p><p><strong>Berserk Saber:</strong> ...I will obey my Master. If she wishes to end the world, I will help her.</p><p><strong>Berserk Saber:</strong> And I too, am under Madness Enhancement. Do not anger me.</p><p><strong>Berserk Lancer:</strong> \u2013Heh. My apologies.</p><p><strong>Berserk Saber:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Berserk Assassin:</strong> It&#39;s hard not to feel pity. The Queen they respected, who sent them a dress, is now her enemy.</p><p><strong>Berserk Assassin:</strong> But that is the fate of a Servant. That is the nature of the Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Berserk Assassin:</strong> Lancer, let&#39;s go. We must search the next city.</p><p><strong>Berserk Assassin:</strong> We are vampires, who must drink the blood of the living. Finding our next meal is a matter of life and death.</p><p><strong>Berserk Lancer:</strong> ...Indeed, none of these meals are satisfactory. But I&#39;ll take what I can get.</p><h2 id="section-6-one-thing-after-another" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-6-one-thing-after-another" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 6: One Thing After Another</h2><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> \u2013Phew.

Jeanne? And...Marie?</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Marie, did you say?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> F-Forgive me. Um\u2013</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> You weren&#39;t being rude! You made me so happy!

How rude of me.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> So, how may I be of service?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A strong leyline was detected in a nearby forest. I&#39;d like to head there and make camp...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Is that all right, everyone?</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Of course, that&#39;s fine. Is that all right with you, Amadeus?</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> There&#39;s no point in asking for my opinion. Do what you want, Maria.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> All right.

Today I&#39;ll be talking about Servant categories.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Most of the Servants that can be summoned are divided into seven classes.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Saber, Archer, Lancer, Rider, Berserker, Caster, Assassin.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Each class has various compatibilities.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Saber has the advantage over Lancer, for instance. And Lancer over Archer, and Archer over Saber.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Rider over Caster, Caster over Assassin, and Assassin over Rider.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> And Berserker is strong against all classes, but weak when attacked.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It&#39;s like a game of rock, paper, scissors. Keep this in mind when fighting the enemy.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Of course, there are some Servants who don&#39;t fall into these categories.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I&#39;ll explain them another time. Okay, circle&#39;s good to go. Have a nice journey!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Now that things have settled down, I&#39;d like to introduce myself again.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> My True Name is Marie Antoinette. I&#39;m from the Rider Class.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> As for who I am, I&#39;d be happy if you could examine me closely with your eyes and ears.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> As for why I was summoned, unfortunately,I have no idea. After all, I have no Master.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. I&#39;m the same as her.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> As for why I was summoned, first of all, it just doesn&#39;t feel like I&#39;m a hero.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Yes I&#39;m great, but even so, I&#39;m still just one of many artists...</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Well, I did apply magecraft in my music, but that was only because I was drawn to the sounds played by demons.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m Mash Kyrielight. I&#39;m a Demi-Servant, and I don&#39;t know what my True Name is.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This is Fujimaru.

My homies!</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Hmph, it seems different when Fujimaru says it...Perhaps I need to think more like a peasant...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Come on...Don&#39;t teach her weird greetings.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Oh, I&#39;ve got it! I have to be more needy! Come on, Amadeus! Whassup!</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Whassup! I like it, Maria. Keep it up! I can feel the love of a century beginning to fade!</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> ...Hmmph.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> I&#39;m sorry Fujimaru. Whassup is a very stimulating greeting, but I must reluctantly refrain from it.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> If Amadeus likes it, that means it&#39;s not appropriate for a lady to use.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Let&#39;s not be slanderous here. You&#39;re acting like I&#39;m a pervert gentleman who loves dirty jokes.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Don&#39;t blame me. You&#39;re a child when it comes to everything but music.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> And this is\u2013</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Jeanne. Jeanne d&#39;Arc, yes?</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> The saint who saved France. One of the people I wished to meet in my life.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...I&#39;m, not a saint.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Yes, everyone knows that&#39;s how you saw yourself.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> But the way you lead your life was true, and we all know the results.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> That&#39;s why everyone will always remember and admire the name Jeanne d&#39;Arc, and the miracle of Orleans.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Of course, your life ended at the stake and resulted in that witch. It&#39;s just like Maria to only look at the good parts.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Am I wrong, Jeanne d&#39;Arc? Your life was a little out of tune.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Jeanne herself is the one who gets hurt when people call her a perfect saint.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Listen, Maria. You always say what you think others want to hear. Sometimes you need to scold or deny others.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> I-I don&#39;t need to hear that from you, Amadeus! You already tell me that every day!</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> T-This is what you want, right? You piano-brain! Piece of human garbage!</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> You&#39;re a pervert who can only get it up for musical scales! If you like music so much, you should turn into a piano!</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> ...I don&#39;t know if I should say this, but when you insult me like that, I feel something indescribable.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> But see? You can do it if you try! Give the same treatment to Jeanne.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Faster. Stronger. More violent! Tell her all of her flaws as you see them!</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Non, that&#39;s impossible Amadeus.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Human garbage like you has nothing but flaws. But Jeanne herself has none.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> \u2014Are you serious? I didn&#39;t know you had it that bad. You really did love Jeanne d&#39;Arc, didn&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> I would say &quot;worship&quot; rather than love. And a bit of guilt, as well.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> ...A tiny &quot;sorry&quot;, the size of a teaspoon. The natural guilt we foolish royals feel towards the Saint.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...Marie Antoinette. Your words honor me, but that&#39;s why I must confess.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> In life, I was no saint.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I held the flag high for what I believed in, and as a result, I stained my hands with blood.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...Of course, I don&#39;t regret that. Nor do I regret the Inquisition\u2013Or my own death.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> But I shed too much blood. I believed in the dreams of a little country girl, but\u2014</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> At the time, I never imagined how high the price of that dream was.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I never regretted it, but never did I feel fear.... And that is my greatest sin.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Only the outcome of my actions made me a saint. I do not think it&#39;s the right word for a country girl like me.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> ...I see. So you&#39;re not a saint, right?</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Then, may I call you Jeanne?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...Y-Yes. Of course. It feels like that would bring back old memories.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Wonderful. Call me Marie, then.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> If you&#39;re simply Jeanne, and not a saint, then I want to be Marie, and not a queen.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Please Jeanne, will you call me Marie?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Y-Yes. All right...Thank you, Marie.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Thank you too. I am happy, Jeanne!</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> And I&#39;m sorry. I keep pushing my own views on you. You&#39;ve lost your own answers about yourself, haven&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Just like the day I died, not knowing a thing about what was going on. You&#39;ll have to find your own answers.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> I certainly want to treat you as a saint, but I&#39;ll stop myself!</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> I won&#39;t just believe in you, I&#39;ll support you! Isn&#39;t that what female friends are supposed to do, Amadeus?</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> I suppose so, yeah? You guys can go eat sweets or something.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We believe in you too. Right, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Of course.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...Heh, heh, thank you. That makes me feel better.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Fake monsters are a common thing.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> F-Fake monsters?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master...Don&#39;t say things that are going to confuse her.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> I don&#39;t know about fake monsters, but I do know about monsters!</p><hr><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Look, it seems like we have invited some unwanted guests.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> No, I don&#39;t think you invited them. Well, whatever. Let&#39;s get rid of them and resume our conversation!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> \u2013Now I understand. The whole world, never mind France, is in danger.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Although it&#39;s in a different form, this too, is a Holy Grail War?</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> I knew it was dangerous when I learned it was a Master-less summoning, but I didn&#39;t expect this.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Now there were five Servants in opposition. Nine total including Mash, but isn&#39;t that too much?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The rule of seven Servants is no more.... Although that doesn&#39;t mean infinite.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s not surprising at all if there are more than seven Servants.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...According to the records, one time a total of fifteen Servants fought.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Oh, I get it! I&#39;ve figured it out, everyone!</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> We were summoned so that\u2013We could defeat them, like heroes!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It might be to destroy the world.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Non, non, non! That&#39;s not right, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> I love everybody. Just as I did when I was alive.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> I wouldn&#39;t need these feelings to destroy the world, and they wouldn&#39;t summon me anyway!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I think you&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Yes, yes! I finally feel like I&#39;ve found my job in life!</p><hr><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> It&#39;s perfectly fine to be confident, Maria. But we&#39;re up against powerful foes.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Jeanne and Mash, as well as Fujimaru, are used to combat. But you and I aren&#39;t the fighting type.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> The numbers matter less than the fact that they&#39;re far stronger.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Indeed. Vlad III, and Elisabeth B\xE1thory.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> One carved their name into history as a hero, and the other, a murderess...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The other that looked like a Saber seemed to know Marie...</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> ...That&#39;s right. If she knows who I am, then...</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Perhaps she&#39;s Chevalier d&#39;Eon? I&#39;ve no proof, though.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Chevalier d&#39;Eon...A spy with Louis XV&#39;s intelligence agency, the Secret du Roi.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> She was also a Dragoon, and a plenipotentiary minister...She, no, maybe he?</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> It matters little, mage from a distant world.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> She was summoned from a different time than me, but her splendid face hasn&#39;t changed.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I see...It would be wonderful if she would join us...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> That might be difficult, I think.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I&#39;ve lost my Ruler&#39;s ability to see True Names, but there is one thing I could see.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> All of them have been given &quot;Madness Enhancement,&quot; regardless of their alignment or background.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Kyuu...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It&#39;s probably the power of the Grail. Even without an episode of madness, it can give them Berserker traits...</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Hmph. The goal of a Holy Grail War is to get the Grail, but they already have it.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> It&#39;s not fair!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> But that leaves one mystery. Why were you summoned?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...This is just a theory.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Despite the fact that the Holy Grail War hasn&#39;t begun, someone already has the Grail.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> This is a reversal of causality. A bug, if you will,and perhaps the Grail is resisting it.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> The greater the opponent, the more powerful the Grail&#39;s reaction.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I see. In other words, somewhere else in France\u2013</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Indeed. There may be other Servants summoned here like Marie.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Oh my! That means I can meet even more people, right?</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> That&#39;s not necessarily a good thing. It may just mean more enemies.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> But whichever it is, we should start searching for them as soon as we can.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Before the other Jeanne finds them.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Indeed. I&#39;ve lost my ability to detect Servants.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> So we&#39;ll have to depend on Mr. Roman.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Sure thing. I can&#39;t match a full-powered Ruler,but I can search farther than a Servant.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Let&#39;s take a little break first! You&#39;re all tired, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes Master, rest for a bit. We&#39;ll stand watch.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m going to patrol the area. Jeanne, please wait here.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, Fou!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Is something wrong, Jeanne? You seem defeated...Are you tired?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Marie...No, I&#39;m not tired. I am a Servant, after all.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Perhaps you&#39;re saddened by the state France is in...I mean, are you disappointed?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> No, I&#39;m not disappointed. Thank you for your concern, Marie.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> But...Seeing those familiar towns in flames is a bit hard to bear.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Yes...For you, especially, this era is exactly like it was when you were alive.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> It&#39;s different than what I feel inside...Memories that are still going on.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Yes! Why don&#39;t we take this time to talk? Girls&#39; night out!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...Excuse me?</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Oh, is that strange? But both you and I were summoned in the bloom of our youth.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> You see? I&#39;m in the middle of puberty, right? So I love talking about love and romance!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Ahaha...I appreciate the offer, but that&#39;s hard for me. I know of compassion, but not romance.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> But...You&#39;re missing out on life! It&#39;s not too late to start! Fall in love with someone, Jeanne!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Of course, if I get the chance. Have you fallen in love, Marie?</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Heheh, of course.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> I fell in love with a boy who proposed to me at age 7. I think it was my first love.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> And when I was 14, I fell in love with the king I married.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> 14! That&#39;s kind of amazing.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> When I was that age...I was working and playing in the fields with the other children.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> That sounds fun, too! I&#39;m jealous. It must be such fun to be able to go wherever you want!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Yes, it was fun. What I lacked in romance, I made up for in friendship.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Did all the boys like you?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Hmm, my hair was short then, so they treated me like one of the guys\u2013</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Oh, I&#39;m so glad I became a Servant! I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m having girl talk with Jeanne d&#39;Arc.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> It&#39;s good to be a queen!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> The honor is mine. Who would&#39;ve thought that I get to talk to the famous Marie Antoinette.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> It&#39;s good to be a Servant.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> I&#39;m just glad that this isn&#39;t a real Holy Grail War. Otherwise, we couldn&#39;t chat like this\u2013</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...Marie.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m sorry, both of you. It appears to be an enemy attack!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I knew it.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Oh my.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;ll go wake up Master!</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Come Jeanne, let us fight like proper Servants.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Bravely, gallantly, whole-heartedly, and yet beautifully, like a maiden in love.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> That&#39;s what you and I are at our core. Neither saints, nor queens.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...The way I fight has little to do with beauty and elegance, I&#39;m afraid.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master, your orders!</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Come, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> I&#39;ll show you the power that I couldn&#39;t show you before!</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> \u2014Tomboy princess, coming through! I&#39;ll dance brilliantly, like glasswork!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Servants detected! Also, multiple life-forms detected!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Prepare for battle!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes!</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> What a drag. I&#39;ve detected it, too. Having good hearing isn&#39;t always a good thing.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> In fact, I hate this sound so much it makes me want to scream.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> The sound of an enemy&#39;s footstep, is worse than a high-pitched trumpet.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You can hear them at this distance?</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Of course. I became a Servant because of my music. I can detect any sound wave in the air.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> For instance, the sound of you and Maria&#39;s sleeping when we were camping. I enjoyed listening to them both.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> But, not just the sound of you sleeping. I&#39;ve recorded all the tiny sounds your body makes in my Wolfgang Recorder!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> !!! A-A sexually harassing Servant!</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> I&#39;m sorry, Mash. As his keeper, I apologize.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> But bear with him a little. Without his ears, he&#39;s nothing more than a pervert!</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> What are you saying? Human beings create filth just by living!</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Only by realizing that can you create true music. Life is filth, and music cleanses it.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> \u2014Now then, I hear footsteps, and drawn swords.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Naught but boorish noise. I don&#39;t write my music for fools, but\u2013</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> You&#39;ve come all this way. I shall play my Requiem of Death for you!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> All that&#39;s left are the Servants!</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Is everybody all right? Does anyone need healing?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> We&#39;re good here. What about you, Mash?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m fine. Doctor, are they here yet?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> \u2013They&#39;re coming. Are you ready?</p><p><strong>Berserk Rider:</strong> ...Hello, everybody. What a lonely night.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> \u2013Who are you?</p><p><strong>Berserk Rider:</strong> Who? Let&#39;s see, I wonder who I am.</p><p><strong>Berserk Rider:</strong> I forced myself to be a righteous saint, but in this world I&#39;m a slave to a broken one.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> A broken saint...</p><p><strong>Berserk Rider:</strong> Yes, thanks to her, my reason has left and I&#39;ve gone mad.</p><p><strong>Berserk Rider:</strong> I am doing everything I can to hold myself back. What a mess this is.</p><p><strong>Berserk Rider:</strong> So while I appreciate your hopes, I cannot join you.</p><p><strong>Berserk Rider:</strong> You don&#39;t want a Servant who&#39;ll stab you from behind at every single opportunity, do you?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Then why did you come here?</p><p><strong>Berserk Rider:</strong> ...My task was to observe you, but my waning reason whispers that I should test you.</p><p><strong>Berserk Rider:</strong> You face the Dragon Witch. Disaster incarnate, riding on the &quot;ultimate dragon. &quot;</p><p><strong>Berserk Rider:</strong> If you cannot surpass me, you will never defeat her.</p><p><strong>Berserk Rider:</strong> Defeat me. Plunge your blade into my heart without hesitation.</p><p><strong>Berserk Rider:</strong> My True Name is Martha. Now come to me, Iron Dragon Tarasque!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Martha...Saint Martha? Watch out, everyone!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> She once defeated a dragon with nothing but prayers! If she&#39;s a Servant, that means\u2013</p><p><strong>Berserk Rider:</strong> Let us see if you are capable of slaying me\u2013!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> She&#39;s a dragon rider!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Berserk Rider:</strong> ...I see. That&#39;s enough.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Martha. Did you\u2013</p><p><strong>Berserk Rider:</strong> Hold back? Of course not.</p><p><strong>Berserk Rider:</strong> This is fine, it&#39;s fine this way. Seriously, don&#39;t make a saint massacre you!</p><p><strong>Berserk Rider:</strong> ...Listen, let me tell you one last thing. You&#39;ll never beat the dragon controlled by the Dragon Witch.</p><p><strong>Berserk Rider:</strong> There&#39;s only one way to surpass that type of dragon. Go to Lyon...the city once known as Lyon.</p><p><strong>Berserk Rider:</strong> It won&#39;t be a saint who defeats the dragon, nor a princess. Ever since ancient times, only a &quot;Dragon Slayer&quot; is capable of killing a dragon.</p><p><strong>Berserk Rider:</strong> Tarasque, I&#39;m sorry.... Next time, I hope I&#39;ll be summoned properly.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...Even Saint Martha can&#39;t resist her.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> She&#39;d undergone Madness Enhancement, in addition to being summoned. Perhaps it can&#39;t be helped.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Normally it would be impossible to even talk to her.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The only reason we were able to communicate was because of her incredible self-control.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Yes. She was a peaceful, yet fierce as a person. I could tell.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> She is the Iron Saint. She is a woman like adamantite,who solves things with her fists in the end.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> They say she defeated the Tarasque with a sermon, but I bet she just beat it up.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Anyway, thanks to her, we know where we&#39;re going.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> We should hurry, right? Let&#39;s get going to Lyon.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I&#39;m surprised. Amadeus seemed like, um, the type of person who&#39;d hate to travel on foot...</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Oh no, Amadeus loves traveling. He&#39;s traveled to many places ever since he was a child.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> ...Well, I suppose it&#39;s true that I&#39;m used to traveling.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Hehe, I&#39;m getting excited. I wonder what, and who, waits for us in Lyon!</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Come on, Jeanne. Let&#39;s get going.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...Right!</p><h2 id="section-7-search-for-the-dragon-slayer" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-7-search-for-the-dragon-slayer" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 7: Search for the Dragon Slayer</h2><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Did Rider commit suicide? It&#39;s troublesome that she retained her sanity even with Madness Enhancement.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Still, she likely fought with all of her might. If that&#39;s the case, we can&#39;t let our guard down.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Next time, &quot;he&quot; and I will mobilize. I&#39;m also taking the Servants summoned today.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Please contact the Berserk Assassin.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> Understood.

You don&#39;t even need luck!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> Please trample over them as much as you wish.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Gilles. Which do you think is the real one? Me, or her?</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> Of course it&#39;s you. Are you listening, Jeanne?</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> You were burned at the stake. Betrayed, by everyone!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> Charles VII left you to die, because he didn&#39;t want to pay the ransom!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> Not a single person rose to bravely fight for your return!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> And what was the cause of all this? It was God! It was our God, mocking us!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> Thus, we deny God. Don&#39;t we, Jeanne?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...Yes. Yes you&#39;re right, Gilles. I have nothing left.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> My soldiers are gone, and my admirers fled. The king betrayed me and the bishop burnt me in the name of God.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> \u2014I was wrong. No, everything was wrong.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Not just what I believed in. The very country that allowed me to exist was wrong.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> This mistake must be righted. Jeanne d&#39;Arc was a mistake.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> So let us do as they decided, and make it all so it never happened.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> My salvation of the country was itself a fatal mistake.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> ...Jeanne. Please, don&#39;t put yourself under such stress.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> This is a divine punishment. Nothing more. Your revenge is righteous. What you saved, you may destroy.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> Isn&#39;t that all there is to it?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...You&#39;re right, Gilles. What you say is extreme, but it brings me strength.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Let&#39;s go, Berserker, Assassin...This is getting complicated. May I use your True Names?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Lancelot, Knight of the Lake; and the Executioner, Charles-Henri Sanson.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Mount your wyverns. I shall lead you.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong> \u2014Urrrrrr.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> ...Of course, Master. Only I am fit to take the head of the Queen.</p><p><strong>Citizen:</strong> ...And that&#39;s what happened...</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> I see, I see! Understood. How interesting. How very interesting!</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Thank you, kind sir. Farewell, until we meet again!</p><p><strong>Citizen:</strong> Y-Yes ma&#39;am! Um, by the way, you seem to be of noble birth. What is your name\u2013</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> My name is Marie Antoinette! Hehe, it might be worth remembering.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> ...Keep passing it down for 360 years or so, and someone might be in for a surprise, hehe.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Guys! I got the information!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Sorry, Marie. I will cause a panic if I go into town...</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Don&#39;t worry, Jeanne. We&#39;re both Servants, you know.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Now, I&#39;ve got some great information. The city St. Martha told us of, Lyon.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> To put it simply, Lyon was destroyed a little while ago. Its refugees have settled here.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> The &quot;used to be&quot; nuance interests me.... So it&#39;s just as I thought?</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Yes. The town is filled with monsters that seem to have risen from the depths of Hell.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> But I think what came before that is the important part. They said Lyon had a protector.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A protector?</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> A knight with a large sword, who defeated wyverns and skeletons.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I see. Perhaps that&#39;s the Servant Martha spoke of before.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Yes. But a little while ago, some scary people came.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Servants, probably. He was overwhelmed by their numbers and is now missing.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> And so Lyon was destroyed...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I hope he&#39;s alive...No, let&#39;s believe in the words of St. Martha.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Oh, right. Charles VII visited the village and General Gilles de Rais marshalled the routed soldiers, they said.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Gilles!</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> He&#39;s attempting to attack Lyon and take back the city.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m sure it would be...difficult to meet with him.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Why is that? Gilles de Rais is an admirer of Jeanne, right?</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> If Jeanne asks, he&#39;s sure to lend a helping hand?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...That&#39;s precisely the reason. He knows that I&#39;ve become the Dragon Witch.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> He wouldn&#39;t accept me like that.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> ...I see. I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s quite right.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> But I understand that you might not want to see him! You&#39;re a girl, after all.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Yes, I agree we don&#39;t need to see him! We&#39;re in a hurry, after all.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> I don&#39;t think normal soldiers can handle all those monsters in Lyon, anyway...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...You&#39;re quite right. Let&#39;s defeat them on our own.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> We can do it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> No problem.</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Fujimaru...You&#39;re right. This is nothing.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Yes, that&#39;s what it means to be a [\u2642 boy /\u2640 commander]! Here&#39;s your reward!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What?</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Well? Was it good?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Thank you!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai...You have a goofy grin on your face.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master, hang in there.... Jeez!</p><hr><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> She finally went and did it, huh? Sorry, just ignore that.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Maria has a bad habit of kissing everything. It caused chaos in the palace.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> There were actually factions formed of people she&#39;d kissed and people she hadn&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> No playwright would touch a story about a court that almost destroyed itself before the revolution.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master, come on. Snap out of it. Snap out of it!</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Huh? You guys don&#39;t do kisses?</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Maybe like when your heart feels like someone&#39;s squeezing it...You do it too, right Jeanne?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I-I do not! I do not! Only with someone I was going to marry\u2014</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> ...Huh? Hey, hold on a second.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Those soldiers over there seem ready to kill. I don&#39;t think they&#39;re back from the front.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...Seems like they&#39;ve become bandits. This tragedy is enough to shatter anyone&#39;s mind.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> We cannot let the townspeople suffer. Let us capture them.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Got it. Back of the blade it is!</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> ...But that&#39;s a shield right?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We&#39;ve tied up the bandits, let&#39;s hand them to the town&#39;s people. I think we can leave the rest to them.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> All right, let&#39;s head out everybody!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> We&#39;re almost there, don&#39;t you think?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Yes, we should be.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...The thought of having to see a ruined town again, is heartbreaking.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...There&#39;s no one here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Doctor, any signs of life\u2013</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Doctor?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m sorry. Reception&#39;s not very good here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Let&#39;s split up and search for that &quot;Dragon Slayer&quot; Martha mentioned.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Right. Let&#39;s see which of us finds that person first. Amadeus and I will take the west side.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Then Mash and I will take the east.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Understood. Let&#39;s go, Master!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> This was once a beautiful town. Why would that Dragon Witch do this\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s a fake.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That&#39;s not you.</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> That&#39;d be nice, but...Huh? Did I just hear a voice?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, faintly. It may be a survivor. Let&#39;s go check it out.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...Ugh!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Living Dead!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Turning the townsfolk into monsters...This is beyond heresy!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We can&#39;t save them anymore...Ready for battle, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Rest in peace.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Be at peace.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Even more enemies!</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Yes, just as I thought! I hurried back, but they&#39;re swarming over here too!</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> You may not need any help, but I can&#39;t just sit around!</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> I will help you, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Wyvern!</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> What? I am tired of seeing them. They are no more than third-rate instruments, time to get rid of them!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Phew! Enemies eliminated. May their souls rest in peace\u2013</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A???:</strong> Peace...Do they desire peace? That is such a foolish thing to say.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A???:</strong> They have no peace in their souls. There is certainly none residing in us Servants\u2013</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A???:</strong> This world has been frozen for years...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Servant!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> \u2013Who are you?</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong> Correct. People call me\u2013The Phantom of the Opera.</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong> By order of the &quot;Dragon Witch,&quot;this town is under my absolute control.</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong> Now, now, now. This is the middle of Hell, where the dead live.</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong> \u2013What are you going to do?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> We&#39;ll send you flying.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> We&#39;ll crush you.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Just like that, Master! Here we go!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong> Ugh! Still, my mission is accomplished. Though I shall never be rewarded, never.</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong> This is where my song ends, but the real Hell starts now.</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong> Rejoice, oh Holy Maiden! Your evil has grown even more than you.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> \u2013Be silent. It must be hard to even talk now.</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong> These are not words. This is a song. To lament your future, and to mourn it.</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong> Forget about the Dragon Slayer...Run to the ends of the earth.</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong> If lady luck is on your side\u2013you might just have a chance to escape.</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong> Here it comes. The Dragon is here. The Devil is here. An evil dragon unlike any of you have seen before.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> You&#39;re a stubborn one, aren&#39;t you? The coda has ended, now back to hell with you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> An evil...dragon?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Finally, I got through to you! Everyone, I recommend that we evacuate!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> This reading is way beyond a Servant\u2013It&#39;s indicating an &quot;ultra-size lifeform. &quot;</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It&#39;s approaching with incredible speed!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Beyond a Servant! Can such a lifeform even exist in this world?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Of course they can! The world&#39;s a big place!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Um, sorry. Save the chatter for later! I am also detecting 3 Servants heading this way.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> ...It must be them. This is quite a problem.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> The orchestra is done. Let&#39;s get out of here. I know we just wasted our effort, but that&#39;s life.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But...Wait, please.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> If the reading is truly beyond that of a Servant, then we need the &quot;Dragon Slayer&quot; more than ever.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That person must be in this town, right? We can at least look for that Servant\u2013</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> No, no, no. No time, no time!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> But if we abandon that Servant now, we may never get another chance!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master, your orders!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Find the &quot;Dragon Slayer&quot;.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> If we run here, things will get worse. Let&#39;s fight!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Understood!</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Amadeus, let&#39;s prepare for battle.... Will you fight with me?</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Didn&#39;t you just order me to fight? You just need to stand proudly, and smile as always.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Don&#39;t worry yourself over me. If things get bad, I&#39;ll run away on my own!</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Yes. That&#39;s the Amadeus I know. It&#39;s okay, we just have to buy some time.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> I won&#39;t die. Not here, at least.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Doctor! Are you detecting any other Servants?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Searching now. Hang on a moment!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> \u2013Right.

I&#39;ve never forgotten your face, you lazy artisan.</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong> That&#39;s good to hear. I&#39;ve never forgotten yours either. Your face, and your pale white neck.</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong> At the same time, I feel like this is destiny. That you and I share a special connection.</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong> Don&#39;t we? The fate of a executioner killing the same person twice, I feel like only we share that kind of connection.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> ...Not only in life, but even now you&#39;re eager to execute Maria?</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Charles-Henri Sanson. Could it be that you are genuinely mad?</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> ...As a human, it pains me to discuss our relationship with a low-life like you.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> Amadeus, you claimed all lives, all humans, are filthy. Not I. Humans are sacred, precious things.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> That&#39;s why we executioners respect life. We are incompatible, you and I.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> Trash who couldn&#39;t even love humans, trash who couldn&#39;t understand her, has no right to be next to her.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A???:</strong> ...Arrrrrrrrrrr!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ugh!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What an attack! Master, please stand back!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This Berserker...He&#39;s much more frightening than any Servant we&#39;ve faced so far!</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Look at the sky! Look how many wyverns are in flight!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Ugh! I&#39;m going to help the French army! You two, take care of that Servant!</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> My sword of execution is pure.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> It&#39;s not for the likes of you who do not submit to death, but...</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> Thinking of it, this entire nation is an execution site. Now, I shall remove your head with one strike!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Arrrrrrrrrrrrr!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...Arrrrrrrrrr!</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> ...Damn.

Do you want to die?</p><p><strong>Commander:</strong> D-Don&#39;t run! That&#39;s the Dragon Witch over there!</p><p><strong>Commander:</strong> Take her down! Avenge your hometown!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Ugh!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Berserk Assassin:</strong> Wyvern. Start off by eating the soldier!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Aaaaarrrghhhhhhhh!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> (pant, pant, pant)...</p><p><strong>C\uFF1ASoldier:</strong> H-Hey, isn&#39;t that the Dragon Witch?</p><p><strong>C\uFF1ASoldier:</strong> Why is she fighting the dragons?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1ASoldier:</strong> Don&#39;t ask me, but this is perfect. Let them both go down.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1ASoldier:</strong> They burned my homeland to the ground. I hope both of them die!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Berserk Assassin:</strong> The people you&#39;re protecting are saying all kinds of things about you, my Saint.</p><p><strong>Berserk Assassin:</strong> Even though the only reason they can safely watch this is because you&#39;re dealing with the wyverns.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...Please leave me be.</p><p><strong>Berserk Assassin:</strong> Heh, how stubborn. If you&#39;re worried about your lack of manpower, then by all means, why don&#39;t you ask the French army?</p><p><strong>Berserk Assassin:</strong> Oh, forgive me. You&#39;re the &quot;Dragon Witch&quot; now, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Berserk Assassin:</strong> A saint cruelly burned to death and then resurrected for revenge.</p><p><strong>Berserk Assassin:</strong> A beautiful, ephemeral, and ultimately ridiculous tale. And look, you&#39;re still struggling\u2013</p><p><strong>Berserk Assassin:</strong> Because this time, they see you as the enemy!</p><p><strong>Berserk Assassin:</strong> Can you tell me, Jeanne d&#39;Arc? How do you feel right now?</p><p><strong>Berserk Assassin:</strong> Do you wish to die? Or do you wish to kill?</p><p><strong>Berserk Assassin:</strong> Do you long to drive that flag into those soldiers&#39; hearts like a stake?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...Normally, I&#39;d fall into distress. I&#39;d fall into despair.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> But, unfortunately\u2013I&#39;m an optimist in life. Their hatred of me gives them the strength to rise.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> And that&#39;s a good thing.</p><p><strong>Berserk Assassin:</strong> ...Are you sane?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Good question. People questioned my sanity when I decided to bring salvation to France.</p><p><strong>Berserk Assassin:</strong> Yes. Whether light or dark, it just means both of us are insane!</p><p><strong>Berserk Assassin:</strong> Wyvern!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Ugh!</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> Artillery, FIRE!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Huh?</p><p><strong>Berserk Assassin:</strong> Ugh!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Gilles!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> Prioritize all surrounding dragons! Fire all cannons!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Now!</p><p><strong>Berserk Assassin:</strong> Curse you!</p><p><strong>Berserk Assassin:</strong> Heh\u2013I expect nothing less from a Ruler. Even with your power stolen, your physical strength...</p><p><strong>Berserk Assassin:</strong> Retreat! Lancelot! Sanson!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Wait!</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong> ...A...A\u2014Urrrrrrr!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh?</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> ...It would seem that Jeanne d&#39;Arc has touched the strings of his heart.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> Now what, Carmilla? Will he even listen to reason?</p><p><strong>Berserk Assassin:</strong> ...Retreat! We have no obligation to stay with a black knight that&#39;s lost his mind.</p><p><strong>Berserk Assassin:</strong> Lancelot! Buy us as much time as you can. Until the moment your life is extinguished!</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong> ...Arrrrrrrrrrr!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Ugh! Why are you...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> W-We have to stop them! Master, it&#39;s a once in a lifetime chance!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It breaks the code of chivalry, but we have to bring down Lancelot!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> All right, let&#39;s do it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That&#39;s clearly no longer a knight!</p><hr><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong> A-Arthur...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Arthur? ...You mean your king, Arthur?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> \u2013Unfortunately, I am Jeanne d&#39;Arc. I am not Arthur, the king you seek.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Oh, I see.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What&#39;s wrong?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I know why Lancelot was so obsessed with Jeanne. She resembles Arthur, doesn&#39;t she?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Not her face, but her soul\u2013</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong> My...king...I...please...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Jeanne, let&#39;s go.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Yes!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> Jeanne! Please wait! You are indeed Jeanne d&#39;Arc!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> Not the Dragon Witch, but a bona fide saint!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> ...Shouldn&#39;t you answer?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> If I answer, I will endanger Gilles&#39;s position. For now, we can&#39;t depend on them.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> At the very least, we must endure the scorn of those who once fought by our side.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> But...Do they really hate you?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> \u2013Let&#39;s go.</p><p><strong>Commander:</strong> General. What was that just now...</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know, but...re-examine everything we know of the Dragon Witch.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> Was it truly Jeanne d&#39;Arc who attacked Charles VII? Or some evil imposter?</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> It&#39;s possible...That there may be two Jeanne d&#39;Arcs in this world.</p><h2 id="section-9-pause" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-9-pause" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 9: Pause</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...It looks to be an abandoned fort. Let&#39;s rest here for now.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> How is Siegfried&#39;s wound?</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> My Noble Phantasm can heal wounds, just a bit. But not this one, it seems.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> ...It looks like some kind of curse.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Why were you in that city?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> It seems that I was summoned relatively early.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> I was drifting without a Master...That&#39;s when I saw the town being attacked.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> So you went to rescue them?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Yes...Though it&#39;s not like when I was alive. Still, with Balmung, I managed somehow.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> When you&#39;re attacked by multiple Servants, it&#39;s not easy to pull off.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> ...Then one of them hid me in the castle. My wound wouldn&#39;t heal, and I couldn&#39;t ask anyone for help either.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> I had no choice but to wait.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Was it a woman who could control a dragon?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Dragon? No, it was a turtle...No, a dragon...A dragon turtle...Now that you mention it, is it possible for that kind of dragon to exist?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Oh. She had the aura of a Ruler, similar to what you have.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> It was St. Martha, I&#39;d say.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> So that&#39;s St. Martha, the one who drove off the evil dragon Tarasque. I want to thank her\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> I see, then never mind. I am sure she&#39;s prepared for the worst.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Still, I feel guilty that she saved me when I was useless.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Baptism Rites could probably remove this curse. But, a Servant of considerably high rank must perform it\u2013</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Jeanne, you can do that, can&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...No. I tried, but my power alone isn&#39;t enough.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Multiple curses have been put on Siegfried.... It&#39;s a miracle he&#39;s even alive.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> We need another Saint to remove multiple curses at once.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A Servant who was a saint...Hmm?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...Yes, we do have a chance.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> If St. Jeanne d&#39;Arc...Sorry, Jeanne the &quot;Dragon Witch&quot; has the Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> There is a possibility\u2013that a Saint was summoned as the result of the Counter Force.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> St. Martha was actually summoned, right? Do you guys know any Saint Servants to ask?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> You&#39;re the only Servants that I&#39;ve ever met.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Jeanne and I don&#39;t know any other Servants beside the ones who became enemies.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> ...Staying together is probably safer, but maybe it be better if we split up?</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Unless we remove the curses on &quot;Dragon Slayer&quot;Siegfried, we can&#39;t defeat Fafnir can we?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> But...</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Jeanne?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Oh, well.... It&#39;s nothing.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> You are right. I think that&#39;s a reasonable idea.

Anyway, we&#39;ve got enemies. Let&#39;s deal with them now so we can continue our discussion.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> I just had a great idea!

You tend to be misunderstood by friends.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> I don&#39;t want to hear it from you. Anyway, Maria...</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Yeah?</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Well, never mind. Just be careful along the way. Don&#39;t try to find a pastry shop even if you get hungry.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Oh! My heart beat thinking that you might propose to me again!</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> \u2014Wait. Why would you bring that up now?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Propose? What? Marie? And Amadeus?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Oh, you didn&#39;t know Mash? It&#39;s a pretty popular story.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> When Mr. Amadeus, standing right there, was 6 years old, he proposed to Marie who was 7 years old.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Yes, I reached out to him as he fell, then I saw him staring at me with his starry eyes\u2013</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> &quot;Thank you, nice lady. My name is Amadeus. &quot;</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> &quot;If a beautiful lady like you has no fiance yet, could I be the first one? &quot;</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> He said that to me! I&#39;d never been flattered like that since I was born!</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Who knew the story would get passed down...this is a nightmare...</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Hehehe. Of course it would. I was so happy that I told everybody about it.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> So it was you! You did it! You turned me down! You&#39;re such a femme fatale!</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> I had no choice. After all, I couldn&#39;t decide who would be my fiance.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Besides\u2014</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Besides?</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> You know how my life was after that, don&#39;t you? I was happy with my decision. It was best to turn you down.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> It turned out that you were loved by many people as a musician. That&#39;s why I ended my life as a silly queen.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> It can&#39;t be helped you see, I have no choice because I&#39;m always in love.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Maybe I was in love with a country named France. I only loved the country itself, not the people...</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Because I was such an arrogant woman, I ended up getting killed by the nation.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Marie, that&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> ...What is that? Are you a fool?</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Am I?</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Yes, you are. You&#39;ve got it all wrong. You say you were in love with France?</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> You&#39;re wrong. It&#39;s not that you were in love with the country. France was in love with you.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> \u2014...Yes. Thank you, Mozart.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Wait. Isn&#39;t that strange? Doesn&#39;t that mean that I was killed by the people who loved me?</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> That&#39;s right. That&#39;s how people are.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Love can easily turn to hatred. You were hated precisely because you were loved.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Hated because she was loved...They were in love, yet killed the one they loved...</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> I see. People are complicated. Until I died, well, even after I died, I couldn&#39;t reach love.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> But I think I&#39;m fine with it now.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> I&#39;m Marie Antoinette, a woman loved by France!</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> See you, Amadeus! I&#39;m leaving now! When I come back, let me listen to your piano again!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, Jeanne. Let&#39;s keep in contact with each other at regular intervals.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s a Chaldean communication device. It allows communication via magical energy.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Very well. I&#39;ll hold onto it, then.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Take care.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Be careful.</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Yes, thank you. Fujimaru, please take care as well.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> ...What I just spoke about was out of line. Let&#39;s get going.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Don&#39;t you want to follow her?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Do you still love Marie?</p><hr><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Certainly not. I have no more passion for her. She was just a special divergence in my fate.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> If I&#39;d led a decent life, the divergence would&#39;ve been that proposal.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Like what you&#39;d call the cornerstone of human history.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> What choices would this man, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, have made to end up this way?</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> No matter what happens. No matter what lovers I meet,what friends I gain, what bliss I grasp.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> I would offer my life to music, and become a scum that abandons all human virtue.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> But there&#39;s just one thing.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> If there were someone who could change my fate, I think it would&#39;ve been her.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Amadeus. Doesn&#39;t that mean that you love Marie?</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Oh, sure. I do love her. It&#39;s just that I&#39;m not in love with her any more. Is there a problem with that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I don&#39;t know. Before you said that we humans are filthy.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Based on what you said, that means you think Marie is also filthy without exception...</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> So what? I love anything filthy. Music is beautiful. We humans are filthy.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> You weren&#39;t aware of such differences? It&#39;s just a matter of category, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Well...what? You said that humans only love beautiful things...</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> It&#39;s not that we can only love something beautiful. What I meant was humans can love beautiful things, too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Well...To me, that difference is too abstract...</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Hmm, I guess I can&#39;t make you understand it with words.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> You&#39;ll understand someday. You&#39;re going to continue your journey with Fujimaru, right?</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Then you&#39;ll figure it out. When it comes to the topic of humanity, [\u2642 he /\u2640 she] is an ideal Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Y-Yes! I can completely understand the &quot;ideal Senpai&quot; part!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Trust can be heavy sometimes.</p><hr><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> ...Excuse me. I understand that you guys are talking about something nice, but...</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> It seems enemies are coming. I&#39;m sorry for being insensitive...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou...Fou, Fou!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> \u2014What! Darn! Sieg snatched what I was supposed to do!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> But I hope you&#39;ll understand what made me drop my guard.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> You know, I thought he was as much of a loser as me,but he&#39;s actually a great person with a deep view on life.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Don&#39;t worry about it, Doc. I feel sympathy for you too.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> We are basically good-for-nothing humans...Or adults, I should say.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Yeah, thanks Amadeus! I&#39;ve never been this unhappy with words of comfort!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Enough. Please monitor the battle!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We&#39;re done here. Siegfried, are you all right?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> I&#39;ve recovered enough to walk. Anything but combat should be fine.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> ...I&#39;m going to be making trouble for you a little longer. I&#39;m sorry.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Let&#39;s regroup and set off! I&#39;m going to put everything into detecting Servants!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Jeanne, Jeanne. You have a scary look on your face!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> What? ...D-Do I look scary?</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Hehehe, not so much scary as...Stern?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Well...I guess so. I was doing some thinking.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> You mean about the Dragon Witch?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...Yes. Exactly.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> From the day I was born I&#39;ve received God&#39;s revelations, and I just ran off without even looking back.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I became a Heroic Spirit after I died, and then was summoned as a Ruler.... I accept this fact as part of the natural order of things.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I don&#39;t understand\u2013anything the Dragon Witch says, not a single word.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I wonder...Who that &quot;me&quot; is.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> \u2013Ah, you really are beautiful. Very, very, very\u2013beautiful.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> D-Don&#39;t tease me.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Well, it&#39;s the truth. If I were you\u2013</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> I would probably accept the things the &quot;Dragon Witch&quot; says.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...Marie?</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> I don&#39;t hate the people who executed me. It&#39;s a fact that I&#39;m 90% positive about.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> But the 10% that&#39;s left...Or, it might be much smaller than that.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> I hated those who killed my children\u2013just for a little bit.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> !!!</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> They killed my son Charles, to hurt me...You should truly feel pity for him.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> So, if my version of the Dragon Witch appears,I would probably think &quot;oh, that&#39;s the other me. &quot;</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> And accept the things she says.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> But that&#39;s not the case for you, is it Jeanne? It&#39;s something really great and beautiful.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> It&#39;s not because you don&#39;t want to get dirty, or don&#39;t want to believe you are. Nor does that mean you lack something.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> You like\u2013people, don&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> People who try to move forward by groveling around. The unreasonable ones, the accusers.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...Yes. I do love them. Oh I see, there was no way I could hold a grudge against them\u2013because I loved them.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Yes. That&#39;s why France was saved by you.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> It&#39;s okay, tell the Dragon Witch when you see her.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Tell her? Well, tell her what?</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Say what you want to say out loud.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Say, &quot;You&#39;re not me. &quot;Or, &quot;I don&#39;t know you. &quot;</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Marie...Well, you&#39;re right. Absolutely right.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I certainly\u2013Oh, huh? ...Know you, maybe?</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> You&#39;re starting to look serious again...I&#39;m sorry, it wasn&#39;t of any help?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Y-Yes.... It was very helpful.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> When I confront her next time, I&#39;m sure I can tell her what I want to say.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Yes, you should be fine. Oh, I think it&#39;s time to make our regular contact.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> That&#39;s right we should.

Um, have you ever seen any other Servants besides yourselves?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Well, I&#39;ve seen crazy Servants. Like this one.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Would you mind not lumping me in with them? I&#39;m a Berserker with my reasoning intact.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> What&#39;s your problem?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> What is it?</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> ...Oh, now I remember.

But that&#39;s called shamisen right? Shamisen?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> I&#39;ve said this many times, but would you not lump me in with them?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Anyways! You haven&#39;t seen any Servants other than the &quot;Dragon Witch&quot; or Carmilla&#39;s group, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master...It looks like we&#39;ve just wasted our time.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That sucks.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Elisabeth aside, treating me like that is a little bit rude, don&#39;t you think?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What a shame.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> What&#39;s that about shame! You met ME, and it&#39;s a shame!?</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> We&#39;re looking for a saint.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> We&#39;re only interested in saints.</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Oh. It takes guts to make that comeback...But in any case, a saint?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> I only know of one saint, if you mean someone whose teachings took root deep within this nation.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Really?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Yes. I met him before coming across Elisabeth.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> I almost fought him, but he realized I was a &quot;genuine&quot;Berserker and he sheathed his sword.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> His True Name is Georgios. I believe he is quite a famous saint around here.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Georgios! The saint referred to as St. George.... Yes, he would be perfect.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Do you know where he went?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> That&#39;s the real shame. He went the opposite direction as me, to the west.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The west...That&#39;s where Jeanne and the others went. Commencing communication!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...Yes, we&#39;re fine. We detected a Servant over here as well.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I&#39;m about to make contact right now.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Please stop right there. Who are you?</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> I am a Servant. My class is Rider,but my True Name is Marie Antoinette.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> ...I see, you are not under Madness Enhancement.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Yes. I&#39;m on the side opposing them, and this is\u2013</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> I see...She is the holy maiden. Best we keep her name undisclosed.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> This city has been razed by the Witch and her dragon. I was able to make them retreat, but that won&#39;t happen again.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...Then, will you come join us?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Our &quot;Dragon Slayer&quot; is cursed, and we need to remove it immediately.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> However, multiple curses are entwined together, so both you and I must be present...</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> I understand the situation.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> ...The residents have already started to evacuations. Let us depart once that has completed.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Thank you very much!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> A wyvern attack? There&#39;s been a lot of violence lately.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> No, that wasn&#39;t it. This sensation...It&#39;s the &quot;Dragon Witch! &quot;</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> What did you say?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Let&#39;s retreat, Georgios! We don&#39;t stand a chance against her right now!</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> ...But we can&#39;t do that yet.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Oh...</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> The civilians aren&#39;t evacuated. The mayor has entrusted me with their protection.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> I must fulfill that wish\u2013Or else, I won&#39;t be able to stay a saint.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> But...</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> ...I know. If I stay, I will die.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> But even so\u2013I can&#39;t abandon them.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Lord Georgios, you are a man who is thick in head and body.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> What was that?</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> But, the part of you that is terribly cute has touched my heart.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> And so\u2014Please allow me to take over that duty.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> What?</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> I am the Queen of France.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Even though that is in the &quot;future&quot; from here, for me neither &quot;past&quot; nor &quot;present&quot; make much difference.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Protecting the citizens is an important duty for me too, and you are now given a duty that can change everything.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> St. Georgios, go with Jeanne d&#39;Arc and please lift the curse from the &quot;Dragon Slayer. &quot;</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> In the name of Marie Antoinette, I will make sure to protect this city.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> P-Please wait up! Wait, hey wait! Marie!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Marie, let us stay and fight with you! You can&#39;t do it alone, but I am sure the two of us can\u2014</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Non. That makes me very happy, but you cannot, Jeanne.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> I am sure I was summoned for precisely this moment.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Not to harbor hatred or defeat enemies, but to protect the people.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> So that at this time, I will protect those dear to me. To save my dear country, I will do what is right.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Oh, but please apologize to Amadeus for me. I never got to hear him play after all.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> He was 6, and I was 7. Since then, we&#39;ve passed each other, but never met.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Marie!</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Lord Georgios, do you agree to this arrangement?</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> ...If you are fine with it, I will humbly yield this role to you.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...Marie...</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Now go, Jeanne. As short as our time was, it was the greatest honor to fight under your flag.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Yes.... I will be waiting.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll catch up soon.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Sanson, you&#39;re here.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> Of course I am. Execution needs qualifications. For both the executioner, and the executed.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> No other person has the right to execute you. You should have realized that Marie.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> ...Let&#39;s see ...Hold on a second, Sanson. I know that you are a wonderful executioner.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> I mean, you&#39;re cruel, merciliess, and inhuman, but you never once mocked criminals.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> You guarded the guillotine with great respect, so I do indeed trust you.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> But, does that mean you alone hold the right to kill me? Isn&#39;t that a bit absurd?</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> It&#39;s not absurd. I was born into a family of executioners, and I was only taught how to execute.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> No compromise. It&#39;s not only about dedication,I am particular about the method\u2014the technique.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> It&#39;s natural for a good executioner to not inflict pain on the criminal. I see beyond that.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> I see the\u2014ecstasy. The moment it feels so good that &quot;it will kill you. &quot;</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> That is the type of beheading I dedicate myself to. The best slice of my life was my &quot;kiss&quot; for you.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> So, this is destiny. I couldn&#39;t help but want to see you so I could ask...</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> Please, tell me, Marie.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> How was my beheading? Were you able to climax at the very end?</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> ...I can see that you seriously showed respect for me Sanson, from the bottom of your heart.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> But, I&#39;m sorry. That&#39;s just impossible. It&#39;s something that I cannot possibly say...</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> I already know enough men with perverse hobbies. Terribly sorry, but I can&#39;t accept a second kiss from you.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> Yes, I know. But I&#39;m sure you will be delighted,I&#39;ve gotten even better than back then.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> That is why I was summoned as a Servant. I shall give you the final ecstasy once again!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> If we hurry, we might still make it in time.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Right, if we lose them for the sake of my revival, that would be a great loss.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I have a reading...Unfortunately, an enemy. Please hurry and defeat it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Full power.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Understood.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes Master! Now, please stand back!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> That&#39;s, impossible! How could I be defeated?</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> I&#39;ve killed so many since that day, and become so much stronger...So why?</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> How sad, Charles-Henri Sanson. I should&#39;ve told you when we reunited.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Our relationship ended that day.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Because your blade was truly\u2014rusty.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> You&#39;ve killed so many people that it&#39;s lost its way. You&#39;ve increased your proficiency as a killer.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Executioners and killers are not the same, Sanson. The more skilled you become at killing others\u2014</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> The rustier your blade as an executioner, savior of criminals, becomes.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> By the time you followed the Dragon Witch, you were no longer the Sanson I knew.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> No...Lies! It cannot be! I kept my faith that you would come! That&#39;s why I kept honing my skills!</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> To see you, and behead you with more skill\u2014Give you a much better ecstatic moment!</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> I thought that by doing so, you would surely forgive me!</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> ...Geez. You really are a pitiful, adorable person. I don&#39;t hold a grudge against you.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> From the beginning, you never had the need to be forgiven by me.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> Ah...aah, ah\u2014</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...That makes three. It&#39;s ironic how the ones who show potential are the first to fall.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Yes. Perhaps the two vampires you loathe may be the last ones standing.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Good day, &quot;Dragon Witch. &quot;It seems you got here a little too late.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> &quot;Myself&quot; has already escaped. \u2013How pitiful.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> No, that&#39;s not true. She left here embracing hope.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Just by gaining one Servant? How ridiculous.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Speaking of ridiculous, it&#39;s amazing that you are still here.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Are you intoxicated with the idea of saving these citizens?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> You, the person killed by her citizens. A woman put to the guillotine, beheaded in ridicule!</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> So disappointing. Witches don&#39;t understand such simple logic?</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> It&#39;s true that I was executed. There was ridicule, and there was disdain.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> However\u2013that gives me no reason to murder them in return.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> I became a queen because the people asked me to. A queen cannot be without her people.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Thus, it was inevitable. If they don&#39;t want you,then you exit even if you don&#39;t want to.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> That is the destiny of those serving their country. I believe my execution led to my people&#39;s next smile.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> No matter when, viva la France! Stars glimmer, and that will do. That&#39;s all we need.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Now I am certain. Say\u2013&quot;Dragon Witch. &quot;</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> &quot;Who are you exactly? &quot;</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...Shut up!</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> \u2013Deploy Noble Phantasm. &quot;Crystal Palace!! &quot;</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> ...Goodbye Jeanne, it was lovely meeting you.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> If I can help the Saint who saved France...No, if I can help a friend.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Then I will gladly shed the last of my radiance and fall.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> Like a star, like a flower. Like a fleeting dream.</p><p><strong>Marie Antoinette:</strong> That is what a Servant is,and how Marie Antoinette lives\u2013!</p><h2 id="section-11-baptism-rite" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-11-baptism-rite" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 11: Baptism Rite</h2><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Mash!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, thank goodness! And who is\u2013</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> My name is Georgios.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> ...Where&#39;s Maria?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Marie is...</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> I see. That&#39;s what she said when she stayed behind? Oh well, it can&#39;t be helped.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> You don&#39;t have to feel bad. Even if we were there,she would&#39;ve done the same thing.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Maria is an eternal philanthropist. That&#39;s how she lives and dies.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> But never mind that, why don&#39;t you reverse Siegfried&#39;s curse?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> R-Right!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Amadeus...</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> It&#39;s all right, I knew this was going to happen. Remember how Maria was talking about the piano?</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> See, that was her way of saying goodbye. It never happened when we were alive.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> If she&#39;d said to me &quot;Let me hear your piano,&quot;I couldn&#39;t have stopped her.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> But, the second farewell hits hard. Worse than the first. All the more as we&#39;ll never meet again.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Eh...Um, if you are Heroic Spirits, wouldn&#39;t there be a chance to see each other again?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Like now, you may be called to the same battlefield...</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Mm, that won&#39;t happen, I think? There are as many Heroic Spirits as the stars.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> How I came across her this time was already a miracle. Though, a whimsical Master might change things a bit.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Anyway, I&#39;m a bit tired. I&#39;m going to excuse myself,call for me when you&#39;re ready to leave.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Wait...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You shouldn&#39;t, Mash.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Stop Mash.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master, but\u2013</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> It&#39;s fine. Everyone has moments where they want to be alone.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> That&#39;s right, Mash, you don&#39;t understand a man&#39;s heart quite yet.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You&#39;re right. Now that aside...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Why are YOU here?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> It&#39;s fine, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> You don&#39;t approve of us being here? We&#39;re willing to assist you in combat.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Well, that is something to be thankful for, but...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> By the way, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Who?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ME?</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Of course you. Though temporary, can you enter a contract with me?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Yes, sticking out your pinky is enough.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> This is a pinky promise, if you lie, I&#39;ll make you swallow a thousand needles...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> This completes the contract! Just so you know...I really will make you swallow a thousand needles if you lie.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Is that clear? Please take care of me from now on.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master, Jeanne&#39;s group seems to have succeeded in lifting Siegfried&#39;s curse!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Okay, you will be fine from now on. This would probably have been impossible by myself.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...It&#39;s all thanks to Marie. We were able to survive because of her.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> What she risked her life protecting is something I want to protect too.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> This era, this world, this country\u2013To do so,let&#39;s defeat the &quot;Dragon Witch&quot; and, the dragon.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> \u2013All right, I can move now. I apologize for all your efforts, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> No, Master...The more correct way to put it is,I appreciate all your efforts from the bottom of my heart.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> I shall entrust my sword to you. This body will be my Master&#39;s sword and shield.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> My True Name is Siegfried. I have no other skill than slaying dragons, but I&#39;d be honored to be put to use.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That sound...It&#39;s the wyverns!</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> ...It looks like it&#39;s my turn already. Please command me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I will leave them to you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Let&#39;s go get them.</p><hr><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Yeah. \u2013My name is Siegfried, here I go!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> All right, now we have ourselves a team.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s right Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Let&#39;s attack Orleans.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Let&#39;s take down the dragon.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes! Understood Master!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> ...Hmph. I wouldn&#39;t mind helping you out with that, little Puppy.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> My, my, Elisabeth, calling my Love a Puppy is an insult.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> ...Did you just make a ridiculous word change? Well, I don&#39;t care.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> I&#39;m not a cheap dragon. I will meet an extra-special Master someday!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Oh, so the horn on your head isn&#39;t the only thing twisted. Seeking an impossible dream...Is your head okay?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> It&#39;s not an impossible dream! It&#39;s conviction! I&#39;m convinced of it!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> I&#39;ll someday meet a Master that is to my liking and will love me!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Yes, yes, in your head it&#39;s another cloudless day.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> ...Our team sure is a lively one. Of course, I will be in your service.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Oh, heading out already? Then I&#39;ll tag along. I&#39;ve come this far, might as well see the end.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Fujimaru. No, Master.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Right now, I am merely a powerless Servant.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> But I wish to protect this world. Please, fight with me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Of course.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That is our duty.</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Thank you so much!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Let&#39;s make camp here tonight to prepare for tomorrow&#39;s showdown...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> First, we&#39;ll have to secure the area. Everyone prepare for battle, we&#39;re surrounded.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Don&#39;t draw too much attention, and refrain from any flash attacks so we can end this soon...Wait.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Fujimaru,I don&#39;t see Mash or Amadeus anywhere...</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Well crap, I just came to get a bit of water. How unlucky of me to be assaulted by enemies.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Amadeus, over here! I&#39;ll go up to the front line, so please hide behind me!</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> I&#39;d take up your offer...but I can&#39;t. This time the situation is different.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> I can&#39;t run away if the front line is just you, Mash. Let me fight with you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Amadeus? Will you be all right? You&#39;ll get hurt, you know!</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Oh, it&#39;s a rehearsal to prepare for tomorrow&#39;s battle. A few wounds? No worries.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Whew! We made it through in one piece, but we accidentally left the forest during the battle.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Fujimaru and Jeanne must be worried. Let&#39;s rest awhile, then return to camp.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Um. It seems a bit crazy to ask questions at a time like this, but do you mind?</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Of course not. Be it important or trivial, ask away.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Tomorrow is the final battle. You should wrap up any unfinished business.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Right. I hate to bring this back up...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But it&#39;s about when we heard that Marie had died. This is what you said, Amadeus.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> &quot;Humans choose what they love. &quot;I don&#39;t understand what that meant.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Rather, I understand the meaning of the words,it&#39;s the &quot;choose&quot; part that I don&#39;t understand.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I mean, things we should view favorably are morally just,and things we should reject are socially bad.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s what I was taught. I feel deep down that it&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Hmm. What do you consider right then?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Well...Something that saves many lives, and sees value in many lives, I suppose.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> That&#39;s rather ill-defined. Let&#39;s assume for a moment that Fujimaru were not such a person. What then?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But that&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Forgive me, that was a mean assumption. However, keep that hesitation and discomfort in mind.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Mash, I suspect that you are a person who has only recently gained her freedom.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> As such, you freeze in the face of hard choices and have doubts about the person you are becoming.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Yes, I think you might be right. I, uh...didn&#39;t know much about the outside world.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...No. Maybe I never had the right to care for anything in the first place.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I mean, I\u2014</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Oh, dear. You truly are pure, aren&#39;t you? You&#39;re like a music sheet without a single note on it.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> But heed my words, Mash. Even if you are a doll created for the sole purpose of fighting...</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> ...You have the obligation to care for something. You may not have freedom, but you have obligations.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Obligations? Not rights or privileges?</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> No, obligations. Or duties, if you like.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Humans have that responsibility, for they possess the intelligence to think.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> What to care for, what to dislike, what is considered precious, what is considered evil.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Those are the things you must choose for your self. Not by the words of others, nor by conforming to your environment.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Every human is unique. So too is each one&#39;s values.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> We learn and see as much as we can. By doing so, your life will be enriched.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Listen, the world is not what you make of it. You are what the world makes of you.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Then when you have become you, become more than this world.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> You must leave proof that you existed, whatever it is. I have. All the music I left behind is proof.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Even though\u2014that itself is insignificant.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ???</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> After all, I am a man who couldn&#39;t even bear witness to the death of his one and only first love.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> My legacy may have been loved by many, but my actual life was nothing special.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Still, I am content with that. Human beings are filthy and unpleasant. My conclusion stands.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> There are sinners who shine brilliantly and saints that make one retch. So there is no need for you to fear your own future.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> You are created by the world, and you expand and improve the world.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> That is what &quot;being a human&quot; is all about.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Begin by absorbing all you can from the world and then return those favors to the world as you see fit later.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Worrying over what results that will have is a matter for another day.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Amadeus...</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> However, most things in this world have a fair value, and a result fit for such value.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> As was the case with my music and my life.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> As long as humans are human, evil will not prevail. After all, humanity will be unable to flourish otherwise.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> It is said that &quot;evil&quot; is the hindrance to the prosperity of life. The species cannot survive with it there.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> If humanity cannot purge itself of that &quot;evil,&quot; that is the day of humanity&#39;s extinction. It&#39;s that simple.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> ...I see that you are now breathing more calmly. Our break is over Mash, let&#39;s return to the others.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Most likely this is the last time we shall chat. For some reason, it turned into a bit of a lecture.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Still, I&#39;m happy that we were alone for this final talk. From start to finish, you&#39;re a charming young lady.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> In this battle, I would have proposed to you had Maria not been there.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I see. Thank you great composer Amadeus,I won&#39;t forget what you said.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Indeed. You pass, Mademoiselle.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> I want you to remember one last thing. There&#39;s nothing more beautiful than a parting smile.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The supplies have arrived, but apparently there&#39;s been a shift in topological space.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Our rations are being devoured by monsters. Senpai, are you okay with being hungry?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I suppose not. Let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Hey, I had my eye on that! Don&#39;t eat it!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> You are so annoying!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Hey, that looks good.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Then allow me to feed you, say &quot;ahhh. &quot;</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...What&#39;s gotten into you?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Hello, is this seat taken?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Oh, no! Be my guest.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> I&#39;m sorry to be a bother while you&#39;re relaxing, but those dragons over there are too noisy.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ......Amadeus. Marie was very kind to me.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> But of course. She was kind to everyone, but her affection for you was unique.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Why do you suppose that was? Because I&#39;m a fellow Frenchwoman?</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> I&#39;m not sure. I don&#39;t think it had anything to do with you being French.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Whether one is from England, Spain, or the Far East, that is of no importance to Maria.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> The reason she was fond of you, that she held you in high esteem, was because you were a young woman who took a stand all on her own.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> In a sense, Maria is the same. She became a queen at 14 and was forced into battle all alone in Versailles.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> ...Of course, I&#39;m sure that her battles paled in comparison to yours.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Battlefields with cannonballs and conspiracies are in truth, fundamentally different.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Nevertheless, it was indeed a life or death struggle for her. That is why she empathized with you.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Because she was living through a lonely battle of her own?</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> And one other reason. This is the important one.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> For Maria, standing up for a loved one is a perfectly reasonable thing to do.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Be it family, another person, a Servant\u2013or even the nation itself.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> True, she was a sheltered girl who knew no hardship, so her way of standing up for someone was rather off-key.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...Oh, is that so? In that case, I wanted to stand up for her as a friend.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Given the situation, nothing could&#39;ve been done,but I wish\u2013I could&#39;ve been by her side.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...I like to believe so.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> A friend, eh? Yes, you thinking of her that way would be the ultimate reward for her.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Maria and I have one thing in common. We were not blessed with friends.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> But, her wish was fulfilled in this second life. I get the feeling she was able to move on with a light heart.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Um...Actually, I think of you as a comrade. Fujimaru feels the same too.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> No, no, that won&#39;t do. After all, I don&#39;t think that of you. Maria said it, remember? I&#39;m fundamentally trash.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> I only love music. That is how I lived my life, and I am proud of that fact.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> That is why I cannot make friends. Instead, I left behind many pieces of music.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> If I had any desire for human happiness, I would vanish in a cloud of self-hatred.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Still, thank you Jeanne d&#39;Arc. I&#39;m sure that Maria had no regrets.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I shall avenge her.... No, vengeance isn&#39;t important, is it?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I will make her wish come true. I will save this France.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Gilles, are you here?</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> Yes, right here!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Marie Antoinette has perished, but what about Sanson?</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> I am treating him right now. His mind perished with her.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> All we can do is to keep his Spiritron Shell intact, and use him as a foot soldier.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...I see. Georgios escaped from that town.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Had Marie not sacrificed herself to buy time, our plan would have worked\u2013</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> Ah, I see. The enemy ranks lost one, but also gained one.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> We&#39;re not at a disadvantage here, but it is a nuisance. Continue searching for them\u2013</p><p><strong>Berserk Saber:</strong> It doesn&#39;t look like that will be necessary.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Saber? I thought I ordered you to search the southeastern region.</p><p><strong>Berserk Saber:</strong> There&#39;s no longer any need, Master. They&#39;re heading straight for Orleans.</p><p><strong>Berserk Saber:</strong> Looks like it&#39;s a final showdown they want. Don&#39;t you want the same thing?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...So, they&#39;ve stopped running around have they? Which means they think they have a shot at winning.</p><p><strong>Berserk Saber:</strong> I suppose they do. They have many Servants as well.</p><p><strong>Berserk Saber:</strong> We might have dragons on our side, but this should still be a glorious fight.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> You&#39;re enjoying yourself?</p><p><strong>Berserk Saber:</strong> Of course. As you know, I&#39;m not right in the head. I&#39;ll be just as happy with wiping them out as being wiped out by them.</p><p><strong>Berserk Saber:</strong> Go on, order me\u2013Master.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Prepare for the final battle. Gilles, summon them, not just the Servants.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> Understood. I shall gather all the dragons who were slain in France.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...If we win, the world will be destroyed. Even if we lose, it will make no difference.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> The world is long gone. Even if they correct this place, an endless journey lies ahead.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> And yet...And yet, they have faith in the world\u2013Those people, and &quot;me. &quot;</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> In that case, I shall smite them. I won&#39;t let them reconnect this world.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> That is my wish, and Gilles&#39; wish.... Yes, that should be my wish\u2014</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> I seem to be the only one here with experience leading an army.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Of course, it&#39;s not as if I have a glorious military record where I led an army to invade a worthwhile country.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> In any event, our numbers are few while the enemy&#39;s are large.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> ...But, most of the enemy&#39;s forces are weaker than us. In situations like this, there are two options.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> A frontal assault, or an ambush from the rear. However, our location was given away long ago.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Stealth is out of the question. The enemy knows where we are...There&#39;s only one option.</p><p><strong>Both:</strong> A frontal assault.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> ...Exactly.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Master and I will see to Fafnir.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> I want the others to protect us from Servants and wyverns.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Whether we slay Fafnir or not, the outcome of this war hinges on that question.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Understood. I&#39;m inexperienced, but I&#39;ll fight with everything I have.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Oh Puppy, there is someone I must fight.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Would it be all right if I focus on her.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Go ahead.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Oh?

So I created a new you!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> The Saint I believed in! The Saint I longed for! I created her!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> Jeanne d&#39;Arc\u2013the Dragon Witch. The Grail itself!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...I see. But of course, she never learned that did she?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Gilles, even if you could revive me, I would never become your Dragon Witch.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> It&#39;s true that I was betrayed, it&#39;s true that I was mocked.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> It could only be described\u2013as a tragic end.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> But I could never hate my homeland. This is where you and the others lived.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> ...So kind. Your words are far too kind. However, Jeanne...</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> Your kindness has made you forget one thing. Even if you never hated this country\u2013</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> I HATED THIS COUNTRY! I swore I would destroy it for its betrayal!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Gilles...</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> You will forgive them I&#39;m sure. But I never will! Not God! Not the King! Not the nation!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> I&#39;ll destroy them all. I&#39;ll kill them all. That is the wish I made upon the Grail!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> DO NOT GET IN MY WAY, JEANNE D&#39;ARC!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...Yes, you&#39;re right. You&#39;re absolutely right.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> It makes perfect sense for you to hate, and for you to use the Grail&#39;s power to destroy France.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> And I\u2013I will stop you. As a Ruler, the judge of the Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I will stand in your way Gilles de Rais!</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> Then you are my enemy now.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> Let us finish this Jeanne d&#39;Arc, savior of France\u2014!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Let us indeed!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master, I&#39;ve confirmed the presence of the Grail. Your orders!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> This is the last battle.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Get ready.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Right! Moving to recover the Grail! Mash Kyrielight\u2013here I go!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> Not, possible! Even with the power of the Grail, I still...fell...</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> That&#39;s not possible! Such nonsense can&#39;t be true! I-I am still...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Gilles. Enough.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Get some rest. You did such a good job.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Believing in a little girl who had no clue, you even liberated this town.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...No matter who you are now, I believe in who you were back then.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Don&#39;t worry. Until the very end, I have no regrets.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> My death will light the way for someone else. That&#39;s all I ever wanted.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Now let&#39;s go back to the time where we belong.</p><p><strong>Gilles:</strong> ...Jeanne. I&#39;m the only one of us who should go to Hell\u2013</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The Grail recovery is complete! The timeline restoration is about to start!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Rayshift preparations are ready! Get back here, now!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Understood Doctor!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> You&#39;re leaving? So soon?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I have work to do.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I have to go.</p><hr><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Oh do you? Hmmph...Well, I&#39;ve achieved my goal, so I suppose it&#39;s fine.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Goodbye Little Puppy, you fought fairly well.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> \u2013Oh my, this is goodbye? Don&#39;t worry Master.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> I can be rather persistent. No matter where you go, I&#39;ll follow.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> That&#39;s what love is, after all.... You know?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Farewell.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> ...It seems that everything is over. The wyverns are disappearing.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> This wasn&#39;t exactly a normal Holy Grail War. But still, it was an honor to fight with the Dragon Slayer.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> I never thought I&#39;d get a chance to fight with the famous St. George.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> But from the look of things, it won&#39;t be long before we&#39;re summoned again.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Yes, that Master&#39;s journey seems to be a long one. I hope we can aid them again\u2013</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> My role is finally over, huh? I&#39;m so tired. I worked so hard my butt hurts.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> ...Oh, I&#39;m not supposed to make those sort of jokes. Sorry.</p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> Excellent conducting nonetheless, Fujimaru. A masterful performance all around.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AGilles:</strong> Jeanne!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Gilles!</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AGilles:</strong> What happened? Wait, you&#39;re alive?</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AGilles:</strong> France is in ruins, but...If you&#39;re alive, that&#39;s enough!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...No, that&#39;s not true.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AGilles:</strong> What\u2013?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I&#39;m sure on some level you understand. This world is nothing but an ephemeral dream.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I died, and you\u2013sorrowed. That is history. That is unchangeable fate.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AGilles:</strong> Jeanne...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> But in a different form, in a different way, we&#39;ll be able to fight together...I can feel it.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> So this is but a temporary goodbye.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AGilles:</strong> You truly are...No, even in death, you still care for this country...</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AGilles:</strong> Forgive us, Jeanne d&#39;Arc! We...France betrayed you!</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AGilles:</strong> Ooooohh!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> It&#39;s all right. Let&#39;s at least leave this world with a smile.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master...It&#39;s time.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Master and Mash.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I expect that my meeting with you Mash,and Fujimaru, our battles, even the lives we lost...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> All of this will disappear, won&#39;t it? That makes me a little sad.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...Of course, it&#39;s a joyous thing that lives lost will return to us.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> But I feel like I&#39;ll meet you again somewhere. My intuition can be pretty good, you know?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> \u2013Farewell. And thank you.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Even if all this disappears beyond the void, I&#39;m sure something will\u2013</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Welcome back Mash, Fujimaru! Good work!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Thanks to you, the first Grand Order was completed successfully.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> \u2014Yes, excellent job. We had few supplies, no personnel...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...and the Rayshift was still at an experimental stage, yet you both did such a fine job.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I say this on behalf of all surviving members of Chaldea...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> You are now full-grown Mages, and Chaldea is very proud of you!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou! Fooou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Fou made it back too. Are we sure it&#39;s not a lucky animal of some sort?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Oh, welcome back. You guys look tired.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Here&#39;s your latest observation records. Take a look, Doctor.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Hm...Oooohh!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> We did it! 15th century France is restored completely! Still six to go, but\u2013</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Part of human history is in its rightful place! We did it, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. But Doctor\u2013we never saw Lev Lainur.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> He was not in France?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Yes, he&#39;s probably hiding in one of the other 6 eras.... No, I guess he wouldn&#39;t hide.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> He has more than enough power. If he&#39;s in the same time as us, he&#39;ll act.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll see him eventually. Until then, we need to get stronger.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Well, details like that don&#39;t matter!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> That&#39;s the end of our mission for today!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I bet you want a warm bed and a shower, right? Go back to your room and rest.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, that plan sounds absolutely wonderful. See you later Doctor.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, and Senpai...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Good work today. Let&#39;s get back to it tomorrow!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You too Mash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Yes, thank you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Once again, I wasn&#39;t able to help you at all...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But I&#39;m finally starting to think I can do this.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Together, I think we can make it through the next six eras.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You feeling okay?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, just fine.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A Demi-Servant&#39;s body has incredible strength,endurance, and self-healing abilities.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;ll be back to top health in just a short while.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You need to rest though, get some sleep.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Maybe you should have the Doctor take a look at you, he is a doctor after all.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What&#39;s wrong?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Need something?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No, I was just thinking of Gilles de Rais.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I knew his history, or so I thought. His heart was broken by Jeanne&#39;s death...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> In our history, he became a murderer who killed hundreds of children.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...That bloody France was what he wanted. It was an appropriate sight for a murderer.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But still, even then\u2013His real wish was for Jeanne d&#39;Arc to live.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That was the source of his rage, and his hatred. A pure rage that could destroy a country\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Raw feelings are powerful, aren&#39;t they? They can destroy the world\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> He was human, after all.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Because he was human. Amadeus said something similar, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I don&#39;t have the experience they do. I don&#39;t have those deep feelings, or a heart that can handle them.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But I&#39;d like to learn them if I could. Even if I don&#39;t understand, I can learn a little at a time.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I think that&#39;s what Amadeus was talking about.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;ll see you tomorrow. Good night.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Sweet dreams. May the blessing of the Saint be upon us.</p>',2755),a=[s];function i(g,h){return t(),o("div",null,a)}var l=e(r,[["render",i],["__file","orleans.html.vue"]]);export{l as default};
