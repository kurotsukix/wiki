Do you know why?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (shake head)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Right Senpai, I don&#39;t understand his ideas either.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (nod)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai, you can understand the idea behind his words. But I...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou...</p><hr><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> I achieved valor in Gaul and Britannia. That is a fact, and it was written down as well.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> I guess you could say that I was young. But, that was not all.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> I escaped. It felt slightly better to preoccupy myself with service by sword than the schemes surging through Rome.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Betrayal for betrayal, conspiracy for conspiracy. It&#39;s easy for me to climb the ladder of power as such.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> After all\u2013</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> I am a descendant of the goddess of love and beauty, and a man who fathered a child with a female fairy.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> My beauty makes women fall into my hands at will. Add in my intelligence and I&#39;m the best at scheming.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> But...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Beauty?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> He said beauty, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Actually, scheming takes quite a bit of courage. At first you feel nothing, but gradually. Gradually.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> While I bite into juicy grapes, while I fool around with women, political enemies die off by my schemes\u2013</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> But when it&#39;s being repeated over and over, you start to feel sick, as if something&#39;s been tainted.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> That is why, at times, I escaped to the battlefield.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I now finally understand. Gaius Julius Caesar.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You seek to settle all the escaping you did right here and right now.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> That&#39;s right. I\u2013wait, enemies. They must have noticed us.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Enemy signatures are approaching! Is this like, remnants of the United Empire army?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Rome should be correcting itself now, so why are there United Empire soldiers still left?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> I&#39;ll tell you later. Before that Fujimaru, hurry up and drive them off.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> I will take command for you. I am a great commander.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Caesar, you fight too!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You&#39;re a Saber and you&#39;re hanging back?</p><hr><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Saber, right, Saber. Saber. By rights I shouldn&#39;t even be in the Saber class.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> ...I only unsheathe my sword when I&#39;m next to a beauty.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Why look at me...</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Not knowing your own beauty is equal to a crime, yes? Well anyways, I shall unsheathe my sword. Oh, brother\u2013</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> ...I guess that&#39;s it. Makes me sick.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Wielding a sword like this gets me fired up with nostalgia. Though, swordfights are the epitome of nuisances.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> I seem to be escaping even now that I am a Heroic Spirit. How pathetic!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Why are you so angry?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Despite the lack of scheming?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, Senpai&#39;s question is legitimate. Caesar, what is upsetting you?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You are already a Heroic Spirit, unrelated to the bloodstained schemes of ancient Rome.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> And still... You end up returning to Rome with us, why?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> I&#39;ve said it many times. It is to escape.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> To put it nicely, it&#39;s to settle things. Oh, it also answers this Doctor guy&#39;s question.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> You mean these United Empire remnants? For some reason, they&#39;re still around...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Whoa, another enemy attack as we speak! Is this area under the United Empire influence?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Right.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> What?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We&#39;re entering combat, Master! Your orders, please!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> \u2013Battle complete. Soldiers perceived as United Empire are retreating.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> After them. If they&#39;re headed home, it&#39;ll save us the trouble of searching.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Search? Search for what\u2013</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> I&#39;ll go on ahead.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Please wait\u2013 Oh, h-he&#39;s fast!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> He&#39;s pretty nimble for his size.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I expect nothing less from a Saber.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Y-Yes... No, well\u2013</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> You guys should chase them, too! I don&#39;t know what he&#39;ll do, but you can&#39;t abandon him!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Understood!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We&#39;ve caught up. Caesar is right there\u2013</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> You&#39;re finally here. Perfect, you can see me face my own foolishness.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Face?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...I am a distinguished general of Rome.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I&#39;m the general that conquered Gaul, and made a successful expedition to Britannia.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I slaughtered the great general Pompey. I&#39;m the only ruler of Rome, the origin of its Emperor.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I danced within the cruelty of Rome, and also danced in the battlefield.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I shall continue fighting. As long as Rome exists, my dance continues.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> No, that horrible dance ends here. This is the end of your escapism.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> A general? The origin of Emperor? That is quite absurd!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> You are merely escaping! You pig!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> You could not grant the wish of the one woman you loved, and you chose not to name your loving child as your heir!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I am! I am Caesar! The origin of all Roman Emperors!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> That&#39;s right, you are me! My unsightly half that still clings onto Rome!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I see, I get it now! Residual effects of the Second Holy Grail is what &quot;that&quot; is!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> So that&#39;s why it&#39;s leading the United Empire remnants. In other words, &quot;that&quot; is like Caesar&#39;s shadow!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> He sensed its presence, and guided you guys all the way here\u2013!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> He could have just said so.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That is indeed hard to mention.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Yes.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> I apologize, beautiful friends. I&#39;d like to defeat my ugly escapism half right here.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> ...No, I want to return it to myself. Lend me your powers.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Understood!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, Senpai!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Oh... Ooooh! I am! I am Caesar! I am!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Shut up, you pig! Such ugliness will scatter like flower petals before my beauty!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> ...Begone my foolish past.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Confirming zero response. Battle&#39;s over, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou...</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Whew, I&#39;m tired. Indeed, I am not fit to fight at the front line.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Let us hurry back to this Chaldea and rest. I won&#39;t move one step further.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Thanks for the hard work.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Thank you for your hard work. Senpai, Doctor, please start the return process to Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Yes, yes, return\u2013 Hmm? Looks like Caesar&#39;s magical capacity has increased?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> After defeating his own shadow, he absorbed it as his own magical energy I guess?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, Fou!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Yes, yes, the return process.
