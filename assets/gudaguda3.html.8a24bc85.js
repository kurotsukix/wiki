My apologies for not introducing her sooner.</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong> Yaaay.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> She&#39;s not a Servant, but she&#39;s just as capable as one.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You sure she&#39;s not stronger than most Servants?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I saw her deflect that bullet like it was nothing.</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong> That is a super-classified Oryou trade secret. Still, you&#39;re really durable, for a human.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> And I&#39;m Sakamoto Ryouma, a Rider. Maybe you&#39;ve heard of me, if you know any Japanese history?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I read about you in a textbook. You&#39;re a Meiji Restoration hero!</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> Haha... I&#39;m honored. I never imagined I would end up in the history books someday!</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong> Yaaay. This calls for sekihan for dinner.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Umm... You&#39;re from Tosa and were active during the Bakumatsu era...</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong> You are very knowledgeable. Maybe even more than Oryou.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> A Meiji Restoration hero, huh...</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> I see. So your name is Fujimaru, and you&#39;re the Master of Chaldea.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You know about Chaldea?</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> Nope. Not at all. Far as I can tell, you look to be a visitor from elsewhere.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That&#39;s me. Master extraordinaire.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> I know some of them are backups, but to command that many Servants...</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> Truly impressive.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> ...As for that Servant who seems quite concerned about your well-being...</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> ...maybe it&#39;s time she introduced herself as well?</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong> I&#39;m...a Servant...I think.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong> ...Was I Okita? Do you know me, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You do look like Okita, but...</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> So...you&#39;re THE Okita? Or maybe, a different aspect of her?</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> No, I shouldn&#39;t be surprised. Anything could happen here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Have you ever heard of Alters?</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> Short for \u201Calternative,\u201D right? When a different side of a Heroic Spirit manifests, if I&#39;m not mistaken.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...Okita. Is that my name? If you say it is, Master, then it must be.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> So this is an Alter...</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> Still, I didn&#39;t think this was a particularly common occurrence.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> Tell me, do you happen to know any other Altered Heroic Spirits?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Uh...yeah, you could say I know...a few...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I think another one just showed up recently.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> That IS a surprise. You really know that many, do you?</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> You are not just any Master, it would seem.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> Right, then. Why don&#39;t I explain what is happening here.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> Oryou, would you make some tea for our guests?</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> ...Oryou?</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong> ...Huh!? Tea? Right, tea.</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong> Certainly, Boss. Oryou&#39;ll even throw in some saliva, too.

I&#39;m glad I won&#39;t have to waste any time explaining Holy Grail Wars, then.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> ...As you know, a typical Holy Grail War is a battle between seven Servants for the Grail itself.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> We are in a sort of variation of that. There are no Masters here, just a...LOT of Servants.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> Many of these Servants are forced to fight tooth and nail just to secure one of the seven classes for themselves.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Wait. Servants are fighting each other for classes?</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> Sort of. Defective Servants are killing each other in an attempt to secure a proper class.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> Think of it as a sort of...selections stage preceding the actual battle itself.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...So it&#39;s a Holy Grail War with no Masters?</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> There have been rare cases of Rogue Servants, yes, but nothing like this.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> Here, every Servant is acting on their own, without a single Master among them.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> In fact, you&#39;re the very first Master I&#39;ve ever seen.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...Then, does that mean I&#39;m one of those Servants?</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t speak to that...</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> All I know is that you&#39;re the only Servant I&#39;ve seen here with a Master.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> What are you doing here with [\u2642 him /\u2640 her], anyway?</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...All I know is...when I came to, Master was there.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> I feel like I have to stay with [\u2642 him /\u2640 her], no matter what.</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong> Hey Ryouma, maybe she imprinted on [\u2642 him /\u2640 her]?</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong> You know, like when a baby bird thinks the first creature it sees is its mother?</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> Come now. Just because YOU did that doesn&#39;t mean\u2013</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...And that&#39;s my cue!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai! Are you all right!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Da Vinci!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Mash!</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong> What the hell? That scared Oryou.</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong> Hey, what kind of monster are you? A whatmon?</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> It looks like some of Master Fujimaru&#39;s friends have joined us. I&#39;m impressed they managed to slip through the Imperial Capital&#39;s quarantine...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Quarantine... Exactly!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> We&#39;re still figuring out how it happened, but what we do know...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...is that Fujimaru got trapped there during a Rayshift.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Normally, we don&#39;t have any issue tracking [\u2642 him /\u2640 her], but for some reason, it was tricky this time.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But being the unparalleled genius that I am, I was able to brute-force my way to reestablishing comms!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m just glad you&#39;re all right, Senpa\u2013Wait, what happened to your stomach!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m okay. It looks worse than it is.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I-I see...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I got...shot. Just a little though.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Are you sure you&#39;re all right!?</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong> Relax. A little spit and [\u2642 he&#39;ll /\u2640 she&#39;ll] be good as new.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Spit...!? Um, Senpai, can I ask who you are with?</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong> Oryou&#39;s Oryou. Just who the hell are you?</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> Yes, yes, just wait your turn, Oryou...</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> Let&#39;s try that again. It&#39;s a pleasure to make your acquaintance. I&#39;m Sakamoto Ryouma, a Rider.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> I take it you&#39;re Master Fujimaru&#39;s friends? You&#39;re affiliated with this Chaldea place [\u2642 he /\u2640 she] spoke of?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> So you&#39;re the ones who helped Fujimaru out. Thanks for that.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You seem like the sort of Servant with a good head on his shoulders.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> How about it, Fujimaru? Has that been your experience so far?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> He and Oryou did save me...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I definitely don&#39;t think he&#39;s a bad person.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Got it. If that&#39;s what you think, I&#39;m willing to give them a chance.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But I do want to make sure of one thing first. What are you hoping to get out of all this, Rider?</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> I suppose I should&#39;ve seen that question coming.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> ...Hmm. There&#39;s no sense lying about this, so I&#39;ll just be direct.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> I want to either retrieve or destroy the Holy Grail. I&#39;d even be happy to let Master Fujimaru have it if [\u2642 he /\u2640 she] wants.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hmm, and why is that? I don&#39;t see how an arrangement like that could possibly benefit you.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> You&#39;ve got me there... Someone else said something real similar to me a long time ago.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> All right, let me put it this way. The Holy Grail is the cause of a lot of suffering for the people here.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> I want to help them and put a stop to it. That&#39;s all.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You want to help them? That&#39;s it? You&#39;re really just going to say it flat out like that, in that lovely baritone voice of yours?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Heh... Hahahahaha! You really got me good! Talk about an emergency!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You don&#39;t have to laugh that much.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Come on Da Vinci, be nice.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Oh come on, you have to admit it&#39;s funny. I mean, this guy couldn&#39;t be more suspicious if he tried!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Still... Hmm, I suppose I will take you at your word. I do know Sakamoto Ryouma to be a Heroic Spirit who is certainly worthy of trust.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh? Why is that, Acting Director Da Vinci?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Oh, I took a gander at his file, and everything he&#39;s saying right now lines up with how he was in life.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> He&#39;s a very greedy person. He always sought wider recognition more than individual gratitude.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> People like that might talk a good game, but they don&#39;t lie. Don&#39;t you agree, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yeah, you may be right.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I do think he&#39;s a good person.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I, uh, I see...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> All right then, Rider, I&#39;m counting on you to take good care of Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> As for us, we&#39;re Chaldea, the Security Organization dedicated to the Preservation of Humanity.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You can think of us as Fujimaru&#39;s backup team, [\u2642 his /\u2640 her] operational support, if you like.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I am Leonardo da Vinci. Most people just call me Da Vinci, though!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> And I&#39;m Mash...Mash Kyrielight. I&#39;m one of Senpai&#39;s Servants.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...Hm.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So, you&#39;re...Sakamoto Ryouma.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Even though you&#39;re a master of the Hokushin Ittouryu, your greatest achievement did not involve drawing your sword...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...but in helping to negotiate the Satchou Alliance in an effort to restore imperial rule to Japan. You were a hero of the Meiji Restoration.</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong> Wow, Ryouma. Oryou didn&#39;t know you were so famous. Yaaay. Now we can have sekihan tomorrow too.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> Mmm. How kind of you.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> Let&#39;s see, Da Vinci, was it?</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> It seems you&#39;ve already gotten a good look at what&#39;s going on here in Tokyo, yes?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Righto. Honestly, this sorta stuff happens all the time, so it&#39;s not really anything new for us. But let me fill you in just in case.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That place you&#39;re in now? Tokyo is the only thing that exists there. Basically a self-contained island.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Only Tokyo?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What do you mean?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It&#39;s shut in by a series of invisible walls, which makes it impossible to get in or out using conventional means.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It&#39;s a bit like a Singularity in that it&#39;s quite separate from regular human history.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Then, nobody can escape from here?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Does that mean you can&#39;t intervene from the outside?</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> A Singularity, huh... Yeah, that sounds about right.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> ...You&#39;re spot-on.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> Nobody, whether human or Servant, is able to set one foot outside the Imperial Capital&#39;s limits.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> It&#39;s completely isolated, even from history itself.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Then, how is Senpai supposed to get back?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Oh, don&#39;t you worry about that, Mash.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The fact that we&#39;re able to communicate like this means there should also be a way to Rayshift [\u2642 him /\u2640 her] out of there.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Though we&#39;ll need a lot more information and a much more stable connection to improve our odds of success.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Fortunately, since I&#39;m such an amazing genius, I&#39;ve already mapped out the Singularity&#39;s structure.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Near as I can tell, it&#39;s erecting a Bounded Field around several different points to maintain the whole area&#39;s integrity.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I&#39;ve narrowed down a few points that seem like likely candidates, but I can&#39;t say anything for sure without seeing them for myself...</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> Not to worry. What you&#39;ve said has been a big help, believe it or not.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> I already planned to investigate this place myself anyway.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Sorry, the simulation we&#39;re using to observe you there just went kinda haywire.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It looks like somebody&#39;s jamming our signal. Whoever it is, they must have some kinda jerkwad engineer working for them.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It&#39;s going to take us a while to sort all this out, and we&#39;ll have to disconnect while we do it.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I&#39;m afraid this is all we can do for now. Let me send you the points to investigate before we go.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...All right, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> We&#39;ll keep an eye on things from here as best we can, but make sure you watch your own back too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, please be careful, Senpai!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> B-by the way, is that Okita there with you? She seems...kind of different...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I was too busy with my analysis to pay much attention, but now that you mention it, she DOES have a different air about her, doesn&#39;t she.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s not just the air. Her whole color palette is\u2013</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> Who was that...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Uh, that was Mash?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That was my really helpful kouhai.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...Hm.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...I see.</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong> What&#39;s wrong? You hungry or something?</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> ...You&#39;re more than a little clueless about some things, aren&#39;t you, Oryou.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> Anyway, we don&#39;t have any time to waste. I need to find out what the other Servants are up to.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> Since your wound still needs time to heal, can I ask you to stay here and watch the place while I&#39;m gone?</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong> He means weaklings should stay put. Sit... Stay! Good small fry.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Understood.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Small fry...?</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...I&#39;ll keep Master safe.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> Yes, please do. That will be a big help.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> Say, I have an idea. If you have the time, maybe you&#39;d like to help me a bit with my work?</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> Things have kind of piled up while I&#39;ve been away from the office, you see.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> I&#39;ll be happy to pay you, of course, and you wouldn&#39;t have to go far out of your way. Just handle whatever you&#39;re comfortable with. That should be fine.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> Since this area is a good ways away from the three Servants&#39; territories, it should be pretty safe.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Territories?</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> Ah, yes. It&#39;s a sort of additional rule specific to this Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> As long as a Servant with an official class is inside their own territory...</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> ...they receive special support from the Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...I don&#39;t have any support.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> That&#39;s why I specified they have to have an official class.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> Only once a Servant has won a battle for a class, and then been registered as that class...</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> ...will the Holy Grail begin to support them.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> You can&#39;t compete with other Servants over territory until you&#39;ve done that much.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Reminds me of that ink shooter that Archer and Hokusai play...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It reminds me of Risk or something.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> Essentially. All of the contestants are competing for territory.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> Incidentally, since I&#39;m a Rider, I have some leeway to ignore the other Servants&#39; territories and go where I please.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> Luckily for me, that&#39;s a handy thing to be able to do when you&#39;re conducting an investigation.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I see.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> I&#39;m glad you catch on so quickly. I&#39;ve never been part of a Holy Grail War quite like this either.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> There are still a lot of things I&#39;m unsure about, and the only way to find out more is to do the legwork.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Does that go for the Mini Nobus too?</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> You mean those strange creatures the Archer was commanding? It seems so, yes.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> The effect seems to differ depending on the Heroic Spirit and class, so in the end, it still comes down to investigating matters directly.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> All right then, I&#39;m going out for a while. Thanks for keeping an eye on my office in the meantime.</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong> Oryou will bring you back a frog.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Be careful out there.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Um, I&#39;m not really fond of frogs...</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> See you soon.</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong> Hey, Ryouma. Are you sure about them?</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> You mean the Master? I think we&#39;ll be fine. [\u2642 He /\u2640 She] seems like a perfectly nice person.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> I do consider myself a decent judge of character, you know. Plus, it seems like [\u2642 his /\u2640 her] friends are rather capable as well.</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong> No, Oryou meant to ask if those weaklings will be okay watching your office alone.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> ...I&#39;m shocked. I never thought you would ever worry about a human.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> Have you taken a liking to [\u2642 him /\u2640 her]?</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong> Yes. [\u2642 He /\u2640 She] looks yummy.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> Ah, I see...</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> Don&#39;t worry, they&#39;ll be fine. If I&#39;m right, then that Servant is...</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong> What? Does your stomach hurt?</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> No, no, I&#39;m fine.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ASakamoto Ryouma:</strong> Anyway, this certainly isn&#39;t the first time, but...</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ASakamoto Ryouma:</strong> ...it looks like this Holy Grail War is going to be quite a pain in the neck.</p><h2 id="section-3-man-slayer" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3-man-slayer" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 3: Man-Slayer</h2><p><strong>Rogue Servant:</strong> ...!?</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AMan in Black Coat:</strong> Hmph.

Early this morning, the Army&#39;s 4th Magecraft Unit announced...</p><p><strong>Radio Announcement:</strong> ...that a Holy Grail War has begun in the Imperial Capital, Tokyo.</p><p><strong>Radio Announcement:</strong> We repeat: a Holy Grail War has begun in Tokyo.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Huh, it&#39;s on the news?</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...Oh, normally it isn&#39;t? ...I see.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Do you like listening to the radio?</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...Yes. ...It&#39;s also good for learning words.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...For some reason, there are many things I don&#39;t know.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> Servants should have memories of their lives, but I do not.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> Okita Souji... Is that who I am?</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> And why am I missing the knowledge of this era that the Grail should have given me when I materialized?</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> I couldn&#39;t even speak until a little while ago...</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...What am I?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Alter...</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> I don&#39;t even know if I&#39;m a Saber. I think I&#39;m too weak for that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> At least you learned quickly, right?</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...Hm? Yes, I guess that&#39;s true.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> Maybe...I&#39;m actually smart?</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> By the way, Master, are you sure you&#39;re okay making a contract with a strange Servant like me?</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> I&#39;m not even sure if we sealed our contract properly...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m sure I can count on you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;m glad I met you.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...I see.

Just what I wanted to hear.</p><p><strong>Man in Black Coat:</strong> ...I am going to kill you now.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> What do you think you&#39;re doing?</p><p><strong>Man in Black Coat:</strong> What&#39;s this? Who are you? Why are you getting in my way?</p><p><strong>Man in Black Coat:</strong> Ah, the sword... I take it you are a Saber?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> An enemy Servant!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Alter! Are you okay!?</p><p><strong>Man in Black Coat:</strong> What nonsense.</p><p><strong>Man in Black Coat:</strong> Servants killing each other is the point of a Holy Grail War. Of course I&#39;d start by getting rid of the weaker ones.</p><p><strong>Man in Black Coat:</strong> And you ARE weak, aren&#39;t you, Saber? I could tell the moment we crossed blades.</p><p><strong>Man in Black Coat:</strong> Honestly, I can hardly believe you&#39;re a Saber with such pitiful skills.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Man in Black Coat:</strong> Haha!</p><p><strong>Man in Black Coat:</strong> So THIS is the Saber? One of the three strongest classes?

I guess I really am weak.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Let&#39;s get out of here!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You don&#39;t have to win.

Even if that wasn&#39;t quite what I was aiming for this time.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Mash!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Thank goodness you&#39;re all right, Senpai!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Thanks to Da Vinci&#39;s analysis, we&#39;ve figured out a way to bring you back.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...So!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Since the anchors holding that place together are made from Holy Grail fragments...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...all you have to do is destroy them, and that world&#39;s foundations should come crumbling down, taking the Singularity with them.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Even better, once that&#39;s done, the signals jamming our observations should disappear too...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...which will make Rayshifting Fujimaru back to Chaldea pretty simple.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Still... We have a goal, but actually making it happen is a bit more difficult.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> And then there&#39;s the whole twisting a Holy Grail War into some sort of Servant war game thing...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Why would anyone go to the trouble of setting up this Singularity to run on a system that is such a complete pain in the ass?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ASakamoto Ryouma:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> We&#39;ll keep an eye on that as we investigate.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> For now, Fujimaru, I&#39;d like you to focus mainly on destroying the anchors.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Aw crap, are we out of time already? Okay, one last quick thing.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You know the Servants&#39; territories? Well, they look like they&#39;re linked to the anchors too.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The more you whittle down enemy Servants&#39; territories the less assistance they&#39;ll get from the Grail.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> All right, looks like we&#39;re out of time, so, later!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, Senpai, about the tan Okita next to\u2013</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...She seems a little too friendly with you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You think?</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...Yes.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Mash and I have been through a lot together.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...I see. A lot, huh.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong> At any rate, now we know what our goal is.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong> We need to whittle down each Servant&#39;s territory and sever their connection to the Grail. Yeah, that&#39;s a lot more clear-cut.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong> Which means this is where we get serious. If we all work together, I&#39;m sure we can pull it off.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Got it! ...Uh, by the way...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Er... What about you, Assassin? What are you going to do?</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong> You will help us, right, Izo?</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> Are ya insane!?</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> Why would I ever help YOU lot!?</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> I&#39;m ONE of the Servants in this Holy Grail War, you know!</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong> I don&#39;t expect you to help for nothing, Izo.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong> Sure, you&#39;re a genius with the sword. But even you can&#39;t take them all on alone, can you?</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> Don&#39;t bother buttering me up! All you ever do is trick me into going along with you!</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong> ...Izo. You saw that enemy Saber for yourself, remember?</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong> She&#39;s tough. Really tough.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> ...You mean the one in the haori?</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> I&#39;d recognize that detestable blue haori anywhere... Ryouma, does that mean\u2013</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong> That&#39;s right. She&#39;s part of the strongest group of master swordsmen of the late Tokugawa shogunate...</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong> ...the group you and I have a long history with...</p><p><strong>Rogue Servant:</strong> ...!?</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> Hey, you...</p><p><strong>Rogue Servant:</strong> ...!?</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> Are you with Satsuma, or Choushu?</p><p><strong>Rogue Servant:</strong> ...!?!?</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> Well, I guess it doesn&#39;t matter.

Well, your Servant IS quite weak.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> This would have been a much longer fight if I hadn&#39;t been here.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...That may be true, but it&#39;s still mean of you to say. Anyway, are you sure about this, Master?</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> This Servant tried to kill Master.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong> It&#39;s okay. Izo at least takes his job seriously. I know he&#39;ll do great, just like he did for Mr. Katsu.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> It&#39;s not JUST my job I take seriously!</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> Relax. I&#39;m a man of my word.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> ...Unlike that lying Ryouma.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> How do you know Sakamoto, anyway?</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> ...We grew up in the same town. We used to play and go fishing together all the time.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You&#39;re nicer than I thought.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> Huh? Are you as thickheaded as he is? I&#39;m only helping you out for the time being!</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> Anyway, once this is over, I&#39;m just going to kill you all at once.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> ...This is it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So this is the Lancer&#39;s hideout...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> How did you know where it was?</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> I&#39;m an Assassin. This is kind of my thing, kid.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> Once I set my sights on someone, they don&#39;t get away.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> I see. So that&#39;s how you found us.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> ...Quiet.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> Something&#39;s not right... I can&#39;t sense the Lancer&#39;s presence anymore.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Are you sure?</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> Lancer was here just a moment ago, I&#39;m sure of it...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Did you maybe make a mistake?</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> I&#39;m divine punishment incarnate! I don&#39;t MAKE mistakes!</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> ...Aha. That explains it.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> It looks like someone got here before us.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> ...Come on. They&#39;re inside.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> ...Welcome, friend. Or, at least, welcome, visitor from the Far East.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> Then again, I only just got here myself, so maybe greetings aren&#39;t necessary.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> ...Did you kill the Lancer?</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> Kakaka, easy there!</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> This Holy Grail War has been rather dull, what with so few worthwhile opponents to fight.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> I was hoping these official Servants would be more of a challenge in their own territory, but as you can see, I was sadly mistaken.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> I was told that Holy Grail Wars were a fearsome clash between heroes old and new.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> So naturally, I was curious to pit my own skills against these great heroes.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> However, it seems that my reputation for killing in a single strike still rings true.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> What an incredible letdown it was when the battle really was over with a single strike.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You killed the Lancer here with one hit!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Izo, this Lancer&#39;s</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> ...Shut it.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> Hmph, I bet you&#39;re one of those dilettantes who only practices martial arts in the safety of their dojo. Awfully smut for a glorified athlete.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> I hate to bring you down while you are clearly riding high on your victories over so many weaklings...</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> ...but I&#39;m afraid now that I&#39;ve found you, your luck&#39;s run out.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> Prepare to be cut down where you stand!</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> Good, good. That&#39;s the sort of absurd boasting I had been hoping for. Now I need not hold back.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> So, which of you would like to face me first? Or I can also take you all on at once if you prefer.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> Huh? These two are only here to watch.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> I can handle a little spear-wielder like you without breaking a sweat.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> ...Now DIE!</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> Kaka, that&#39;s more like it!</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> I look forward to seeing what challenge, if any, your swordsmanship offers.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong> ...This is awful. All these beautiful flowers, snuffed out in their prime.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong> Even for a Berserker, this is horrific.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong> This park is supposed to be for everyone.</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong> It looks like he just went around killing anyone who happened to be close by. Even Oryou wouldn&#39;t make this much of a mess.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong> I don&#39;t know about that. You can get awfully messy. Anyway...how do we find the Berserker in question...</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> ...Hey, you.</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong> Ah. Ryouma, behind you.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> Hey, you... Are you with Satsuma, or Choushu?</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong> Oh, well then... It seems the Berserker found us.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong> Huh? Wait a moment... I know there&#39;s something wildly different about you, but aren&#39;t you...</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong> ...Well, well. It looks like Izo isn&#39;t the only blast from my past here.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> Answer me... Are you with Satsuma, or Choushu?</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> If you refuse to answer...</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> ...that will itself be answer enough...!</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong> I never thought I&#39;d run into the Demon Vice Commander of the Shinsengumi having a drink among the cherry blossoms here of all places.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong> Looks like you won&#39;t need to hold back, Oryou!</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> So you are my enemies. Just as I thought.</p><p><strong>Hijikata:</strong> ...This area belongs to the Shinsengumi. Nobody sets foot here and leaves alive!</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> ...I-impossible!</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> H-how can I be losing!?</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> ...How boring. You really are all bark and no bite.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> I can see where this is going. The best you can hope for is to die honorably now.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> Go ahead, come at me one more time. I can at least give you a quick death.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> ...This can&#39;t be happening!</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> My...my sword is invincible!</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> ...W-wait, of course! The territory!</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> You changed places with that Lancer you defeated, didn&#39;t you!</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> You can&#39;t fool me! I know how you Three Knight Classes get way more support from the Holy Grail than the rest of us!</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> Y-you&#39;re a coward, using cheap tricks like that!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Izo, it&#39;s...really not that in this case.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> This particular Lancer is just, well...</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...He&#39;s not using anything. ...He&#39;s just strong, plain and simple.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> ...What a shame. If only you didn&#39;t have such a short temper.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> You have enough natural talent that, with training, you could have really been something.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> C-COULD have been!?</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> My sword has never failed me!</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> Nobody could beat me! I could make any other style my own just be seeing it in action once!</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> I...I am a genius with the sword!</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> I know. You clearly have a gift for observation. You even surpass me in raw talent.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> Wha...!?</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> But that&#39;s all you have. A true martial artist must be skilled in many disciplines. Training only in one discipline is no path to supremacy.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> You should have disposed with such foolish notions while you were still young. Unfortunately, it seems fate was not kind to you.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> I can tell you must have died while you were still young and foolish. What a waste.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> What did you say...?</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> Enough talk now. I have sworn to take no more than one life per battle.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> This is as far as you go, Assassin, but I&#39;m willing to let the [\u2642 boy /\u2640 girl] live for now.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> After all, if I were to kill everyone every time, I&#39;d soon run out of prey with which to make my living.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I don&#39;t think so.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Stand back, Izo. Let&#39;s do this, Alter!</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...Got it.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> Are you mad!? How many times have I told you!? Even I was no match for him!</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> There&#39;s no way such a pathetically weak Servant as her could last more than a second!</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> ...I see. So you will be my true opponent.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> Very well then, yours will be the life I take in this battle.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...Master, this Servant is very strong.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> But I won&#39;t let him kill you. I promise.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m counting on you, Alter!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I know you won&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> Trust born from loyalty, hmm? Very well then. It&#39;s been some time since I killed a human!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...Guh!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Alter!</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> Hahahaha! This was quite an exciting match!</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> You were doomed from the start, but still you blocked my attacks no fewer than three times!</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> Pathetic swordsmanship indeed. You seem to lack confidence in your skills...but that is obviously not because you had it once and then lost it.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> No, I believe there is nothing wrong with you as you are now.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> That is why your last push was so powerful.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> ...The gods can be quite cruel. You have lost your destiny, and so remain ignorant. Yet from that ignorance came a flawless, techniqueless decisive blow.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> Your conviction was a sight to behold. You must care about that [\u2642 boy /\u2640 girl] a great deal.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...Lancer.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> ...Still, I may not have lost if I hadn&#39;t relaxed my guard. I suppose I&#39;m in no position to lecture.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> You there, subservient Assassin. I would say that my spear and your sword were a hairsbreadth apart.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> What...?</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> But even a hairsbreadth can be a world of distance.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> ...Why are you helping me?</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> You remind me of myself. I went around causing no end of trouble when I was young, too.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> Take it from this old man. If you want to progress, it&#39;s not too late to\u2013Ah, perhaps it is too late, since Servants don&#39;t grow or change?</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> Well, no matter. Even if what I tell you helps only in this conflict, it will still be of significance.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> Take this as a chance to work on your swordplay. Rebuild your skills from the ground up.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> Stop wasting time telling your opponents how much better than them you are. Instead simply demonstrate your superior strength and skill.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> The task is the same, of course. But changing your approach will change how you feel about it.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> Besides... It&#39;s fun to surpass one&#39;s own limits.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...You actually beat him.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> Yes... His skill with a spear was incredible. I&#39;m still not quite sure how I did it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Alter... You seem a lot stronger now.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...Am I? It&#39;s hard for me to tell.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...Now that I think of it, I feel like I&#39;m moving better after seeing that Saber fight.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> ...Hey. This is as far as we go together.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Izo.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...But</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...Wait. I hate to say it...</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...but your battle with that Lancer helped to weaken him.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> ...Shut up. We&#39;re not friends, or allies, or even friendly acquaintances.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> I had a job to do, and now it&#39;s done. We meet next as enemies, and I won&#39;t show you any mercy.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...</p><h2 id="section-6-agreement" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-6-agreement" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 6: Agreement</h2><p><strong>Major General Amami:</strong> ...So, the Lancer&#39;s territory is gone.

Boy, Sister, you don&#39;t play around when it comes to evil!</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong> ...If you call me that again, it will be the last thing you ever say.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong> Okay, why don&#39;t we go over our next moves?</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong> Now that the Lancer and Berserker are gone, that just leaves the Saber, Archer, and Caster.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong> I have a good idea where the Saber and Archer are thanks to Chaldea&#39;s data and my own investigation.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong> The Caster has built up and expanded his territory as well, though I still don&#39;t know where his base is.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong> And since members of that class are especially good at holing up in their own strongholds...</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong> ...I don&#39;t think there&#39;s much we can do about him until he makes a move.</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong> So we&#39;re back to the Saber and Archer again.</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong> Which do you two want to deal with? Of course, Oryou can take both if you&#39;re afraid.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...The Saber.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Alter...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Okita&#39;s gonna be a tough opponent.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> I feel like I NEED to see that Saber again, Master.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> I don&#39;t know why, but I can&#39;t shake the feeling.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong> Good point...</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong> If you really are another aspect of Okita, then you should see her again.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong> But, be careful.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong> Okita Souji was said to be the strongest of all the Shinsengumi...</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong> ...the group of swordsmen so fearsome that they had all of Kyoto quaking during the Tokugawa&#39;s final days.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yeah, I, uh...I know them.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;ve met swordsmen as amazing as Okita before...</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong> I was always wary of the Shinsengumi whenever I was in Kyoto. Just a hint of their pale blue haori was enough to make me turn around and go the other way.</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong> So Oryou just has to murder the Archer then.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong> That&#39;s a rather crude way to put it, but, yes, I suppose so.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> You two should be careful too. That Archer was frighteningly strong.</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong> Her? That dumb Archer&#39;s bullets aren&#39;t enough to even scratch Oryou.</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong> Just relax and let Oryou take care of her. This time, Oryou will even bring you back a frog.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Let&#39;s all look out for each other.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You really like frogs, don&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong> All right, let&#39;s do this thing. Wanna light a signal fire to mark the occasion?</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong> No, no. No need for that.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong> All right, good luck, you two.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong> ...And be warned, Okita really is strong.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Let&#39;s get going, Alter!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Let&#39;s go pay Okita a visit.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...Yes, Master.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> Let&#39;s go see this other me.</p><h2 id="section-7-memory" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-7-memory" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 7: Memory</h2><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> At least we didn&#39;t have any trouble getting here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...It&#39;s pretty quiet, huh.</p><p><strong>Okita Souji:</strong> So, you&#39;ve come...</p><p><strong>Okita Souji:</strong> Then let&#39;s get started.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> J-just like that!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You ARE Okita, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Okita Souji:</strong> For an enemy, you&#39;re awfully familiar with me.</p><p><strong>Okita Souji:</strong> But even if you do know who I am, this is a Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Okita Souji:</strong> It&#39;d be absurd to think the Okita Souji you know and the one standing before you are the same.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...I want to ask you something. ...Am I you?</p><p><strong>Okita Souji:</strong> That&#39;s hard to say.</p><p><strong>Okita Souji:</strong> I certainly never had a sword quite that...huge.</p><p><strong>Okita Souji:</strong> ...But, as I said, this is a Holy Grail War. Maybe these sorts of things just happen.</p><p><strong>Okita Souji:</strong> ... That&#39;s strange...</p><p><strong>Okita Souji:</strong> I&#39;m not usually so chatty before a duel.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> I get the same feeling.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...So let&#39;s just find out in battle.</p><p><strong>Okita Souji:</strong> Very well...</p><p><strong>Okita Souji:</strong> ...There is no right or wrong on the battlefield. There is only kill, or be killed.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...Let&#39;s do this!</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong> Rider, huh... I&#39;m impressed you plowed through my army so easily.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> Nothing easy about it. Those weird little things are surprisingly tough.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> Is it your territory that lets you make them?</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> ...Lady Oda Nobunaga. The Demon King of the Sixth Heaven.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> Facing you in person, I can see exactly why you dominated the Warring States period.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong> Hmph. Spare me your hollow flattery.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong> What is it you want, Rider?</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong> Depending on what it is, it may not be necessary for us to fight.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> If only that were the case.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> But I&#39;m afraid what I want is your head, Lady Nobunaga. Figuratively speaking.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong> My head?</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> That&#39;s right. I&#39;ve been investigating for a while, and everything I&#39;ve found points to you being the key to this Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong> Hmm... Does this mean you&#39;re forfeiting the war too, Rider?</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong> Are you giving up on your wish for the Holy Grail?</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> Well, as it turns out...the real Rider is long gone by now.</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong> Oryou got rid of him.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong> ...What?</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> I was never truly part of this Holy Grail War to begin with.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> ...I&#39;m only here because the world itself called to me.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong> What? Then, you mean you&#39;re part of the Counter Force...?</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong> Wahahahaha! This is great! I&#39;ve made an enemy of the world itself!</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> Anyway, that&#39;s where things stand.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong> Then I suppose we do have to fight.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong> Fine then. Once I defeat you, I&#39;ll be able to widen my sphere of influence even further.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> ...Let&#39;s do this, Oryou! I&#39;m going to use my Noble Phantasm!</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong> Don&#39;t worry. Oryou will snap a little twig like this in no time.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong> So, you&#39;ve chosen to go on the offensive right out of the gate.</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> Orochi of the earth, sealed by the Amasakahoko...</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong> Oho. I knew it. That woman&#39;s your Noble Phantasm!</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> Here I come, Demon King of the Sixth Heaven!</p><p><strong>Sakamoto Ryouma:</strong> Like a Dragon Soaring Through the Heavens... Amakakeru Ryu ga Gotoku!</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong> Ha! A dragon, eh. Fascinating!</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong> But nothing can withstand my Three Line Formation!</p><p><strong>Okita Souji:</strong> A swordsman&#39;s blade must be swift and sharp!</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...Wha!?</p><p><strong>Okita Souji:</strong> ...Too slow!</p><p><strong>Okita Souji:</strong> Don&#39;t just step in with your feet!</p><p><strong>Okita Souji:</strong> You need to call upon all your own strength to face your opponent!</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...What the?</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> ...There&#39;s nothing that can be done for this baby. She was probably born too prematurely.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> Her skin&#39;s dirt brown, and she&#39;s barely even breathing.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A???:</strong> Please... Isn&#39;t there anything you can do?</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> Forget her, Mitsu. She&#39;ll be lucky if she lasts even a day or two.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> At this point, all you can do is pray to the Buddha.</p><p><strong>Okita Souji:</strong> You&#39;re swinging your sword from your wrist! The power should come from your waist!</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...Ghh! I...!</p><p><strong>Mitsu:</strong> ...Please, Buddha! I beg of you. Please, save Soujirou.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mitsu:</strong> Please... I beg you. I just know they&#39;ll grow up to do good as long as there&#39;s a chance...</p><p><strong>Mitsu:</strong> Please, save Soujirou.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...Very well.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> At one point in that child&#39;s life...</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...she will form a pact with me, just once.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> When she does, I shall take her body from the world.</p><p><strong>Okita Souji:</strong> ...Are you an idiot or something!?</p><p><strong>Okita Souji:</strong> Our swords may look different, but they&#39;re supposed to be used identically!</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> I know that! Just a little more, and I&#39;ll catch up!</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...Now I see. I&#39;m a manifestation of the Counter Force that was brought here to repay this debt...</p><p><strong>Okita Souji:</strong> ...What!? How are you matching my speed with such a huge blade!?</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...There. I caught up.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...And I remember now. I was right. I am you.</p><p><strong>Okita Souji:</strong> ...It&#39;s too soon to say that for sure. This duel isn&#39;t over yet.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;ve been fighting for a while...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Endurance matches aren&#39;t your strong suit, Okita!</p><p><strong>Okita Souji:</strong> I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re expecting, but if you&#39;re waiting for my magical energy to run out, don&#39;t bother.</p><p><strong>Okita Souji:</strong> As long as I&#39;m in my territory, that will never happen.</p><p><strong>Okita Souji:</strong> Not even the cursed disease that plagues my body can slow me down here.</p><p><strong>Okita Souji:</strong> That...is the power my territory gives me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> R-really...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Then, that would make you Perfect Okita!</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> Good. That is how it should be. I need to reclaim my identity!</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> Come on! I&#39;ll end this with my next strike!</p><p><strong>Okita Souji:</strong> All right... In that case, I&#39;ll fight you with everything I&#39;ve got.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AOkita Souji:</strong> I am Okita Souji, Captain of the Shinsengumi&#39;s First Unit!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AOkita Souji:</strong> ...Prepare to face the power of my secret technique!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Okita Souji:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Okita Souji:</strong> Good grief. It&#39;s so strange, having another me around.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...You could have cut me down at any time. Why didn&#39;t you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Okita... Were you...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Were you trying to train Alter?</p><p><strong>Okita Souji:</strong> I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.</p><p><strong>Okita Souji:</strong> I&#39;m just a man-slayer summoned by the Holy Grail. All I&#39;ve done here is kill people left and right.</p><p><strong>Okita Souji:</strong> Nothing has changed. I cut down my enemies when I was alive, and I&#39;ve done the same as a Servant. It was enough to make me forget why I was alive at all.</p><p><strong>Okita Souji:</strong> ...That&#39;s why I ended up pawning my debt off onto you.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Okita Souji:</strong> ...Here. Take this with you.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AOkita Alter:</strong> This is...your Noble Phantasm...?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AOkita Souji:</strong> You have someone of your own to protect.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AOkita Souji:</strong> I failed to do that when I was still alive. Maybe I should have found a way, but I didn&#39;t.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AOkita Alter:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AOkita Souji:</strong> You&#39;re the person I should have been. Now, it&#39;s time for me to say goodbye.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AOkita Souji:</strong> And, please...apologize to the Buddha for me. Tell him I&#39;m sorry I ended up living only for myself.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AOkita Souji:</strong> ...As for you.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AOkita Souji:</strong> I hope you can watch over this other me...at least until her time comes.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Okita...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Alter... What was Okita talking about...?</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AOkita Alter:</strong> ...I remember now what it is I must do, Master.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AOkita Alter:</strong> Let&#39;s go back. The time is nearly at hand.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AOkita Alter:</strong> ...It&#39;s time...for all this to end.</p><h2 id="section-8-tenkai" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-8-tenkai" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 8: Tenkai</h2><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong> ...I never thought I&#39;d have to unleash my killer demon like this.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong> Your Noble Phantasm really is like a dragon soaring through the heavens...</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong> But...that&#39;s also why it won&#39;t work on me.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong> I can&#39;t believe it...

Now that I&#39;ve faced you directly, there&#39;s one thing I know for sure.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong> ...As I suspected, you aren&#39;t yourself, Lady Nobunaga.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong> What was that? What do you mean, Rider?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ARyouma:</strong> ...So now, my work here is done. From here on, someone else will have to...handle this...</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong> I&#39;m...not myself...?</p><p><strong>Major General Amami:</strong> Well done, Lady Nobunaga. I knew you would stand head and shoulders above the rest of this rabble of Heroic Spirits.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong> ...Who are you?</p><p><strong>Major General Amami:</strong> Who am I? What a cruel thing to say. We just signed a treaty mere hours ago, remember?</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong> So you&#39;re the Caster. Now I see. With Rider dead, and the tide of this war turning in my favor...</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong> ...you realized you were nearly out of time to ambush me, and hurried here before missing your opportunity.</p><p><strong>Major General Amami:</strong> Yes, I am a Caster. My True Name is Nankoubou Tenkai. It was my idea to build this Imperial Capital with the goal of keeping the Tokugawa dynasty safe.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong> So you&#39;re Takechiyo&#39;s man...? Hmph, never heard of you.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong> Well, no matter. This saves me the trouble of hunting you down.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1ANankoubou Tenkai:</strong> Now, now, Lady Nobunaga, are you quite certain you don&#39;t remember me? Perhaps it would help if I took off these sunglasses.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong> ...You!?</p><p><strong>Nankoubou Tenkai:</strong> It&#39;s been a long time, my lord...Lady Oda Kazusa-no-Suke Nobunaga!</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong> ...What&#39;s the meaning of this? What are you even doing here!?</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong> ...!?</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong> What the...!?</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong> ...I can&#39;t move!</p><p><strong>Nankoubou Tenkai:</strong> I already have you in the palm of my hand, Lady Nobunaga. Just like back at Honnoji!</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong> ...Ah, now I see. \u201CNankoubou Tenkai\u201D was just a cover... And you rule this land...?</p><p><strong>Nankoubou Tenkai:</strong> I knew you would catch on quickly, Lady Nobunaga. Indeed, this entire Imperial Capital is my territory.</p><p><strong>Nankoubou Tenkai:</strong> Compared to the power I have amassed, the fights among you other Servants have just been little scuffles and brawls.</p><p><strong>Nankoubou Tenkai:</strong> With each Holy Grail War, my territory collects new Spirit Origins...</p><p><strong>Nankoubou Tenkai:</strong> This is my territory...</p><p><strong>Nankoubou Tenkai:</strong> ...The Imperial Capital of the gods!</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong> ...So this entire Imperial Capital is your territory, huh!?</p><p><strong>Nankoubou Tenkai:</strong> I have waited a long time for this day. A very...very long time.</p><p><strong>Nankoubou Tenkai:</strong> This is why I fled from that man, curried favor with the Tokugawa family, and have been biding my time for three centuries.</p><p><strong>Nankoubou Tenkai:</strong> Now, at last, the true Lady Nobunaga will return!</p><p><strong>Oda Nobunaga:</strong> ...Mitsuhideee! You bastard!</p><p><strong>Nankoubou Tenkai:</strong> ...Good. Take her away.</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> Yes, sir!</p><p><strong>Nankoubou Tenkai:</strong> Now, I have the Holy Grail, Lady Nobunaga&#39;s Spirit Origin, and the souls of the countless Heroic Spirits that have come to this land.</p><p><strong>Nankoubou Tenkai:</strong> At last, my wish will be granted!</p><p><strong>Nankoubou Tenkai:</strong> Hehehe...

You&#39;re scaring them.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobukatsu?:</strong> Right, right, sorry. It&#39;s just that your body is so suffocating it&#39;s hard to get comfortable in here.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AOda Nobukatsu:</strong> Well, what do you expect? We&#39;re two different people sharing the same Spirit Origin.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What are you... WHAT?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> So, you&#39;re Nobukatsu and Nobbu?</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...What is this person, Master?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AOda Nobukatsu:</strong> Long time no see! You&#39;re my sister&#39;s\u2013</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AOda Nobukatsu?:</strong> Shut it, Nobukatsu. I&#39;ll do the talking.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AOda Nobukatsu?:</strong> Oh, hey Okita, I didn&#39;t know you were here too. You look different though... Did you do something with your hair?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AOda Nobukatsu?:</strong> ...And your...skin?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Nobbu? Is that you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Yeeeah... Now it feels like GUDAGUDA...</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AOda Nobukatsu?:</strong> Well, you could say that, and you could also NOT say that.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AOda Nobukatsu?:</strong> Look, just hear me out.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):</strong> Basically, Fujimaru...</p><p><strong>Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):</strong> ...the Holy Grail summoned both me and you here at the same time.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):</strong> Well, more like it tied me down to it, really.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Tied you down to it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Then, did that happen to Okita too?</p><p><strong>Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):</strong> Yep. Normally, my Spirit Origin would&#39;ve been made into the Holy Grail&#39;s Servant...</p><p><strong>Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):</strong> ...and I would&#39;ve been forced to do its bidding.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):</strong> But right before I was Servantized, I cut off a bit of my Spirit Origin to prevent that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I didn&#39;t know that was a thing you could do.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Yikes...</p><p><strong>Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):</strong> Usually that sort of thing would be impossible.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):</strong> But after everything that transpired last time, Nobukatsu happened to be inscribed near my own Spirit Origin.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):</strong> I therefore rented out a bit of space in his Spirit Origin so I could manifest, too!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AOda Nobukatsu:</strong> Usually, my Spirit Origin would be too weak to materialize at all...</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AOda Nobukatsu:</strong> ...but I managed to pull it off after adding Sister&#39;s to my own.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):</strong> Still, this was an all-star team technique. It only worked because Nobukatsu and I are actual siblings.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):</strong> That said, this Spirit Origin is a little small for me, so it&#39;s kind of cramped in here. Can&#39;t do anything about that, though!</p><p><strong>Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):</strong> Anyway, I&#39;ve been here biding my time seeing how things would play out ever since.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Are you kidding me? What kind of plot twist is that?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Long time no see, Senpai!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So, about that Okita who isn&#39;t like Oki\u2013</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Sorry Mash, but this is urgent.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I am intrigued by the idea of housing two personalities in one Spirit Origin...but, yes, this is definitely more important.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I figured out the structure of that Singularity...or rather, why it was made in the first place.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Listen closely. That entire area is designed to collect Servants and produce pure Spirit Origins.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It&#39;s more like a magical circuit used for magecraft rituals than anything else.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It collects Servants?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Pure Spirit Origins?</p><p><strong>Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):</strong> Now I see... It&#39;s a kodoku.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AOda Nobukatsu:</strong> You know about it, Sister!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hmm, interesting. A kodoku is old Eastern magecraft that involves filling a pot with venomous snakes or insects and having them kill each other.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The mage then uses the fluids of the one creature that survived to cast a curse. What an excellent analogy.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):</strong> Basically, whoever&#39;s behind this is having Servants kill each other to get their hands on extremely pure Spirit Origins.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):</strong> That&#39;s why they needed a Holy Grail War with so many different Servants fighting each other.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> And if that wasn&#39;t bad enough, from what we&#39;ve observed, they&#39;ve actually conducted a great many Holy Grail Wars there.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> How many is a great many?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> For a long time now?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I can&#39;t say for sure, but I&#39;m pretty sure that since the whole place was carved out of history...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...it&#39;s been host to Holy Grail War after Holy Grail War in order to keep collecting Spirit Origins.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Even if he IS taking advantage of the Holy Grail&#39;s power...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...the sheer planning, preparation, and time it would take to pull that off is insane.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):</strong> ...Maybe, but I wouldn&#39;t put it past that kumquat.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Kumquat?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Isn&#39;t that your</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Now that he&#39;s come this far, that Caster must be planning something pretty outrageous.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong> ...Now I see. So that&#39;s how we ended up out here.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...Rider. I see you&#39;re all right.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong> Yup! Thanks to Lady Nobunaga&#39;s...kid brother?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What a relief...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Where&#39;s Oryou?</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong> Sorry. Oryou&#39;s still trying to live the whole thing down.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong> Oryou&#39;s actually my Noble Phantasm, you see. Once I was back up to snuff, she was able to maintain her form again.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong> Things don&#39;t usually go this well, but it looks like these are special circumstances.</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong> All that posturing you did when we said goodbye, and now look at us. This is so embarrassing. Oryou wishes she could just crawl into a water hole and die.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):</strong> Well, I can&#39;t exactly take advantage of my power in Nobukatsu&#39;s body anyway. Rider may be an especially weak Heroic Spirit, but he&#39;s better than nothing.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong> Haha, you&#39;ve got me there.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong> Still, I&#39;m hardly the only one. Compared to you, Lady Nobunaga, almost every Heroic Spirit here is third-rate at best.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> All the same, we still have to do something about the Caster&#39;s plot...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...or Fujimaru will never be able to get back home.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):</strong> Then there&#39;s only one thing to do.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):</strong> We grind that kumquat\u2013I mean, Caster&#39;s plans into the dirt...</p><p><strong>Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):</strong> ...and go back to Chaldea like the badasses we are.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> True.

I&#39;m coming too.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Izo? Is that you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Do I know you?</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong> Izo... That&#39;s the outfit you wore during\u2013</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> I&#39;m not doing this for you. I just don&#39;t like being anyone&#39;s pawn.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> I don&#39;t know who this Caster thinks he is, but nobody pulls my strings and gets away with it.</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong> Come on, Ryouma, we don&#39;t need him, do we?</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong> ...We can absolutely use him. Izo is worth a hundred ordinary soldiers.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> ...Hmph. So, do you know where this Caster is?</p><p><strong>Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):</strong> I&#39;ve got a decent idea, but I don&#39;t have his exact whereabouts just yet. But you can fix that, can&#39;t you, Assassin?</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> You bet. If there&#39;s a Servant in their territory, I can find them no problem.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...Let&#39;s go, Master. I have a feeling this is why I&#39;m here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> All right, let&#39;s go!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Alter...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Please take good care of Senpai, Alter!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Phew!

Overwhelm them with sheer numbers!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1ANobukatsu (with Nobbu):</strong> How can there be this many of them!? It&#39;s too narrow here for so many! This is just like Okehazama!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1ANobukatsu (with Nobbu):</strong> And what the hell are Heroic Spirit Soldiers, anyway!?</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong> They&#39;re artificial soldiers made from the Spirit Origins they&#39;ve collected from Heroic Spirits.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong> In Western terms, they&#39;re basically golems.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong> Of course, they can&#39;t hold a candle to Servants individually, but there are enough of them that they don&#39;t really need to.</p><p><strong>Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu):</strong> Grr, if I only had my own body, I could wipe these things out in an instant! Argh, this is so frustrating!</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...We&#39;ll never get anywhere like this.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong> Looks like we&#39;ll have to handle this ourselves.

My wounds are all healed, and I&#39;ve got Oryou AND Izo with me.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong> How about it, Izo? Would you mind helping me out again?</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> I never agreed to that! I&#39;m only here to cut down that Caster!</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> If you&#39;re just stalling for time, Ryouma, then do it yourself!</p><p><strong>Oryou:</strong> You&#39;re only good for taking out weaklings anyway. Trim their numbers before you die so Oryou can finish the job.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> What was that? You want to die first, snake-woman?</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong> Ahahaha... Please, Izo? I could really use your help.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> ...?</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> Ryouma...</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> Tch, fine!

Oryou can&#39;t believe the stupid weak Assassin saw through us. That is going to be a painful memory for the rest of Oryou&#39;s life.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong> Well, I have been pushing too hard for a while now...

What are you lot doing here? I don&#39;t see Rider with you...</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> So you&#39;re the Caster.</p><p><strong>Nankoubou Tenkai:</strong> ...How odd.

You&#39;re too late.</p><p><strong>Nankoubou Tenkai:</strong> Take a look.

I was the only one who ever understood her!</p><p><strong>Nankoubou Tenkai:</strong> I had to be the only one who understood her!</p><p><strong>Nankoubou Tenkai:</strong> She had no right to go around sharing her dreams of world domination with anyone but me!</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...This man...</p><p><strong>Akechi Mitsuhide:</strong> ...So I killed her.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...How could you do that?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...You&#39;re mad.</p><p><strong>Akechi Mitsuhide:</strong> I had no other choice, Lady Nobunaga.

None but Lady Nobunaga can ever rule Japan!</p><p><strong>Akechi Mitsuhide:</strong> Yes! Lady Nobunaga! MY Lady Nobunaga! Now, hear me, Holy Grail! Hear me, Heroic Spirits!</p><p><strong>Akechi Mitsuhide:</strong> Bring forth Lady Nobunaga...MY Lady Nobunaga...!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AOda Nobunaga:</strong> Ugh... How dull.</p><p><strong>Akechi Mitsuhide:</strong> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AOda Nobunaga:</strong> You bore me, Kumquat...</p><p><strong>Akechi Mitsuhide:</strong> Who are you...?</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AOda Nobunaga:</strong> Don&#39;t get me wrong, your scheme isn&#39;t terrible.

He thought only of a world in which he was dominant.</p><p><strong>Akechi Mitsuhide:</strong> Shut up...</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AOda Nobunaga:</strong> You didn&#39;t lose to him.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AOda Nobunaga:</strong> You lost to your own fears.</p><p><strong>Akechi Mitsuhide:</strong> Shut up...!</p><p><strong>Akechi Mitsuhide:</strong> What would you know of Lady Nobunaga!?</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AOda Nobukatsu:</strong> Um, can I say something too, Sister?</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AOda Nobukatsu:</strong> Honestly, after hearing all that, I&#39;m kind of ticked off!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AOda Nobukatsu:</strong> I don&#39;t know who this guy is...</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AOda Nobukatsu:</strong> ...but no one understands you better than I do!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Uh...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Should&#39;ve seen that coming.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AOda Nobunaga:</strong> Don&#39;t interrupt me, you idiot!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AOda Nobunaga:</strong> At any rate, you don&#39;t get to use my body.

I think that&#39;s what that Saber would have done.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> We&#39;ll just have to take these Heroic Spirit Soldiers out!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Oh, yeah, good point.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...Okay, Master, let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> ...Well?

Oryou can&#39;t move anymore.</p><p><strong>Officer:</strong> ...Even if they are just delaying the inevitable, I can&#39;t believe how many Heroic Spirit Soldiers these three defeated...</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> Dammit, this ALWAYS happens whenever I let you sweet talk me into something! I KNEW I should&#39;ve gone and killed the Caster myself.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong> Haha... Sorry, Izo.</p><p><strong>Officer:</strong> ...Kill them.</p><p><strong>Heroic Spirit Soldier:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> ...I can&#39;t even lift my arms anymore.

You are powerful, but you don&#39;t seem to be any of the normal Servant classes.</p><p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> Who are you?</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...I am another aspect of Okita Souji. I am her Alter Ego.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> And I have come here to defeat you.</p><p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> An Alter Ego...? What is that? That class doesn&#39;t exist in Holy Grail Wars.</p><p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> Hmm... At first I thought he might have sent you, but that seems extremely unlikely now.</p><p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> Well, no matter. You&#39;ll die as easily as the rest of the rabble.</p><p><strong>Heroic Spirit Soldier:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> ...Well this sucks. I didn&#39;t expect you to be this weak.

Who would have thought.</p><p><strong>Ryouma:</strong> I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen any Heroic Spirit with such incredible willpower.

Chacha is Avenger Yodo, the empress of Toyotomi who burns with fiery vengeance!</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...Master, I know this situation seems like a joke that&#39;s gone too far, but she is seriously powerful! I think she may have reached a point where the Counter Force needs to get involved.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...Then, wait... Does that mean that the whole reason I am here is for this moment!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yeah, I reeeally don&#39;t think so.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I think the Counter Force is better than that.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> Yes, I suppose you&#39;re right. If that were the case, I&#39;d have to disappear all over again.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> Thank you, slightly-stronger-than-average person.</p><p><strong>Avenger Yodo:</strong> Why does Cha\u2013Avenger Yodo get the feeling you&#39;re not taking me seriously!?</p><p><strong>Avenger Yodo:</strong> All right, that does it. Now that it&#39;s come to this, I&#39;ll show you just how powerful I&#39;ve become.</p><p><strong>Avenger Yodo:</strong> Taste the power I gained from the unyielding fury that turned me into an Avenger when I learned that you had finished the WHOLE event without me!</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> Wha...!? I thought I&#39;d destroyed that!</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong> Why is there a Holy Grail in Chacha!?</p><p><strong>Avenger Yodo:</strong> Heh... I found it lying around when I got here!</p><p><strong>Avenger Yodo:</strong> After I&#39;d finished eating ice cream out of it, I felt incredible power surging through me...power to change the whole world! Or...something...</p><p><strong>Avenger Yodo:</strong> Now, nobody can stop me! Soon, Tokugawa&#39;s infernal city will be little more than dust!</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong> Dammit! I guess we have to fight! Come on, Alter Me!</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> Got it, Normal Me! If two Okitas join forces, we can unleash limitless Okita Power. Now...</p><p><strong>Double Okita:</strong> ...witness the power of Double Okita!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong> ...Nghhh, Auntie, that&#39;s Chacha&#39;s coffee... ...Yaaawn... (Zzz)</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> Hehe... She&#39;s sleepy. She looks so peaceful.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That was a hell of a fight, huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That Double Sandanzuki was pretty sweet.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> Indeed. I could never have won without your Command Spells and Normalkita laying down her own life.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> From now on, I&#39;ll need to work hard enough for the both of us in order to support you, Master...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Alter...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> If only Okita hadn&#39;t pushed herself so hard...</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong> Whoa, whoa, whoa! I&#39;m not dead! I just fainted a little! That&#39;s all!</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong> Don&#39;t go getting all weepy on me now!</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> You certainly have it hard, don&#39;t you, Normalkita? I can&#39;t imagine what it&#39;s like myself.</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong> Huh!? But not even the Holy Grail can cure this curse!? Why do you get off scot-free when we&#39;re both Okita!?</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong></p><p>...Ah! Huh?</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong> What&#39;s Chacha doing here...? Oh, hi, Master. Hi, Okita. Hi, Okita. What&#39;s going on?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> We were all just about to go home together.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It...uh, it&#39;s a long story.</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong> I see... Chacha didn&#39;t know Chacha did that... Chacha&#39;s sorry for all the trouble, Okita, um, Alter, right?</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> Don&#39;t worry about it.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> Besides, I was born just a short while ago. All of this stuff is very exciting to me.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> It&#39;s a wonderful feeling, being alive.</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong> Born recently... Is that so... Hmm... Maybe I did get a little carried away.</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong> Maybe we can start over? It&#39;s nice meeting you, Alterwhatsit.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...How strange. Hearing someone as small as you call me that is...oddly calming.</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong> Hehe, is that so? Well, you can think of Chacha as your mother! Ask me for anything!</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong> And make sure you bring Chacha ice cream on Mother&#39;s Day!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> There, I finally got through! Are you all right, Senpai!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yeah, more or less.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Can we just have dinner now, please?</p><p><strong>Nobbu:</strong> Good, it looks like Chacha&#39;s back to normal. Well done, Master.</p><p><strong>Nobbu:</strong> Now hurry back before supper gets cold.</p><p><strong>Nobbu:</strong> I really must say, though...this pudding I found in the fridge while you were out sure is tasty! (Smacking lips)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ah! Nobunaga, that&#39;s Chacha&#39;s\u2013</p><p><strong>Chacha:</strong> ...Pudding you found in the fridge?</p><p><strong>Nobbu:</strong> Mm! The oden we&#39;re having for supper is especially tasty, too! (Munch munch) I always did love strong flavors! Wahahaha! I can&#39;t put it down!</p><p><strong>Nobbu:</strong> What? Is this all we had? Oh, sorry. I guess I ate it all for a snack while I was waiting for you guys.</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> ...Oden?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;ll buy more oden and pudding, okay!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Oh no...</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AAvenger Yodo:</strong> DEATH TO AUNTIE! NO MERCY!</p><p><strong>Okita Alter:</strong> This...is the power of the Counter Force...!</p><p><strong>Nobbu:</strong> ...Huh? What&#39;s the matter with you two? Doesn&#39;t this seem weird to anyone else?</p><p><strong>Okita:</strong> (Sigh) Here we go again...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yep, that&#39;s GUDAGUDA...</p><p><strong>Nobbu:</strong> W-wait! It couldn&#39;t be heeelped!</p>',2340),s=[a];function i(g,h){return o(),e("div",null,s)}var u=t(n,[["render",i],["__file","gudaguda3.html.vue"]]);export{u as default};
