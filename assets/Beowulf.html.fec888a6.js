The answer&#39;s simple.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So\u2013you think it&#39;s Grendel?</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> No doubt. I can&#39;t think of anything besides him that could influence the summoning process.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> It&#39;s true there are nameless fire dragons out there...</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> But Grendel was the only monster with such fierce hate and glory in my life.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> He was an evil creature who played with people&#39;s lives.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> The kind of evil that reveled in the meaningless slaughter of people trapped in their dwellings.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> I can understand fights over territory, or animals just fighting for survival.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> But\u2013Grendel had both reason and intellect and was simply evil.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> That&#39;s why his very existence... is far more of a threat to me than that of a fire dragon.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> Fire dragons are passive as long as you leave their treasure alone. But Grendel&#39;s a twisted monster who revels in evil.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> If he revived as a side-effect of my summoning\u2013 I gotta kill him.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Then let&#39;s go. The last response was in the old castle up ahead.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> If you take a look at it, maybe you&#39;ll figure something out.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> Okay. Let&#39;s go, Master.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> There are some things that shouldn&#39;t exist in this world. Grendel is one of them.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s\u2013deserted. Not a soul to be seen.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> I can smell blood. It seems we missed our chance.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ugh...</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> Mash, can you tell? Looks like every last human in this castle was slaughtered.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> ...Damn. This isn&#39;t good.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> The more human flesh he consumes, the more powerful and evil he gets. We have to crush him before he attains his perfect form.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But, where is he\u2013?</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> Something&#39;s close! Mash, prepare for battle!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s coming!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> Damn... We didn&#39;t take it down!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> W-Was that a chimera?</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> Grendel is a protean creature. He can change his form depending on the situation.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> That&#39;s why I need Hrunting, because it tracks enemies.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> Let&#39;s go after him. Follow me!</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> So, here...</p><p><strong>Soldier A:</strong> H-Help me...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That...</p><p><strong>Soldier A:</strong> Help me...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Wait, now!</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> Stop!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> !?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Wh-Why\u2013!?</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> ...Enough of this stupid farce, Grendel. Hrunting is eager to bite into you.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What, a fake\u2013?</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> Something like that! Let&#39;s go, Master. It&#39;s not a human, so don&#39;t hold back!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> He ran away again. Listen up, young lady. Don&#39;t trust whoever it is you next meet in this castle.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> Also, don&#39;t be surprised by who you run into. He can read your mind like a book.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> When he appears again, he&#39;ll likely take the form of someone we know.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> Brace yourself, it&#39;s gonna be painful.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> Just a little more... Hey, come on out already!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Drake:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...T-These are all fakes!?</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> Right. What looks like armor and clothes is hardened skin. The weapons are extensions of claws and hair.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> Pretty nasty, right? That&#39;s why he&#39;s evil.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> But luckily it looks like we can kill him before he starts talking to us.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> He talks?</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> Only based on the speech in the memories he extracts.</p><p><strong>Grendel:</strong> ...N-No. I&#39;m just...not...used...to this body yet.</p><p><strong>Grendel:</strong> I don&#39;t know...why I was...summoned. But...I&#39;ll do what...I have to.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What on earth...</p><p><strong>Grendel:</strong> I&#39;ll kill you...in a cruel way. Every last one...in cold blood.</p><p><strong>Grendel:</strong> That&#39;s how it is. That&#39;s how it must be.</p><p><strong>Grendel:</strong> That&#39;s what makes me Grendel. Like how I feasted on the human souls back in that castle!</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> Shut up. You probably just heard that from your mom. I&#39;ll make sure the two of you are nice and cozy together in hell.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> Master, let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Grendel:</strong> D-Damn you!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ugh... I feel queasy... I know they&#39;re fakes, but the sensation when you hit them...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But it&#39;s all over now, right? There&#39;s no response. Let&#39;s head back.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> ... ...Master, don&#39;t you think something&#39;s off?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I don&#39;t know.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> I see...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Yeah, vaguely.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> You&#39;ve got a sharp nose. That&#39;s my Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What do you mean?</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> It&#39;s a vicious creature we&#39;re dealing with. Not the sort to accept death without a struggle.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> ...Something smells. Can we search a little longer?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Okay... If you think it&#39;s a good idea, there&#39;s no problem.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> He&#39;s nowhere to be found...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> ...Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Fou?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fou, fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Below us?</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> Oh, damn, I didn&#39;t notice. This castle has a cellar. Let&#39;s check it out.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I can&#39;t believe the cellar connects to a place like this...</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> So that thing faked his death and fled here. Which means\u2013</p><p><strong>Grendel:</strong> Ugh... D-Damn you...</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> We&#39;ve got you cornered. Your mom&#39;s not here, buddy.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> I&#39;ll send you to hell where you belong! I, Beowulf, will show you no mercy!</p><p><strong>Grendel:</strong> I could say...the same... I&#39;ve read the memory...of the one who killed you!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> It&#39;s over, Grendel. You&#39;re a monster that&#39;s not meant to be summoned.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> We&#39;ll likely never meet again. ...Dammit, I met the one I wanted to meet the least.</p><p><strong>Grendel:</strong> Wh-Why... The one...who killed...you...</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> Actually, you&#39;re the one I fear the most in this world. The fire dragon simply dealt the killing blow.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> It was strong, but didn&#39;t frighten me. I also now have dependable allies, unlike then.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> You&#39;re a fool to not see that.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> Good riddance, masquerader. You should&#39;ve had a bit more faith in your own strength.</p><p><strong>Grendel:</strong> D-Damn you!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Seems we really got him this time!</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> Guess so. My Noble Phantasm is unlocked now.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> In the future you&#39;ll face punks looking for a fight. When that happens, let me help you.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> Well then, I guess we should head back, Master! Time for our triumphant return!
