You remember anything?</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> No, huh.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Looks like you and I are in the same boat then.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> The situation looks pretty grim.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> I think we&#39;re in Japan sometime in the 2000s, but as you can see, there&#39;s been a huge disaster.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> And we can&#39;t seem to get in touch with Chaldea either.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Looks like our only choice is to make our way through this burning city.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> I&#39;m sure you&#39;re not thrilled about being stuck with me, but I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll find a Servant who&#39;s a better fit for this sooner or later.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> In the meantime, I&#39;ll start by cleaning up the riffraff.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Don&#39;t fall behind. Make sure you keep up.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> W-will do!</p><hr><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Well that was a waste of time. Come on, let&#39;s hurry.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You know, I&#39;ve been wondering for a while now\u2013</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Whatever it is, I&#39;m not interested unless it has to do with my capabilities.</p><hr><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> That said, the fact that you still have energy for idle chatter is good.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> If there&#39;s something you wanna ask me on the way, go ahead. If I feel like it, I&#39;ll answer.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> If you&#39;re wondering what I am, that&#39;s hard to explain.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> As a Master, you ought to know that every hero has another side to them.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Some of them, they slaughter innocent people without so much as blinking. Others, they fight to protect their country like their lives depended on it.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Most of those types that everyone looks up to have some sort of hidden cruel side.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Then you have Servants, which reflect only one side of the hero they represent.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Sometimes, a Servant&#39;ll reflect that hero&#39;s hidden side...</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> ...and sometimes, their Spirit Origin&#39;ll end up corrupted for one reason or another.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Servants like that all get lumped into a different category.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> We&#39;re talking the possible destruction of all of humanity here. We need all the help we can get, and we can&#39;t be choosy about whether we get it from good or bad people.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> ...But even there, I&#39;m an unusual case.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> The other me was a nameless hero, shaped by society at large.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> It might&#39;ve been a one-of-a-kind event, but it still happened naturally.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> But me, I&#39;m not one of a kind. I&#39;m just twisted.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> The past that made me a hero is gone, and I don&#39;t remember anything about who I used to be.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> All that&#39;s left now is my ability to kill my enemies. That&#39;s the only reason I materialized.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Is that why you spend most of your time in your spirit form?</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Yeah.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> The others try to find meaning in existence, but since I&#39;m just a weapon, I don&#39;t bother with anything outside of a fight.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> After all, no one should go waving weapons around when there&#39;s no battles to be fought, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Then, your memories</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> I know in my head that the other guy is who I used to be.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> But it doesn&#39;t feel real. It&#39;s like we&#39;ve been separated into two completely different people.</p><hr><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Anyway, enough prattling. Come on, Master.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> He never remembers the intervening moments. He simply wakes up, and there he is.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Then he turns around...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...and there is only hell as far as the eye can see.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> A place so awful it&#39;d feel presumptuous to call it a battlefield that suits him.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> He figures out who he needs to kill, and quickly focuses his effort on doing so.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> He wastes not a moment, even if he never knows why he does so.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> But the worst part is...he doesn&#39;t even care anymore.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> He leaps into the darkness, and feels as though he&#39;s falling ever deeper into the abyss.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> \u201CHey, it&#39;s not all bad,\u201D he sneers to himself, \u201Cat least I&#39;ve still got something to lose.\u201D</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> ...It&#39;s faint, but there are traces of magecraft being used up ahead.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> And since I don&#39;t see any other obvious leads, I guess we&#39;ll just have to head there next.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Come on. It&#39;ll be a walk.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> ...What? You still want to talk?</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> I can tell you&#39;re the inquisitive type, but you&#39;re better off forgetting about it.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Other Servants have pasts and presents.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> They&#39;ve got honor, goals, purpose, glory, desires, dreams, feelings... All that stuff.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> I don&#39;t have any of that. I have nothing to give, and nothing to offer.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> ...That&#39;s the main thing I&#39;ve got going for me. The cradle of my origin.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> So there&#39;s no point in learning about me.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> All you need to know is what I&#39;m capable of.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> A Shadow Servant...</p><hr><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Is this guy why we&#39;re stuck wandering around here...? Well, I guess it doesn&#39;t matter.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Fire up your magical energy, Master. We&#39;re taking him down!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> ... ...Guess he wasn&#39;t the one.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> But at least I found some new traces of magecraft. Come on, let&#39;s keep moving.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> R-right!</p><hr><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Why don&#39;t I ever talk to my other self?</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Why would I? There&#39;s no point.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> If he&#39;s all that&#39;s left of the man he used to be, I barely qualify as whatever&#39;s left over from that...</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> No, even that&#39;s giving me too much credit. If that were the case, I&#39;d still have some reason to exist.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> But I&#39;m just a thing, without any purpose. It wouldn&#39;t make any difference if I was gone.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> As far as the other guy&#39;s concerned, he could kill me a thousand times and it still wouldn&#39;t be enough.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> ...These traces lead into that cave. Let&#39;s hurry.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> ...Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s strange?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Don&#39;t I think what&#39;s strange?</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> ... ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I do, but what other choice do we have?</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Gotcha.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> At least you&#39;re not as dense as I thought.</p><hr><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> I&#39;m guessing this is a dreamworld. An artificial hell. The end of nothingness.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> A place that makes you confront your sins and demands you pay for them.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> ...I&#39;ve seen it before.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> But I don&#39;t know why we&#39;re here.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> I&#39;m not looking for anything from you, and you&#39;re not looking for anything from me.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> We&#39;re just helping each other out. That&#39;s all there is to it.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> So then, why am I\u2013why are we here?</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Anyway, let&#39;s keep moving. Whatever&#39;s going on here, we&#39;ll have to take care of it before we can go home.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I might not remember them myself, but I do have records of my past deeds.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I know exactly how many people I killed, and how many mages.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I don&#39;t feel any guilt over their deaths, and I&#39;ve never been punished for them either.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Every bullet I fire hits its mark, making the world safer.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...But the path I&#39;ve walked isn&#39;t mine alone.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> When did my path split from his?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I&#39;m not jealous. I don&#39;t envy him. I just find myself wondering from time to time.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> It feels like a monster with its jaws open wide is slowly making its way toward me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I&#39;d probably feel a lot better if I just let it swallow me up.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> But I&#39;m not that far gone.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...Not yet, anyway.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> There&#39;s nothing here...</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> You&#39;re right. But I&#39;m pretty sure this is our last stop.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I kind of thought we&#39;d find the shadowy guy with the foul mouth here.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Who&#39;re you talking about?</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> ...Ah, whatever. Just hang on.</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong> If you&#39;re here, then I doubt anybody summoned me.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> That&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> You&#39;re like a tumor that snuck its way into my dreams, aren&#39;t you? I&#39;m taking you out and getting Master home.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Hope you enjoyed your life, because it ends here.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Oh, I&#39;m pretty used to that sort of thing by now. That said...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...I&#39;m not just going to abandon my survival instinct and let you chop my head off.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> ...The hell?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> What&#39;s there to be upset about? Isn&#39;t that why you need a Master?</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> No...you&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Come on, Master. This is the last battle we&#39;ve got to fight to get home.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Let&#39;s go.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I see. Well, for your sake, I certainly hope you can return home.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AEmiya Alter:</strong> ...Something&#39;s not right.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What is it?</p><hr><p><strong>A\uFF1AEmiya Alter:</strong> ...I know my swords and bullets tore through you.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AEmiya Alter:</strong> So how are you still alive?</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong> Why wouldn&#39;t I be? A Servant can&#39;t go down without a fight.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AEmiya Alter:</strong> ...Huh!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Th-there&#39;s two of him!?</p><hr><p><strong>D\uFF1AEmiya Alter?:</strong> ...There you have it.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AEmiya Alter?:</strong> I&#39;m sure you can understand, since we are the same person.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AEmiya Alter:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AEmiya Alter:</strong> ...Yeah, I get it now. I was the tumor.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AEmiya Alter:</strong> Sure looks that way.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AEmiya Alter:</strong> There really isn&#39;t much difference between us, though.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AEmiya Alter:</strong> Our rote, mechanical way of life is just so simple that even the concept of who we are starts to get hazy.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AEmiya Alter:</strong> That&#39;s the long and short of it, Master. Now stand back a bit.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong> ...You came here to save Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AEmiya Alter:</strong> Of course. Despite everything, I&#39;m still [\u2642 his /\u2640\uFE0F her} Servant.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong> Hmph.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong> I might be the cancer here, but you&#39;re not far off from being just like me.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong> Whatever fate&#39;s got in store for us can&#39;t be that different.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AEmiya Alter:</strong> ...You might be right.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong> That said, it does look like I&#39;m getting in the way.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong> So then, there&#39;s only one way to end this.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AEmiya Alter:</strong> Don&#39;t look at him, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong> Screw that. You should see this through to the end.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong> You should see what happens when a man who&#39;s lost sight of everything is as far gone as he can be.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong> I&#39;d say it&#39;s a fitting end for me, don&#39;t you think?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> He...turned his gun...on himself...</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AEmiya Alter:</strong> I told you not to look.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> No...</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AEmiya Alter:</strong> Don&#39;t worry about it. It&#39;s what had to be done to resolve this.</p><hr><p><strong>D\uFF1AEmiya Alter:</strong> I don&#39;t blame you for not realizing he was an imposter. He wasn&#39;t.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AEmiya Alter:</strong> This dream\u2013if that&#39;s even what it really is\u2013will be over soon.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AEmiya Alter:</strong> Once you&#39;re awake, you should forget this ever happened.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AEmiya Alter:</strong> It&#39;s all been just a nightmare. That&#39;s all.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AEmiya Alter:</strong> Once you forget it, I will too. After all...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> &quot;Even things that happened five minutes ago feel like a dream from long ago.&quot;</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> You up now, Master?</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> There was something strange happening with my Spirit Origin. It happened right around the time your vitals started going haywire.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Guess you and I were sharing one of those Servant dream things.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> You look like you&#39;re all right now, but make sure you get yourself a mental health checkup too.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> So? What&#39;d you see in there?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I don&#39;t remember a thing.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Good. It&#39;s better that way.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Don&#39;t worry about it.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Whatever you saw wasn&#39;t worth remembering. It was just one possible end to one man&#39;s life.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> It was a glimpse of a future that has to come, sooner or later...</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Hmph. But I digress.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> All I remember is that it made me really sad...</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> ...I see.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Well, whatever you&#39;re sad about, I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t have to be. When you get right down to it, I&#39;m just a bullet.</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> I don&#39;t have any thoughts or ideals. Once you fire me, I&#39;m gone. Out of sight, out of mind.</p><hr><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Anyway, what do you say we get going?</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> You&#39;re on another mission to save the world, just like always, right?</p><p><strong>Emiya Alter:</strong> Like I said, I&#39;m a bullet, so lock and load. I&#39;ll keep on flying at my targets until the day I fall apart.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> &quot;A hero of justice isn&#39;t so bad.
