But from what era?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Huh? What? Where are you guys?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Right here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It looks like some battlefield?</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> You&#39;ve got all your arms and legs, right? Yeah, the both of you have proper vitals...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s going on, either. Doctor, how&#39;s it going on your end?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Let&#39;s see. According to my observations... You haven&#39;t made it to the Rayshift coordinates.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It looks like something interfered with the Rayshift process. Hmm...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Well, not interfered... If I were to phrase it properly\u2013</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Like Fujimaru was pulled somewhere suddenly, willingly?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What? Really?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I really don&#39;t remember that.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Wait a second, Senpai. There&#39;s someone over there, at twelve o&#39;clock.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> ...Master?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Lancer... Altria, right? Senpai, did you summon her?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> I don&#39;t have time to talk. They&#39;re coming.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;m picking up something moving towards you! Judging by their momentum, they probably think you&#39;re enemies!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> No choice. Get ready for battle!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, Master! They&#39;re human troops without any magical energy reaction, so\u2013</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Don&#39;t hold back. Take them all down.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> B-But we&#39;re up against\u2013</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> ...Here they come. Get ready.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Battle complete. Hostile forces...have, uh, been eliminated? What&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> This is my battlefield. Though it might&#39;ve been altered in this dream.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> I wanted to make use of my lance, as much as possible, so I asked Master something I shouldn&#39;t have.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You did?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I don&#39;t remember.</p><hr><p><strong>Altria:</strong> I got permission from you subconsciously. Sorry about that.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> My special characteristics as a Servant are what brought this about, I imagine.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Characteristics? Like a Reality Marble of some sort? But she doesn&#39;t have that kind of Noble Phantasm...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> This inquiry bores me. Now\u2013</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Let&#39;s fight. All the easy ones are done with.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...A magical energy reading! I remember this feeling...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I have something closely resembling its values on record! No doubt about it, this has to be her other self!</p><p><strong>Altria?:</strong> \u2014</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> \u2013There&#39;s another of her with a Holy Lance Rhongomyniad?! W-What&#39;s with double Rhongomyniads!?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> How interesting. The only one good enough for me is myself.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Let&#39;s go, Master. At any rate, if we don&#39;t defeat her, you can&#39;t return.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> !?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Guess we have no choice.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Mash, get ready for battle!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Yes, Master. Starting combat with the enemy Servant.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> It smells of battle. Yes. I can&#39;t be satisfied by just taking out weak opponents.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> A warrior that fights with all they have. That is my desired opponent\u2013</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...W-We managed to take her out. The battle is over...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Whew... So it&#39;s over... I worked up a sweat just watching.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Altria?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> ...Hmm.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Maybe you wanted to fight by yourself?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Maybe we shouldn&#39;t have interfered?</p><hr><p><strong>Altria:</strong> No\u2013 I am your Servant, nothing more.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> My strength includes yours. I don&#39;t really consider this fight one-vs-many and unfair.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> ...Though questions remain, so I can&#39;t say that I&#39;m satisfied. But that was good enough for now.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> In any event, let&#39;s get back to your fight.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Give me a good battlefield to fight on, Master.</p>',79),a=[s];function g(i,h){return r(),o("div",null,a)}var l=t(n,[["render",g],["__file","Artoria Pendragon - Lancer Alter.html.vue"]]);export{l as default};
