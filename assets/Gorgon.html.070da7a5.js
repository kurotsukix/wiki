Something between hard and soft...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> It felt...rough...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (Something is grasping my finger...)</p><hr><p><strong>Narration:</strong> It felt like a bottomless chasm...just waiting to swallow me whole...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> It felt damp...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> How boring...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Ah, now it&#39;s crying out saying it can wait no longer. My hair...my evil...is shamelessly driveling...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> If you do not wake up soon, I may really eat you...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (WHA...!?!?!?)</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Where am I...?</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> ...Hmph. So you have awoken. That was a close call for you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> There are scale marks on my cheek!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> There&#39;s a snake chewing on my finger!?</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> If you&#39;re disappointed that I spared your life rather than relieved...</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> ...then tell me that you lament having missed the opportunity to merge with me and melt into sweet oblivion.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> It&#39;s not too late to speak up. Don&#39;t you fret. I am always hungry.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Oh, no, no, no...no. Don&#39;t worry about me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Oh, uh, thanks, but I&#39;m...fine...</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> Mmm. What...is this place?</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> I just found myself here with you sleeping beside me. You&#39;re my Master. Do you know what is happening?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> This has happened to me a few times...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Probably a dream, or your unconscious or something...</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> ...? What do you mean? Explain more in detail.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> Hehe...hahahaha! A dream. A dream? Of mine!? Oh you ARE funny...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s...funny?</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> Of course it is. Look around you. See this cold, empty world.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> It&#39;s so dark... Not a mote of light to be seen, nor a sign of life anywhere.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> Your lungs are filled with dark and ominous air. What dread sights you can see are most sinister.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> The cold floor is damp, like a demon&#39;s entrails, and eagerly awaits you to collapse and die...</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> Its hideous walls stifle you, waiting to close around you like a coffin.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> There is nothing at all good here. A true nightmare for any human. A being of pure despair and evil...that is what I am.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> Ah... This place is a true reflection of my nature...utterly monstrous!</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> I certainly could not argue if you said this was a reflection of who I am within. All I can do is laugh at this! Hahahaha!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;re talking nonsense again...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Maybe there&#39;s a field of flowers over there...</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> ... I&#39;ve always wondered. What do you think of me, truly?</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> Now more than ever, you fail to understand my nature, which makes this a good opportunity to teach you.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> I am...evil. That is all.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> The third sister of a certain family, destined to become a monster. That is all I am.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> As my power goes beyond any mere common evil, some may even call me the mother of Demonic Beasts.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> Yet you do not fear me... Why?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> We don&#39;t have any trouble communicating...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You seem to understand what I say...</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> ...If communication is all you require, your bar is quite...low.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> And even that is only possible because, at this moment, I exist in a state between my forms as a goddess and monster.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> I honestly do not understand why I was summoned in this state...</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> Let me make myself clear. I am not a goddess. I am a monster. I am a divinity who turned evil.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> That&#39;s why you\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What&#39;s that voice!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Something&#39;s coming!</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> Hah... I am the mother of Demonic Beasts. I devour even other evils. It would not surprise me to know there are a few lurking within me.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> At least it may be amusing to watch whatever hungry beasts lurk here devour you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;d appreciate it if you&#39;d help me out...</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> Shut up. I don&#39;t care what you want.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> But... I have no intention of feeding the other evils that work within me in this dream of mine.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> Letting them feast on your flesh would be a waste. Besides, I happen to feel like exercising just now.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> Consider yourself lucky. You can cower before me once we finish here.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> Now, look upon my form and learn...</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> Learn that the being you thought you could merely talk with is a monster who will turn your stomach!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> Hahaha...what do you think!? Did you see my terrible serpent form!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Thanks! You saved me!</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> That&#39;s not what I&#39;m talking about! That&#39;s not what you should be saying!</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> You should be terrified! You should be soiling yourself! You should be begging me not to eat you!</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> This is the time to beg for your life!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So, I&#39;m thinking leaving would be a good idea...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I don&#39;t think we should stay long...</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> Ungh... This human...is unbelievable...!</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> Argh! Fine! So!? Do you have any idea how to escape!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I don&#39;t, but let&#39;s just keep going.</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> Hmph. Are you saying we should simply head in that direction?</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> The single, obvious way out in a place steeped in nothing but evil on all sides?</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> I suspect that will only lead us to a hell far worse than the one we find ourselves in now.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> But you willingly walk headlong into peril...and you are even willing to peek into the underbelly of the hideous monster I am?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m sure there are parts of yourself you don&#39;t want anyone seeing...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> We&#39;ve got to go that way to get out, sorry.</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> Silence. It seems you value neither your life nor your sanity.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> Perhaps you will realize what they were worth once you&#39;ve lost them. Hehe.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> Very well. I&#39;m intrigued.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> I shall watch your final moments and mock them to the very end. You may meet your end without fear. Hahaha.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> ...Hold it right there. Are you a fool?</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> Did you not think that carelessly venturing out might mean your death? If you simply perished, I would be robbed of my chance to watch a demon devour you.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> Just stand behind me and follow me, scum. Unbelievable...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (She might get angry again if I thank her...)</p><hr><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> I can feel the evil presence growing stronger. It certainly doesn&#39;t bother me, but you\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...?</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> Tsk. You&#39;re fine? Disappointing. Do you have no consideration for how your whimpering and looks of terror would keep me entertained on this dull journey?</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> Don&#39;t you know? Human suffering is my greatest pleasure.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> Seeing, hearing, and tasting human suffering are my favorite things to do...</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> That terror, oh it makes me drool in anticipation. There is no better seasoning for my meal.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Is that because...you&#39;re an Avenger?</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> ...What a silly thing to say.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> That class was forced upon me when I was summoned as a Servant.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> But...you&#39;re probably right. Your absurd question jogged my memory.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Memory of what?</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> Rage!</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> Yes...I may truly be an Avenger. The desire for revenge does indeed burn within my Spirit Origin.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> But...revenge against what? Whatever is it that I hate so much?</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> The unknown is what infuriates me, and it has led me to kill and devour all living things I encounter.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> That, at least, I find fulfilling, all the more so if the victim is someone I loathe.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> Heh...a monster who doesn&#39;t even know who deserves her vengeance...</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> Of all the Heroic Spirits you employ, I must be the most bizarre and horrible!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s not true...</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> Tsk. I&#39;ve said too much. Forget it.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> Either way, the stench of evil is getting stronger here. Something is bound to happ\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I-it got dark all of a sudden!</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> Quiet.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> Hmph. I can hardly see... Even my own eyes cannot see through...the darkness within me...</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> ... Fine. For now...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> And something touched me!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> I said keep quiet. That&#39;s just my hair. Hold on to it and don&#39;t let go.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> If you annoy it, it may bite off a finger or two. If you want to live, deal with it. Let&#39;s go.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (I hope she&#39;s only kidding...)</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> ... There&#39;s something up ahead...</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> ...! Is...that...</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> My older sisters...</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> And that&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> Me!!!</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> Wait. Stop. What are you doing?</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> No...what are you...trying to show me!?</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> Ah, I see.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> So this is a dream to show me what might have been!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What was that...?</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> ...Let me ask you. What did you just see?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Uh...I don&#39;t know, it was all fuzzy...</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> I see. That&#39;s a relief.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> Even if you did see something or THINK you saw something, don&#39;t ask. I&#39;ll kill you if you do.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> But...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I can still see the other Gorgon.</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> Hmph. I&#39;ll let that one slide. That&#39;s only the \u201Cme\u201D I see in my dreams.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> And that...that is... Hahaha! All the more reason to kill it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;re going to kill it!?</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> Of course. That being is the center of the evil that has flooded this realm. My body...my every instinct...cries out for that thing&#39;s blood!</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> (Instinct...that&#39;s right...instinct.)</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> (If that is true...)</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> (Is that what defines my existence? Is that how I will end up? Is it telling me to seek revenge...)</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> (...against the humans and world that led me here...?)</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> (Hehe...hahaha!!!)</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> (Who cares? Even if that were true, my purpose does not change. I am not wrong.)</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> (I devour what I wish. I kill what I wish. That is the essence of my very being!)</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> Ah, of course. Of course. In the end...this is all monsters are able to do!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> The darkness is starting to clear... Hehehe... Oh, that was satisfying!</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> And yet...that was no more than a shadow of my past and future. I know just how pointless it is.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ?</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> Hah! That vacant look... I can see you do not understand. But I do.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> What would you call something that is both satisfying and completely pointless?</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> ...Amusement.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> I had an amusing dream. If how I feel now is any indication...I would say it was a sweet dream.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> Let me reiterate: I am a monster.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> Killing that monster\u2013that other me\u2013and bathing in its blood was exhilarating. I found that dream...amusing.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> Knowing that...do you still want something like me in your Chaldea?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Of course.</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> Why? I&#39;ve told you time and time again, and you still don&#39;t get it!? I am no Heroic Spirit! I AM A MONSTER!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Whatever you are, you are here now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You answered my call...</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> ...You are mistaken.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> Even I do not know why I was summoned. It must have been some kind of accident.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Even if it&#39;s an accident or a mistake, I&#39;m happy.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Thank you for coming to Chaldea.</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> I said...you...!</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> (Sigh) So annoying. Even my hunger has dissipated.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> ...Hmph. It&#39;s almost time to wake up. I failed to devour the moron before me.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> Perhaps it is the same for humans, but I will likely forget this most amusing dream of mine.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> And if you don&#39;t want me to remember that I failed to devour you...</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> Do not ever mention what happened in this dream should you recall it. For your own safety.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> Hmph.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Oh.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What&#39;s wrong, Senpai?</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> ...! (Silent pressure)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> ... (Look that says, \u201CGood. Keep quiet.\u201D)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...?</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> Very suspicious, don&#39;t you think, \u201Cme?\u201D</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> Yes. They were exchanging knowing glances with each other, \u201Cme.\u201D</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> Hehe...our foolish younger sister, who&#39;s three times the size of the one we&#39;re used to seeing...the BBB (Big Big Big) Mountain...</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> What in the world do you think transpired between her and Master last night? I am so curious.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> Yes. We must pry it out of her...down to the last juicy detail.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> Privacy? What&#39;s that? We had no such thing on our island.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> Older sisters...!?</p><p><strong>Stheno &amp; Euryale:</strong> Fess up. Right now. Come on...hurry up...spill it...!</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> M-Master! Remember that we had planned a training session in the simulator!?</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong> Let&#39;s get going! It&#39;s important! If I don&#39;t get exercise, I&#39;ll get rusty! Now, please excuse us!</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> She&#39;s fleeing with Master! Does that mean something really...is there some truth behind what we think happened between them!?</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> Hold it right there! Do you think you can get away with keeping secrets from your older sisters!? You big, giant fool of a sister!
