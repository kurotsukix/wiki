What is it?</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> Oh, sorry. Was I humming? It&#39;s been so long since I&#39;ve walked through my home forest.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> I just, you know? I was just enjoying myself.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> Anyway, Fujimaru, are you okay? We&#39;ve been walking a long way. Are you tired?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m fine.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> I see. Okay. Glad you&#39;re doing well!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What about you? You okay?</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> Hahaha, I&#39;m a Servant! I&#39;ve got tons of stamina.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (That&#39;s what I always say, but today she said it first\u2013)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (N-No, it doesn&#39;t matter. It&#39;s not important.)</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, what is it, Fou? Why are you rubbing against me?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fo, foou. Kyuu!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I think Fou&#39;s trying to make you feel better. Boudica&#39;s like everyone&#39;s big sister.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> So Fujimaru ends up being like her little [\u2642 brother /\u2640\uFE0F sister}. Yup, yup.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> And that means Mash is going to feel lonely. \u2013That&#39;s what Fou&#39;s saying, I think.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fooou.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Thank you, Fou.

Before we rayshifted...</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> I used the kitchen in the Chaldea living quarters to make us some lunch.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> If you&#39;re hungry, would you like to have some?</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> I tried making Japanese rice balls. It&#39;s my first time, so I don&#39;t know if they&#39;ll be good\u2013</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> But if you&#39;re hungry, how about it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Thanks.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I am feeling hungry.</p><hr><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> Really? Great! Okay\u2013let&#39;s take a break here.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> Hey, Mash, how about it? Can we rest?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, yes. It should be safe. We need to give Senpai a chance to rest, too.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> Hooray\u266A Let&#39;s eat, then! I think we could rest by that grass over there, right?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Foou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s right. We won&#39;t need to lay down a blanket then\u2013</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;m jealous you guys get to have a picnic! I&#39;m eating by myself...wait!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Multiple magical energy signature detected! We may have found our target!</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> Oh, jeez! I was looking forward a good relaxation in the forest.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> These nasty little goblins are interrupting just when it&#39;s getting good!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Multiple packs coming from the front, Master! Be careful.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...Heheh. Yummy woman...yummy...hahaha.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Kill the men... Take the women back to the nest, heheh.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> !!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> !!!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Delicious-looking women? ...O-Oh no! I heard the ancient Celtic goblins were primitive!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> But this goes beyond primitive, and sounds like they&#39;re planning something weird!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> B-But are they? Are they planning something weird!?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fo, foou!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Doctor? Fou, too...? Why are you so agitated?</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> Not only have you interrupted our rest, you have defiled the forests of Britannia\u2013</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> I was planning on resting Fujimaru on my lap and give the Master a much needed pampering\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh?</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the Grail&#39;s influence, but these goblins have grown bigger than usual!</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> I remember normal goblins being a little bit smaller than this!</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> You weird goblins, I will never\u2013</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> Ever, lose to you!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> !!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> !!!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> !!!!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Huh? Y-You&#39;re not doing that on purpose, right!? Boudica, that&#39;s what people say when they lose\u2013</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> Huh? What?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Doctor, what are you saying?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> L-Let&#39;s just fight!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> We will never lose!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Right, Master! Commencing combat!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> &quot;...Damn it...&quot;</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> &quot;...You captured us girls...&quot;</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> &quot;...And took us here... What are you going to do to us...&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Hehehehe, just what you think!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Hehehehe, you&#39;ll find out soon!</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> &quot;...O-Oh no...&quot;</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> &quot;...Sob... I-If you&#39;re going to do that to us, I&#39;d rather you just...&quot;</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Doctor, Senpai, what are you doing?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> First you ordered a panting Boudica to &quot;Look down, embarrassed,&quot; during battle...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...and then you started saying this weird stuff... Why? What&#39;s the meaning of this?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> No, hahaha! It&#39;s nothing! I just wanted to try it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Sorry.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I couldn&#39;t help myself.</p><hr><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> Hahaha, I had fun! Anyway\u2013</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> Thanks for coming with me, guys. We wiped out those bad goblins from my home&#39;s forests.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> When you fixed Nero&#39;s era, I got a bad feeling.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> So I came here to check it out, and sure enough, I was right.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I believed in you. I knew your intuition was correct.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> Thanks, Mash. You really are a good girl. I&#39;ll give you something nice later.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> N-Not really...</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> But I&#39;ve never seen goblins swell up like that. There were so many, and they attacked us.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> Forest spirits aren&#39;t necessary always like that, you know.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> It should be rare to see them at all. Hmm...</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> Maybe this is the Grail&#39;s doing? What a mess that thing makes.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Oh, yeah. If you look through the records it causes all kinds of trouble.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Is it that easy... for human wishes to cause disaster?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The Grail can grant any wish, so it can easily cause disasters. Which means that maybe...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Human wishes themselves often bring disaster. That&#39;s just a theory though\u2013</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> Yes. You might be right.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> But I don&#39;t think I want to believe that.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> Wishes are supposed to be... They&#39;re supposed to be much simpler things.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> More humble, and warmer, I think.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> For example...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> For example?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou?</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> Like eating a nice meal with someone you love, maybe.</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> That&#39;s what I mean. Do you understand\u2013what I&#39;m saying?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yup! Lunchtime!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Let&#39;s get back to that break!</p><hr><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> Hahaha, that&#39;s right! Now, sit down. I&#39;ll get the lunches out!</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> Fujimaru, you sit next to me. Come on, you too, Mash! You sit next to me, too!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> R-Right!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!</p>',133),a=[e];function g(i,p){return t(),s("div",null,a)}var h=o(r,[["render",g],["__file","Boudica.html.vue"]]);export{h as default};
