Ahh, my poor mind.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> What could have happened to transform me so grotesquely?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I may have been known as \u201Cterrible\u201D in my time, but I never imagined I would actually become so literally.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Ahh, and yet, my soul stirs with the desire to serve all of humanity.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> It seems I must ask my faithful underling...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Or rather, my beloved Master, about this change in my circumstances.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Why am I an elephant?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;re just bringing this up now!?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ......</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, I&#39;m sorry! I was just so taken aback that I was genuinely at a loss for words.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m sorry, Ivan. Um, is it okay if I call you Ivan?</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Indeed, it is. I see no need for formalities here.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Still, I have thought my body seemed strangely heavy for a while now... And I also thought my tusks were getting a little long in the tooth. Literally.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> At any rate, the question remains. Why am I an elephant?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s a long story.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. A very, very long story...</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> No matter. Start at the beginning.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Okay then...</p><hr><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Hmm, I see. So I was fused with Demonic Beasts...</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Now I understand. That must have been a most trying time for both of you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, it was...</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> I will not ask that you forget what happened. But I will tell you not to let it hold you back.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> After all, your battle is far from over.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> All that aside, it sounds as though my archive did not exist in this Lostbelt place.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Archive? Do you mean your legendary library?</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Indeed, I do.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> It contained all manner of books from throughout history and the world, including a number of grimoires. It was a tremendous cultural achievement, and my pride and joy.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Unfortunately, it was burned to the ground after my death, and any books that remained were scattered far and wide.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So it would seem. We don&#39;t have any records on your library in our database, either.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> All it says is that mages have been trying to find it for a very long time.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> They must have been searching for my grimoires and their accompanying instruments. I did gather quite a lot of them, after all.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It looks like there was even one family who kept searching for a particular book across three generations with only the barest of leads to go on...</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Hmm. Speaking of books...</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> While I am certainly glad that Chaldea&#39;s database has managed to preserve some books in digital form...</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> ...it seems I will not get the chance to turn the pages of a paper book again, at least not while the world is in its present state.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Don&#39;t be so sure.</p><hr><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> What do you mean?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I know!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> As a matter of fact, Novum Chaldea now has its very own library, underneath the first floor.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Does it now?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> If you&#39;re interested, I&#39;d be glad to show you the way.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Yes, please do.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> (Ahh, another peaceful day in the library.)</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> (It has just the right amount of people; not too many, and not too few.)</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> (It may no longer be as popular as it was when it was the hot new thing, but there remains a steady crowd of booklovers who visit regularly.)</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> (Not only that, today, I get to read a brand-new work from the great William Shakespeare...)</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> (...all while enjoying a plate of Japanese sweets Lady Tomoe Gozen made to practice her baking.)</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> (This is truly shaping up to be a perfect afternoon...)</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> (Hmm, interesting...)</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> (Oh my! What a shocking development!)</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> (I can&#39;t believe he brought in a guest character from Macbeth!)</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> (Ahh, I can scarcely wait to turn the next page and see how it ends.)</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> (And yet, at the same time, I can&#39;t help but wish it would never end...)</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> (But then, I suppose those two conflicting emotions are the mark of any good book...)</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> ...Oh my. Are those...footsteps?</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> It&#39;s me. Umu.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> ...I mean, it is I.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Eep! Lord Ivan the Terrible!</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> I have just learned of this underground library&#39;s existence and have come to pay it a quiet, unofficial visit.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Feel free to continue reading your book. I will find my own way around.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> O-oh no, I couldn&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> As Chaldea&#39;s librarian, I have a duty to give new visitors a proper tour.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Is that so? Very well then, lead the way.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Of course. Please, follow me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (...Peek)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That sweet bean jelly looks reeeally good...</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Please try to focus on the matter at hand, Senpai!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> And that, with the exception of the storeroom, is the library.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> I see...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Hm?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Is there something not to your satisfaction?</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Oh, I was just thinking how about how much this library&#39;s contents differ from my archive.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Does that mean you found it disappointing?</p><hr><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> No, it is not that.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Most of the books I collected were ancient philosophical texts, grimoires, and treatises on various subjects.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> I had always meant to translate them into my mother tongue so that I could gain even greater wisdom, but it seems such books are few and far between here.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> True, not many patrons check out philosophy books or treatises, so we usually keep them in the archive.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> And as a rule, books in the archive are only meant to be read there and may not be checked out.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Also, unfortunately...I&#39;m afraid we have very little in the way of grimoires or books on magecraft.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> I&#39;m so sorry. I know almost nothing about Western magecraft or sorcery, so...</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> All that aside, it seems to me that this library still has room for further expansion.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Hm?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Well, yes, this space was all constructed using magecraft, so there is still plenty of room left to expand...</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Very good.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Master, I have made up my mind.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> I am going to gather more books with which to further expand this library, and you are going to help me.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> !!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> More books...?</p><hr><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Indeed.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> This library holds great potential.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> It deserves to be a singular collection with collections and rare books from every corner of the globe; one that is at least every bit the equal of my archive.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> O-oh my! That would be absolutely wonderful, but I&#39;m afraid that, well...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. I&#39;m sorry to have to tell you this, Ivan, as it really is a lovely idea...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...but we&#39;re just not allowed to bring back books or other important objects from Rayshifts.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That goes double for especially rare and notable books and grimoires.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> True. However, I have an idea how to get around that.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Surely it cannot take much data to digitize a book.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Therefore, we should be able to bring back any books we find in digital form, then simply recreate them as physical copies.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Isn&#39;t that counterfeiting!?</p><hr><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Hmm... Yes, I suppose it might be. However, humanity itself is currently on the verge of annihilation.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Thus, as lovers of the written word, it is our right\u2013 nay, our duty, to gather as many books as we can.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> Hahaha! I like the way you think, Ivan the Terrible!</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Hm? That voice...</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> I see, I see.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> You and I may not share a direct connection...</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> But as an avid reader who once made the Library of Alexandria a household name around the world, I just couldn&#39;t stay away from an endeavor such as this.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> I see...</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Does this mean you too will help me to expand this library, Iskandar, descendant of the great Zeus?</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> You need even ask?</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> My chariot can take us anywhere we wish to go in a single leap.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> Of course, preserving books as data instead of just taking them by force isn&#39;t nearly as exciting from a conqueror&#39;s perspective.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> But, circumstances being what they are, I suppose I can&#39;t complain.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> (Oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh. This is all becoming a far greater ordeal than I had expected!)</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> (Which isn&#39;t to say I wouldn&#39;t also love to grow my library further, because I absolutely would, but still...!)</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> (Oh gosh, oh gosh...)</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> Well then, shall we?</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Indeed, we shall.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It looks like there&#39;s no turning back now, Murasaki Shikibu.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> So it would seem...</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> By the way, Murasaki Shikibu, does this library have a proper name?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Huh!?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Y-yes. It&#39;s known as the underground library...</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> I see. Such modesty may be common among dignitaries in the Far East where you come from...</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> ...but if we are to collect books from all across the world here, a name as pedestrian as \u201Cunderground library\u201D will never do.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> I see, I see.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> After all, this place is about to become a second Library of Alexandria!</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> In fact, now that I mention it...</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> I see now that this library&#39;s new name will have to include \u201CGreat Library of Alexandria\u201D!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> I-I suppose you&#39;re right!</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Very well then, I shall try my hand at naming it.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> \u201CThe Ivan the Terrible Great Library of Alexandria\u201D... Hmm. I like the sound of that.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> Agreed. But I&#39;m afraid there&#39;s still a crucial name missing.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Huh? (I&#39;ve got a terrible feeling about this.)</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Heh. Not to worry. I have of course already thought of that.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> It is only proper that the rightful owner&#39;s name also be included.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Therefore, this library shall henceforth be known as...</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> \u201CThe Ivan the Terrible Murasaki Shikibu the Beautiful Great Library of Alexandria\u201D!</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Done and done!!!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> (Out cold)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> M-Murasaki! Speak to us, Murasaki!</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> It is unfortunate that Murasaki Shikibu could not be here with us due to her suddenly and inexplicably feeling unwell...</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> Ah, don&#39;t worry! She&#39;ll be overjoyed to see our triumphant return with so many books and so much data that she&#39;ll be back to her old self in no time!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (I&#39;ve gotta figure out a way to change that name,or she might never recover!)</p><hr><p><strong>F\uFF1AMash:</strong> This is Mash Kyrielight, handling the comms for this Rayshift.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1AMash:</strong> We set your first destination as London in the hope that you would be able to find plenty of rare books here.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Hm?</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> Oh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> There&#39;s a lot of pressure in the air here...</p><hr><p><strong>F\uFF1AMash:</strong> Yes, there is. I can see it on my monitor here as well.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1AMash:</strong> I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ll just have to manage it as best you can, Master.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1AMash:</strong> By the way, Ivan and Iskandar, I managed to uncover some data from nineteenth century London.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1AMash:</strong> There&#39;s an old bookstore not too far from your current position that should have rare books in stock.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> Then let&#39;s get plundering!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Too far. Dial it back a notch.</p><hr><p><strong>F\uFF1AMash:</strong> P-plundering!? I-I really can&#39;t endorse that...</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> They are right, Great King. Plundering is solely a last resort.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> In times of peace, it is only right that books be obtained with money rather than force.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Only problem is, we don&#39;t have any money...</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Plundering it is.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;m guessing nobody&#39;s working there right now...</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> I suppose we have no other choice then.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1AMash:</strong> (He gave up on that awfully quickly...)</p><hr><p><strong>Ghost:</strong> Welcome.</p><p><strong>Ivan &amp; Iskandar:</strong> Let&#39;s kill it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Dial it back! Dial it back!</p><hr><p><strong>F\uFF1AMash:</strong> Strongly seconded!</p><p><strong>F\uFF1AMash:</strong> It hasn&#39;t shown any signs of hostility so far! Please, let&#39;s just hear it out!</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> ...Very well, Mash. If you insist.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Go on, Master. I grant you permission to begin negotiations.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> Haha, sorry about that. Old plundering habits die hard for men like us!</p><p><strong>Ghost:</strong> Welcome. Anything I can help you find today?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yeah, we&#39;re actually looking for rare books.</p><hr><p><strong>Ghost:</strong> Right this way then. Just a moment.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Oho. Well now.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> I am greatly surprised to see a complete copy of the original Gutenberg Bible in a shop such as this.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> Well, well. A new translation of \u201CThe Iliad,\u201D huh.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> Hmm... I&#39;ve only read a few pages here and there so far, but this seems to be quite an interesting version.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> Let&#39;s get this one too, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Excuse me...</p><hr><p><strong>Ghost:</strong> Yes?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> We were actually hoping to, uh,copy these books instead of buying them...</p><hr><p><strong>Ghost:</strong> Hmm. I have no clue what you are talking about, but I understand the situation.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> How does that work?</p><p><strong>Ghost:</strong> Though I must say, I cannot imagine these copies will have anything to equal the love that went into making the originals.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I get that, but still...</p><hr><p><strong>Ghost:</strong> So here&#39;s an idea. You and I fight each other in mortal combat.</p><p><strong>Ghost:</strong> If you win, I will allow you to copy the books&#39; data.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> Plundering it is.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> That it is.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1AMash:</strong> (Is it just me, or do they both seem much more animated now?)</p><p><strong>Ghost:</strong> I have been reading these books for over two hundred years, long after I became nothing but skin and bones, and eventually dust.</p><p><strong>Ghost:</strong> I have read grimoires and rare books of every conceivable shape, size, and color. I&#39;ve even read books that move about on their own.</p><p><strong>Ghost:</strong> If you want to create an unauthorized digital facsimile my collection, then do your worst!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> How do you even know what all that is!?</p><hr><p><strong>Ghost:</strong> I&#39;ve always been on top of the latest trends. Now come, let&#39;s take this outside.</p><p><strong>Ghost:</strong> After all, I&#39;d die if anything were to happen to my books.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Hrn!</p><p><strong>Ghost:</strong> Bwaaa!</p><p><strong>F\uFF1AMash:</strong> The ghost who may just love books more than anyone else in human history has been defeated!</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Quite. I am most impressed at the power your soul possesses entirely as a result of your bibliophilia.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Nonetheless, I assume our victory means you no longer have an issue with our plundering\u2013that is, our digitizing your books?</p><p><strong>Ghost:</strong> Yes, I no longer have any issue with that.</p><p><strong>Ghost:</strong> But I&#39;m afraid that still leaves two other matters that need to be resolved.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> Oh? And what might those be?</p><p><strong>Ghost:</strong> First off: payment.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yeah... Should&#39;ve seen that coming.</p><hr><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> We would never need concern ourselves with payment if we had simply plundered the books to begin with...</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> But if this is your wish, Master, then so be it. I shall cover the charge myself.</p><p><strong>Ghost:</strong> Finally, there&#39;s one last important thing I must tell you.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Oh?</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> What is it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Uh... Why do you keep scooting away?</p><hr><p><strong>Ghost:</strong> Yes, well, while I am obviously haunting this bookstore...</p><p><strong>Ghost:</strong> ...I only do so because I was a very devoted customer. I don&#39;t actually own it.</p><p><strong>Ghost:</strong> Still, as I love books more than anything, I felt an obligation to do my best to protect them.</p><p><strong>Ghost:</strong> Which is why I&#39;m going to use this money to open up my very own bookstore!</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> ... ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>All:</strong> Get back heeere!!!</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> Well, that turned out to be quite the fine mess.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I still can&#39;t believe we ended up having to fight it again...</p><hr><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Quite. I never thought a devoted bibliophile would exploit their bibliophilia for such blatant fraud and deception.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> And that half-hearted devotion makes it that much more difficult to deal with.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> It has been a long time since I so fervently wished to sit someone atop a keg filled with gunpowder and set it alight.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> Excuse me, coming through...</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> ...Um, coming through?</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> Excuse me! I said, coming through!</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> Move over already!</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Ah, I beg your pardon.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> Ugh.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> I swear, you guys need to be way more aware of how much space you take up. Especially in the hallway.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> Hahaha, I haven&#39;t had a talking-to like that since I was a boy.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Quite.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> It has been a long time indeed since anyone reprimanded me.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Once you become the tsar, most people do not dare to so much as raise their voice in your presence.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Especially little girls like her.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> Oppress\u2013I mean, excuse me, but would you mind making way?</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Ah, right.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> Hmm. I appreciate the attempt, but it&#39;s still a tight squeeze...</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> Hrn!</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> Oppressors, you should refrain from standing side by side.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> You are both much too bulky for that.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> Hahaha, I don&#39;t think you&#39;re in any position to talk.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> ......I see.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> I had forgotten I am an elephant now. It is no wonder I am so big.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> What, you&#39;re telling me you really didn&#39;t know?</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Indeed, I did not.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> I merely happened to look in a mirror for the first time in a long time...</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> ...and thought \u201COh, right. What am I now, anyway?\u201D</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> Hahaha, I see you&#39;re just as audacious as your body is spacious!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I finished reproducing the books. The copies turned out very well.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Of course, once everything is back to normal, I&#39;m afraid we&#39;ll have to destroy them...</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> Why bother? What the higher-ups don&#39;t know won&#39;t hurt them!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I see it takes audacity to know audacity...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> At any rate, I&#39;m sure Murasaki will be thrilled. Let&#39;s go bring them to her, Senpai!</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Oh, yes, I still need to see a sculptor about ordering a nameplate that says:</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> \u201CThe Ivan the Terrible Murasaki Shikibu the Beautiful Great Library of Alexandria\u201D!</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> ...Yes, this will be an excellent library indeed.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> Hm.</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> You two. A word.</p><p><strong>Ivan &amp; Iskandar:</strong> !!!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> L-let me try saying it once again to see if I can get used to it.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> \u201CThe Ivan the Terrible Murasaki Shikibu the Beautiful Great Library of Alexandria\u201D...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> ...I can&#39;t! I just can&#39;t bear it!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> I have to refuse their kind but misguided offer, or I&#39;ll be so embarrassed I&#39;ll collapse into a pile of ether!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> It won&#39;t be easy, but at least I know that both Lord Ivan and Lord Iskandar are willing to listen to reason.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll let me remove my name from the library as long as I plead my case earnestly.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> I just have to do my best to not be so bowled over by their intimidating auras that I&#39;m unable to get a word in...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> (Inhale)... (Exhale)...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Hi, Murasaki! We&#39;re back!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> !</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> O-oh, yes. Hello, Lady Mash, Master, Lord Ivan, and Lord Iskandar.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Welcome back.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> Take a look! Our book-finding expedition was a grand success!</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Indeed.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> A single Rayshift was all it took to find satisfactory spoils.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> These are the copies we made from the data we brought back. Rare books, grimoires, limited editions, single print runs...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So! Where would you like us to put them!?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> !</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> O-oh my goodness. What an extraordinary selection of precious books! This is amazing...</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> On another note, Murasaki Shikibu, Ivan and I wanted to apologize about getting carried away with the name.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Indeed.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Spartacus showed us the error of our ways in no uncertain terms.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> He told us that it was the height of both tyranny and oppression...</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> ...to adorn this library with our names when you are its rightful custodian.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Oh, yes, well...</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> Indeed. And he was right.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> If this land was ours to rule, putting our names on an institution would be considered a great honor...</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> But this is not our land, and so different considerations hold greater weight here.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Indeed, Spartacus&#39;s argument was most convincing.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> However, all that being said...</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> We were still hoping you wouldn&#39;t mind leaving the adjectives associated with our names in the library&#39;s name.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Though of course, those adjectives suit you just as well as they do us.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> ... ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (Come on, Murasaki!
