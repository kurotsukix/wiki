I&#39;ve been looking for you.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Let&#39;s get going, then! Come on, come on! This way! Come on!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Where are we going?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Um, you&#39;re a little too close.</p><hr><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> We&#39;re going, of course, to our...

And a clear blue sea as far as the eye can see!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> It&#39;s the perfect day for a honeymoon, isn&#39;t it Master?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> ...That said. (Glance)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...(Hmph)</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fooou...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Well, one or two tag-alongs shouldn&#39;t bother us too much.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Oh, how about something to drink? D A R L I N G\u266A</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I really don&#39;t want to know, but how did this happen?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I mean, I really, really don&#39;t want to know. Actually, just forget it.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Too bad, here&#39;s how it happened! Listen up. Yesterday, I got a message from Kiyohime, my texting buddy.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> I just went on a date with my Master, who is also my lover.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> A lover&#39;s tryst, you could say. A lover&#39;s tryst.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> &quot;So, how are things with your Master, Tamamo... Oh. (gotcha.) Anyway, I&#39;ll text again sometime\u266A&quot;</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Can you believe she sent that!? What the hell was (gotcha.)? What is she saying she got!?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Kids these days... Even Osakabe-hime, who never leaves her room...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Is going on &quot;chat dates!&quot;</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> At this point, I have no choice but to act!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> So I&#39;m sending selfies of me and my Master being lovey-dovey, just to show the two of them who&#39;s boss...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So... It doesn&#39;t have to be with Senpai, does it?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> That&#39;s right. She just wants to brag that she&#39;s getting along well with her Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Caster, you&#39;re toying with me?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Caster, let&#39;s end our contract...</p><hr><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Oh, no! No! Not at all! It&#39;s true that I&#39;ve sworn my soul to another.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Even though I don&#39;t quite remember what that person was like, or even which dimension did I encountered them in.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> But that&#39;s different!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> I respect Fujimaru for making a contract with an Anti-Hero like me, and with no complaints!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> I&#39;ve seduced countless men and committed countless sins. But if I feel this one&#39;s the one, I&#39;ll serve with my whole spirit\u2014</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> That is my true nature as Tamamo-no-Mae, the Caster!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Okay, so maybe &quot;honeymoon&quot; was going too far, but maybe you can at least call it a vacation? Maybe? Tee hee hee!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Sorry to interrupt, but we have enemies. Looks like this is a Lamia spawning ground.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It looks like you&#39;re surrounded? What? Your discussion&#39;s more important? Sorry.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Why now, of all times!? Geez, this is just great.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Now I feel awkward, like when you run into an old friend and you find out she&#39;s married and has children now...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> ...I&#39;m going to take it out on these... What were they? Lamias?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> All right, fine. I&#39;ll join you!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Yeah, I know how you feel.</p><hr><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> That&#39;s my Master! I&#39;m even more in love with you now!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Now that we&#39;re both on the same page, excuse me while I give a little speech.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> I will come to your aid whether you ask for it or not! The reliable Shrine Maiden Fox, Casko-chan, now descends upon the tropical seas!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Wow, it sure is nice to relax in a mountain inn, isn&#39;t it, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Sure is.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I want to relax...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What&#39;s going on here...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Don&#39;t ask me. No idea...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fooou...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> So Master... Oh who is it, at a time like this...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Oh, a message from Kiyohime? What does it say...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> &quot;Today I went shopping with my Master, who is also my husband.&quot;</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> &quot;We went to a famous French clothing store... Oh, what was its name? Anyway, there my Master bought me some Western-style clothes.&quot;</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> &quot;I get so put on the spot by things like this. So Tamamo, do you... Oh. (Gotcha.)&quot;</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> &quot;Anyway, I&#39;ll text again sometime. -from France with love- Your Kiyohime&quot;</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> This again! I&#39;m asking you, what the hell is this? What the hell is this, this (Gotcha.)?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> In the first place, I&#39;m sure her partner is being tricked!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Not Kiyohime?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> The partner is!?</p><hr><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Yes. It&#39;s not polite to say, but unlike me, Kiyohime can get the weirdest ideas in her head.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Tendencies for love at first sight aside, she often creates relationships in her mind without talking to the men involved.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Her imagination when it comes to these things could put virtual reality to shame. Every relationship she imagines already has marriage on the horizon.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Ultimately she traps the guy inside a bell and burns him to death. That&#39;s how she is, so I worry about her partner...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Oh, I should&#39;ve brought us lunches or something.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fooou...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I hate to interrupt, but I&#39;m picking up something... Yeah. It looks like we&#39;re in wyvern territory.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Again? Jeez, I just want to make some memories with my Master. Why do they keep interrupting?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> This isn&#39;t fair! My texting buddy does this to me every single day!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Her texts always sound so happy! I CAN&#39;T TAKE IT ANYMORE!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Me neither.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ME NEITHER!</p><hr><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Wyverns, flying lizards, I don&#39;t know what you are... But how I feel on all those Sundays...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> The feeling that I should do something meaningful but ends up on the couch, getting nothing done...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Then after a bath, realizing I&#39;m already getting into bed... That dismal feeling...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> I&#39;LL TAKE THEM ALL OUT ON YOU!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I&#39;m actually feeling the same way. Oh, Senpai! I was joking! I-I&#39;ll do my best!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Well, I&#39;m glad you two had fun yesterday...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What exactly was all that, anyway?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fooouu...</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Oh, Master! Trouble! Big trouble!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What is it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Another text message?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Now what is it? Did Osakabe-hime ask you on a double date or something?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> No, she&#39;s, you know, in the middle of a very cute internet romance.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> The problem is the active one, Kiyohime. It seems, um... she got\u2013dumped.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Yes, apparently she got mad and started setting everything on fire.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> I wanted to ignore it, but you know, she&#39;s a dear friend.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> We&#39;d both promised to enroll in that cooking class held by Benienma from Severed-Tongue Sparrow, you see.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> So out of my deep compassion and love, I think Master and I need to stop her!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> It&#39;s a friend&#39;s job to be supportive at times like this, right?</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> \u2013Though I&#39;ve never met her in person.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> So come on! Come on! Come! Come! With the deep bonds between us,</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> we shall heal poor Kiyohime&#39;s wounded heart! No ulterior motives, of course!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Oh, the shield girl is welcome too, I suppose...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;ll pass. Senpai, please try to avoid being burned to death, okay?</p><h2 id="nine-tailed-fox" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#nine-tailed-fox" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Nine-tailed Fox</h2><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The enemy type is a demon!
