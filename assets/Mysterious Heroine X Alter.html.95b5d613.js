I can literally see you wobbling your throat with your hand to do it!</p><p><strong>X:</strong> There&#39;s no way a weird robot like that would exist in the Servantverse!</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> I don&#39;t have a problem with it. We already have Professor Babbagen and Evil Wind 2B.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> This is my room, by the way. It&#39;s got a kotatsu and everything. Hehehe. I&#39;ve also got plenty of sweets to go with our tea.</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong> (...)</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Oh please. As if a robot would ever want to go in a kotatsu.</p><p><strong>X:</strong> You&#39;re weirdly nice to the walking scrap heap, Ex... I don&#39;t know why, but I don&#39;t like it!</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> Oh... Really?</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> She seems like a much better robot than my Black Knight Voloid. My Voloid can&#39;t even walk on two legs.</p><p><strong>X:</strong> I swear, just how low IS your opinion of your Voloid?</p><p><strong>X:</strong> And apparently, you&#39;re not even interested in trading that old bucket in for a newer model?</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> What can I say? That Black Knight and I have been through a lot together.</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong> The Du Stallion II has seen better days, too...</p><p><strong>X:</strong> What was that!?</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Did you just throw shade at my beloved spaceship that&#39;s practically in factory new condition!?</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong> BEEEP. That was. A memory bug. Don&#39;t worry about it.</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Grrr, oh forget it! I&#39;m just gonna help myself to ALL the sweets on the kotatsu then!</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> By all means. Go ahead, Robot, you can have some too.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> As a Servantverse robot, you should at least be able to digest sweet beans.</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong> ...(Eyes welling up with tears) Aw, Ex, you&#39;re the bes\u2013(Cough, hack, cough)!</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong> Thank you.

Sure, no problem.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> Everyone else, please feel free to help yourselves to the sweets, too.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> What would you like, Master? I also have some piping hot green tea.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> A chestnut cake and chestnut dumpling, please.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> You have excellent taste, Master. Chestnuts go great with all sorts of sweets.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> This chestnut cake not only has delicious chestnut adzuki beans, its crisp, crunchy shell is a work of art on its own.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This chestnut jelly is really soft and scrumptious too!</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong> ...I see. I now understand everything. Today is a day for evaluating different kinds of sweets.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (Munch, munch) That&#39;s, um, probably not quite right. At least, I don&#39;t think it is.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Give me everything you&#39;ve got, please.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> ...Oho... (Clatter)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> W-wait! X Alter, please put away your twin blades!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m sure Senpai only meant [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she} wanted to have one of every TYPE of sweet. Right, Senpai?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Right?</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> Hmm... All right, I suppose that is acceptable.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> And I do want you to have a firm grasp on the kinds of sweets I like.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong> ... (Venting exhaust in lieu of sighing)</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So, um... Now that we&#39;ve all had some lovely tea and a chance to relax, maybe we should get down to business...?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong> I agree. What is this all about?</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong> This is the XXth Servantverse Servant Assem\u2013</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong> You have already said as much. What I want to know is, who chose these members?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong> I can understand why my pilot candidate and Mash might be here...</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong> ...but why would you ask me to attend a \u201CServantverse Servant Assembly\u201D?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong> As you all surely know, I am the proud steel guardian of Castle Csejte!</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong> I want no part of any world as slapdash and ill-defined as this \u201CServantverse.\u201D</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Huh?</p><p><strong>X:</strong> You come from a world with a Japanese castle stacked on a pyramid stacked on a European castle. You have a giant steel demoness robot, Elisa Particles... How is that different than the Servantverse?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong> Blasphemy! Now be quiet and let me speak. Hmph...</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong> I hope whoever invited me here didn&#39;t do so solely because I&#39;m a robot...did they?</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong> (Hack, cough, cough)</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong> (There&#39;s no way I can say I just asked her to come so I&#39;d have some extra camouflage for my cover story now!)</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong> Uh, beep boop, of course not.</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong> (Monotone) I invited you here as an...honorary Servantverse Servant.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong> Oh...</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> That&#39;s weird. I could have sworn you were a full-fledged member of the Servantverse, Mecha Eli-chan.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> I remember the demoness of the demon castle played a huge part in the CEO of Amazones&#39; autobiographical movie.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> There was the scene where you went diving in the liquid hydrogen oceans on a gas giant planet... Your trip to the Bermuda Triangle...</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> Your trip to that neutron star with the ultramagnetic field that&#39;s impossible to escape... And then there was\u2013</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong> What... What are you talking about? I&#39;ve never done anything like that in all my operational history.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> I was also told you&#39;re exceedingly knowledgeable when it comes to Western sweets.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> You can fight, you can sing, you can bake... You&#39;re the perfect robot come to life.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> They also said you make amazing Halloween-themed pies! I do know chestnuts and pumpkin are a sublime combination in sweets, so I can believe it.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong> I-it&#39;s really just a hobby. Anyway, I still don&#39;t fully understand, but, all right.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong> If this is basically just a tea party for proper ladies, then I have no objection.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong> (Besides, I&#39;ve been invited to oil parties courtesy of Danzo, but I&#39;ve never been to a tea party before.)</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong> Very well. An opportunity like this doesn&#39;t come around every day.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong> As the guardian of Csejte with an understanding of Halloween, it&#39;s my duty to allow for elegant, stylish times like\u2013</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong> Do you have any curry cake? Or maybe cutlet cake?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong> (Twitch)</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong> ...Anyway, this is essentially a meeting, yes? So what&#39;s our agenda for today&#39;s proceedings?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (Mecha Eli-chan&#39;s pretty much running the show now.)</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> Hmm. I don&#39;t have any of the junky cake X likes...</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> But since it&#39;s not every day that all of us Servantverse Servants are gathered together like this, we probably should do something special...</p><p><strong>X:</strong> I know! We can have a one-on-one-on-one battle to see which of us is the strongest X of all!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Well someone&#39;s a little too fired up for their own good.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> You said it. That is hardly the sort of thing to suit a meeting.</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong> (Nodding vigorously in assent)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;d rather hear more about the Servantverse.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong> I completely agree with my pilot candidate.</p><hr><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong> Wouldn&#39;t it be much more productive to acquire verifiable intel on any possible Servantverse threats, so we can come up with appropriate means to counter them before they pose a threat?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong> Especially when it comes to Foreigner-class entities!</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong> I concur! (Venting exhaust)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um... I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a threat we need to be overly concerned with...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That aside, I&#39;d love to learn more about the world all you Xs come from!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I think you two said you were roommates there, right, X and Alter?</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong> That is right. It really takes me back.</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Nobody asked you, you hunk of junk!</p><p><strong>X:</strong> That said, it&#39;s true that we were forced to share a dorm room back at Cosmo-Chaldea High School.</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Grrr, just thinking about it pisses me off all over again!</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> I didn&#39;t mind sharing a room in theory, but X was the worst possible roommate I could have imagined.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> Now that I think about it...</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> ...our teacher, Nameless Red, might have set that up to try and improve X&#39;s behavior, even just a little...</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Trust me, it was no picnic for me either, sister!</p><p><strong>X:</strong> We didn&#39;t just have to share our room. We were even forced to complete an assignment together...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> An assignment? You mean, at Cosmo-Chaldea High?</p><hr><p><strong>X:</strong> Yup. Killing villains, basically.</p><p><strong>X:</strong> I&#39;m sure it was supposed to be Nameless Red&#39;s mission, but he pawned it off on his students!</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> I think it was on Planet Totooine. That was a seriously brutal case...</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong> This was back in the start of season one.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> That&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> This was when our ratings were in the gutter, when viewers thought we were just another weird series.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Season? Ratings?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;ve got to tell us more now!</p><hr><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> Sure, no problem. So, Planet Totooine is...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>\u2013 Planet Totooine \u2013</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Gaah! Ugh, blech! I&#39;m gonna be washing sand out of everywhere for days!</p><p><strong>X:</strong> How the hell does a planet RAIN sand!? Everywhere we go, it&#39;s just sand, sand, sand!</p><p><strong>X:</strong> What&#39;s next? Maybe a sand squall followed by a sand rainbow!?</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> A sand rainbow. What a lovely concept. How very unrealistic, yet sublime.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> But, unfortunately, this sandstorm is so cosmically big it&#39;s enveloping everything in Totooine&#39;s orbit.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> Dammit... We don&#39;t have time for this. We need to hurry!</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> Getting Du Stallion II get shot down and having to make an emergency landing on this planet was not part of the plan.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> I guess those reports that this area was getting unruly were true.</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Maybe we just should&#39;ve waited for Black Bucket to finish repairing the ship!?</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> First of all, he&#39;s not a black bucket. He&#39;s my Black Knight.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> Second, we can&#39;t wait that long. Not with...my precious...</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> ...sweet bean buns at stake!</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> I have to get to the Spacebucks that just opened on Totooine before they sell out of their special commemorative buns!</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Huh? Commemorative buns? What about our mission to dispatch that villain?</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> The special Spacebucks version of Totooine&#39;s famous Zero Buns comes first.</p><p><strong>X:</strong> What!? You never said anything about some stupid mission like that before!</p><p><strong>X:</strong> ...(Sigh) This explains why you were so excited about researching our destination...</p><p><strong>X:</strong> If only you worked half as hard to preserve peace in the Servantverse as you did on acquiring sweets...</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Huh!? Ex, get down!</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> Yikes.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Damn, I can&#39;t believe how accurate they are! Looks like we&#39;re up against more enemies than we thought!</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> That shadow over there... Is that a sand raider? One of Totooine&#39;s mythical desert people?</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> Now I see... So that&#39;s how it is.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> These sand raider extremists are trying to stop Spacebucks&#39; galactic expansion by any means necessary!</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Seriously!? Oh, hell no! I am NOT getting killed over freaking coffee milk!!!</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Good thing we can totally take these guys if we can just get in close! Let&#39;s get &#39;em, Ex!</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> Right. I won&#39;t let them stand in the way of peace...or of my sweet bean buns!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> These two weren&#39;t part of the plan. Guess I&#39;ve got no other choice...</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> We didn&#39;t learn this until much later...</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> ...but the incident on Totooine was just the opening act of a huge conspiracy.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> I still find it hard to believe that the legendary bounty hunter, Edgy Fett, was masterminding the whole thing...</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Even in my wildest dreams, I never would&#39;ve thought a guy that strong would be hiding out among the sand raiders...</p><p><strong>X:</strong> So we ended up letting him get away, failing the assignment, and having to stay behind for special training, AGAIN!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The legendary bounty hunter...</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong> Edgy Fett...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Short for Edgemiya Fett...</p><hr><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> That&#39;s right. They say he&#39;ll only work for enormous cash bounties, and that even the League of Villains fears him.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> There are also rumors that say he&#39;s the Alter of a certain hero, and that Edgy Fett is just a codename.</p><p><strong>X:</strong> It still burns me that we let him get away. If only Mr. Dual Pistols had been a Saber...</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> Anyway, our assignment might not have gone at all well...</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> ...but the important thing is that I managed to get my hands on the sweet buns in the end.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong> I see... At first, I thought this Cosmo-Chaldea High School was a place for raising defenders of justice...</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong> ...but it&#39;s actually a charity designed to try and give completely hopeless Servants a chance to be useful somehow.</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Nrghhh...</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Y-yes, I might not have had top grades, but so what!</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Their methods were never a good fit for my learning style anyway!</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Especially when it came to those smug-ass teachers!</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong> What a terrible tragedy for you.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong> So with your combined 2.0 GPA and your complete inability to work as a team, you were dispatched to different planets around the universe?</p><p><strong>X:</strong> That&#39;s right! Stupid Principal Lionhead made us go just to piss us off!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What sort of planets were you two sent to?</p><hr><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> They were all very dangerous, but the one I&#39;ll never forget...</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> ...is Planet Guntama... I could never forget it after what happened there.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Guntama? That name sounds familiar. Isn&#39;t that your home planet, X?</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Hehehe. You got it, Mash!</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> That&#39;s right. I latched on to X to mooch off her when she went back there during spring break.</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Not that I wanted to go back to my home planet or anything. Or for Ex to come with me in the first place.</p><p><strong>X:</strong> I would&#39;ve muuuch rather hung out at a different planet.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> But Guntama was the only place we were allowed to go after all the detentions we&#39;d incurred at school.</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Can you believe that!? Just thinking about it still makes me sooo angry!</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong> Ha ha ha ha. At least you still got to go on break.</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong> I&#39;d say that&#39;s better than nothing.</p><p><strong>X:</strong> It&#39;s not funny!</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Because of all that, I had to bring Ex along on a trip back home I never wanted to take to begin with.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><pre><code>	\u2013 Planet Guntama \u2013

What are you... S-stop that... Please, stop.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> M-my name is...Ex... I don&#39;t...go by that... Ngh...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Ex? Are you okay?</p><p><strong>Edgy Fett:</strong> I see. Looks like the brainwashing&#39;s stronger than I thought.</p><p><strong>Edgy Fett:</strong> But you still must have noticed how unstable you&#39;ve been since you came to this planet.</p><p><strong>Edgy Fett:</strong> That vision correction device you&#39;re wearing was made here on Esaba. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve already figured that out.</p><p><strong>Edgy Fett:</strong> But it was also illegally modified to maintain and reinforce your brainwashing.</p><p><strong>Edgy Fett:</strong> Since you got here, an identical frequency emitted from the planet&#39;s automated factory has been canceling out their modifications.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> Huh!? Reinforced brainwashing...? How do you know about this?</p><p><strong>Edgy Fett:</strong> My last client told me to be careful around you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> X Alter? Did you just remember something?</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> That&#39;s right... I... I wandered around space...before I came to Cosmo-Chaldea High School... Ngh...</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> Black Knight...some of your memories have been encrypted, right?</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> Maybe my memories have something to do with... (Gasp...gasp...)</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> Ahh... I&#39;m glad X isn&#39;t awake...to see me like this...</p><hr><p><strong>Edgy Fett:</strong> I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t have time for idle chatter.</p><p><strong>Edgy Fett:</strong> The League of Villains might have Lionhead&#39;s heroes in a tight spot right now...</p><p><strong>Edgy Fett:</strong> ...but it won&#39;t be long before the busybodies at the Galactic Police catch wind of this and stick their noses in.</p><p><strong>Edgy Fett:</strong> Sooner or later, Esaba&#39;s going down. I was just planning my escape route when you showed up.</p><p><strong>Edgy Fett:</strong> So, I&#39;ve got a proposal for you.</p><p><strong>Edgy Fett:</strong> Come with me, and I&#39;ll take you to see the League of Villains&#39; higher-ups.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> N-no...I won&#39;t! I&#39;m a student at...Cosmo-Chaldea High School...!</p><p><strong>X:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>X:</strong> (Ex&#39;s been acting weird ever since we landed on this planet. Going off on her own, being weirdly belligerent...)</p><p><strong>X:</strong> (At first I thought she just got up on the wrong side of the bed. But this explains what&#39;s been happening with her...)</p><p><strong>X:</strong> (...I don&#39;t get it one bit.)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (Heroine X...?)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (When did you wake up?)</p><hr><p><strong>X:</strong> (Whoa there. Keep it cool, Black Bucket, or you&#39;re gonna set off my ninja arts.)</p><p><strong>X:</strong> (I noticed someone was following us, so I was getting ready to fight back the moment they dropped their guard...)</p><p><strong>X:</strong> (But now, I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on.)</p><p><strong>X:</strong> (I was all set to punch Chief Red&#39;s fast and furious looking relative here in the face if he laid a hand on Ex...)</p><p><strong>X:</strong> (...but as much as it sucks, I&#39;m gonna have to wait and see how this plays out, thanks to these injuries.)</p><p><strong>Edgy Fett:</strong> ...Suit yourself. I&#39;ve done what I need to, so I&#39;m getting out of here.</p><p><strong>Edgy Fett:</strong> I just thought I might be able to cash in on a League of Villains reward. That&#39;s all.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> ...That&#39;s enough, bounty hunter. Please leave. Before X wakes up.</p><p><strong>Edgy Fett:</strong> ...Heh. Just don&#39;t go dying on me. Be a waste of a good bounty.</p><p><strong>Edgy Fett:</strong> ...Oh, I almost forgot.</p><p><strong>Edgy Fett:</strong> Since I lost my shot at an easy payday, I guess I might as well drop a little tidbit here...</p><p><strong>Edgy Fett:</strong> ...I wouldn&#39;t count on a wound from a Savage Queen&#39;s heavy spear getting better anytime soon.</p><p><strong>Edgy Fett:</strong> Not unless you&#39;ve got a way of undoing an anti-healing curse.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> What...? That can&#39;t be right!</p><p><strong>Edgy Fett:</strong> This passage leads to the center of the factory. Maybe it&#39;ll have something that can help a Servant heal faster.</p><p><strong>Edgy Fett:</strong> Assuming the defender Voloids don&#39;t get you first, of course.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> ...You&#39;re quite the busybody yourself, Edgy Fett.</p><p><strong>X:</strong></p><p>(I&#39;ll say!)</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> That&#39;s it...!</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> I can use this device to heal X.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> ...Huh? No, wait. This is...</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>X:</strong></p><p>(What? What is it? Now I really wanna know!)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Maybe it&#39;s about time you woke up?</p><hr><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> Dammit. They did see us coming in...!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Who dares disturb my factory&#39;s harmony?</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Damn, doesn&#39;t look like we&#39;ll be able to talk our way out of this one!</p><p><strong>X:</strong> But that&#39;s fine with me! If they want to fight, I&#39;ll take them all on!</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> X...!</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> You don&#39;t have to do this. That guy is probably this factory planet&#39;s manager, and he&#39;s really strong.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> Besides...I can&#39;t let your injuries get any worse.</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Don&#39;t be ridiculous, Ex! That&#39;s all the more reason to fight back!</p><p><strong>X:</strong> If I can beat this guy, I&#39;ll have academy credits for daaays! Then I&#39;ll be able to live it up and pig out every night until I graduate!</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> (Sigh)... I swear, you never change...</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> You might not have a lot going for you, X, but if nothing else, you don&#39;t want for bluster.</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Now you&#39;re talking trash about me!?</p><p><strong>X:</strong> I see. So you&#39;re planning to turn traitor! Well not on my watch, you aren&#39;t!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> If you wish to plead for your lives, intruders, you may do so in the depths of hell!</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> We weren&#39;t talking to you! Just shut up and give us a moment!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> You underestimate me at your own... Hm? Is that...?</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> Thank you, X.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> You once shared a freshly baked red bean bun with me.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> Now that I think of it, you&#39;ve always been giving me things, and you never once asked for anything in return.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> I&#39;ve always wanted to pay you back somehow.</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Huh? I forgot all about that, but...okay?</p><p><strong>X:</strong> H-hey, why so close? This...uh...this isn&#39;t really the time to hug it out, I don&#39;t think...</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> Got you.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> Black Knight, would you might dunking her, please?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Did you say dunk!? W-well, okay.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (Stuff Heroine X into the machine)</p><hr><p><strong>X:</strong> Huh? What&#39;re you\u2013Ow! Hey, quit shoving me... Gaaah!</p><p><strong>X:</strong> What&#39;s the big idea!? What&#39;s all this freezing cold slimy stuff!? Aah, I&#39;m gonna die, I&#39;m gonna die, I&#39;m gonna die!!!</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Ex, you traitor! You too, you overgrown bucket!</p><p><strong>H\uFF1AX (Frozen):</strong> ...</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> I can tell you&#39;re upset about this. I&#39;m sorry, X.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> I wish I&#39;d found something that could have healed you, but I couldn&#39;t.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> This is a flash-freezing device. It&#39;s called a Carbon Coffin.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> Even if I don&#39;t make it, I&#39;m sure someone from the school will find you, thaw you, and heal you.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> Even if the whole planet blows up, you should still be fine...I think.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> ...Okay, Black Knight. Send me my battle suit.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> On it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Don&#39;t you need to take off your glasses?</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong> These undulations... I knew it! It&#39;s Alternium!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> So you&#39;re the lost Dark R.O.U.N.D.S. successor.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> I might be destined to join the League of Villains one day.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> But that day...is not today.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...How dull. To think the Black Knight of the Round Table would be reduced to this.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Any pride you had in infiltrating the enemy side is gone. Now you are ruled entirely by fleeting emotion.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> You are a traitor to our cause.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Not even the notorious League of Villains would take someone who threw everything into such disorder back.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> You must be returned to them so that they can remind you of your place and put you back in it!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> You can start by becoming one of the parts that makes up the mechanisms of my factory, like a drive shaft, or a heat source, or a distributor.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> If you can&#39;t even do that...then die!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong> (Sniffle)... I see.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong> So the hero Servants were successful at bringing down Esaba and dealing a critical blow to the League of Villains.</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong> There are few things worse than a factory that makes evil robots. You did the right thing. The heroic thing.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So Planet Esaba was destroyed in an explosion caused by the gravity fields colliding.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> And X and Ex were saved by freezing themselves in a Carbon Coffin.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Phew... Talk about a close call!</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> Yes, it was. Oh, but we still wouldn&#39;t have made it back without Black Knight.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> If it wasn&#39;t for his distress beacon, we would have been forever lost in the vacuum of space like so much debris.</p><p><strong>X:</strong> I guess the reason I can&#39;t remember all that must be a side effect of the Coffin&#39;s freezing process...</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong> Beep boop... (I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s not how it works...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Hmm... Hm?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What is it, Senpai? Is there something strange about what she said?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It almost feels like my own memories don&#39;t quite match what we just heard...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Really? That must be a very odd sensation. Maybe it&#39;s a kind of d\xE9j\xE0 vu?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What makes you say that?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I, um, I guess it&#39;s just my Shielder Sense...?</p><hr><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> (Staaare)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (...Ex is looking at me veeery intently.)</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Are you sure everything is okay, Senpai?</p><p><strong>Mecha Eli-chan:</strong> Perhaps all this Servantverse information is memetically corrupting [\u2642 his /\u2640\uFE0F her} mind...?</p><p><strong>X:</strong> You were definitely nodding off a bit there, Master. Get it together, will you?</p><p><strong>Heroine XX:</strong> Yeah, for real, Mas\u2013 I mean, yes, you must do better.</p><p><strong>X:</strong> I knew there was something suspicious about her!</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> Heh heh. ...Shh. Let&#39;s just keep it our little secret.</p><p><strong>--FLASHBACK--:</strong></p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> This place won&#39;t hold much longer.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> But the battle seems to be going well. I guess the principal&#39;s team must have handled it.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> Huh? You found another Carbon Coffin? Great job, Black Knight.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> Although... The thing is, that device needs a lot of careful adjustments.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> There wasn&#39;t any time for this with X, but someone&#39;s usually supposed to stay behind and operate it from the outside.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> If it&#39;s not handled properly, it can also lead to issues with memory retention....</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> Huh? You can handle those adjustments no problem? And you can even do it from inside the Coffin?</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> ...Hmm, I see. That would be perfect.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> ...Yeah, you&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> I&#39;m sure we don&#39;t have much time left...</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> ...but I hope fate allows me just a little more.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> May the Alternium be with you...</p>`,468),a=[s];function g(i,h){return e(),o("div",null,a)}var l=t(r,[["render",g],["__file","Mysterious Heroine X Alter.html.vue"]]);export{l as default};
