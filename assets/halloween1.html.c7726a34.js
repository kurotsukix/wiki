I know you just woke up, but an invitation has arrived for you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Here you go. The envelope is traditional looking, and extremely formal.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> There&#39;s no return address on it but clearly this is Senpai&#39;s name on the envelope.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> From the heading, it appears to be an invitation to a Halloween party.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Halloween! Is it already that time?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. It is, indeed, that russet-colored season now. In Japan, it&#39;s the time for viewing autumn foliage.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What&#39;s Halloween?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You&#39;re not familiar with it?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It was originally a year&#39;s end celebration in Celtic culture, but it changed over time to become All Hallow&#39;s Eve...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s now a celebration put on the night before people offer up prayers to saints.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Though, I haven&#39;t actually experienced a Halloween celebration...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The bigger problem is the invitation itself, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I happened to overhear your conversation. A Halloween celebration, you say?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Sounds fun! I love festive events like that! Back when the Director was with us, she would never approve such things...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...That&#39;s [\u2642 kinda /\u2640 a little] inappropriate, Doctor.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Oh... I guess it was. Sorry, that was my bad. I&#39;ll be more careful from now on.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The Doctor didn&#39;t mean any harm, Senpai. Words just never go through his brain, as usual.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I feel absolutely ashamed... The greatest flaw of a science otaku is the utter lack of delicacy.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I really need to spend more time paying my respects to the late Director. This time I will put more time and emotion into it...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> The Director is still alive.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Huh?! She&#39;s alive?! Ah, I see. You mean she lives in our heart.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> After all, I feel the same way.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I never fail to clean the Director&#39;s Office, and I make daily offerings with her favorite dried fruit.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> You know what, I think that tonight, I&#39;ll put up some pumpkin decorations in the Director&#39;s Office.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Although, Olga Marie never admits when she likes something. She&#39;ll probably say something like, \u201CWhat are these useless things?!\u201D</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...Okay, I need to stop. It&#39;s a celebration, and here I am dampening the mood with my talk.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Ahem! All right, let&#39;s turn this mood around\u2014</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> But really, Fujimaru! You&#39;re a smooth one, scoring an invitation like that!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Who could it be from? I certainly don&#39;t recall sending you that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I didn&#39;t send it either, Doctor. But if neither you nor I sent it, that means...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Undoubtedly, this is some kind of mischief. After all, letters from the outside world can&#39;t be delivered here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> In any case, Senpai, let&#39;s read the invitation.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Please rest assured that it is free of razor blades or any other dangerous items.</p><p><strong>Letter:</strong> Dear Fujimaru, I am writing to inform you of a splendid Halloween party that is to take place.</p><p><strong>Letter:</strong> My little Castle Csejte is now completely remodeled!</p><p><strong>Letter:</strong> You&#39;ll be swallowed up in classic and dragonic decor\u2606</p><p><strong>Letter:</strong> I hereby humbly invite you to a dream-like night of elegance and wonder.</p><p><strong>Letter:</strong> At the party, you will find splendid pumpkin cuisine from the four corners of the world,</p><p><strong>Letter:</strong> as well as a splendid serenade from an adorable idol, a sweet serenade from a young girl that will set your heart on fire,</p><p><strong>Letter:</strong> and a serenade that&#39;s sung by an unparalleled diva. It all awaits you.</p><p><strong>Letter:</strong> Indeed, it shall be a grand ball that could set any soul alight. It will surely sink its teeth into your heart and savor it as well.</p><p><strong>Letter:</strong> Both your mind and body will have a deluxing experience! Won&#39;t you come and bask in the spectacular sensation of being mired in a nightmare?</p><p><strong>Letter:</strong> The theme is, \u201CSweet Blood M\xE4rchen Torture.\u201D I eagerly await your attendance.</p><p><strong>Letter:</strong> \u2014Be sure to come, okay?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> That is horrible!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The fact that she emphasizes singing three times seems unbearably sinister to me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Senpai, what shall we do?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> This \u201Cdeluxing\u201D is supposed to be \u201Crelaxing,\u201D isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You&#39;re right. I wonder if she wrote it out of excitement or if she didn&#39;t know what she was saying.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> So this \u201Ctorture\u201D bit is...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> She really means \u201Ctorture.\u201D To translate it accurately, it would be \u201CSweet, blood-covered, fairy tale-like, and torturous.\u201D</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> There&#39;s no signature on the invitation, but... Based on the content of the note, I have a good idea who sent it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A Servant who loves to sing... Loves to daydream... And also enjoys blood and torture. It could only be...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Elisabeth...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> B\xE1tho...</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> No, you must not utter another syllable. To speak her name is to summon her, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Just as speaking the truth isn&#39;t always the best idea, spotting a disaster before it happens doesn&#39;t necessarily mean you can prevent it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So\u2014precisely what are you trying to say, Doctor?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Well... If you can&#39;t avoid a dangerous situation, it&#39;s easier to charge in without a second thought!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> That philosophy has gotten me through most problems or troubles that I&#39;ve encountered.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fooooooou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Let&#39;s just ignore Doctor&#39;s advice. He doesn&#39;t understand human emotion whatsoever...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Senpai. Are you planning to respond to the invitation?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;ve...never experienced an event of this kind, so I am interested, I suppose...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Oh, the residual Spiritron information on this letter indicates its point of origin.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> You could go anytime you want... So what will you do, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Mash, let&#39;s go to the party together!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Of course! I look forward to your guidance and support!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> As a matter of fact, I happen to love pumpkins.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Oh dear, you&#39;re not very honest, are you? But, if you love pumpkins so much, I suppose you&#39;d better go.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> She seems to have gathered some good materials. I&#39;ll join you as well.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Then let&#39;s head out to the theme park of our dreams - a Halloween party!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Um. We should bring lunch with us, shouldn&#39;t we?</p><h2 id="section-1-haunted-forest" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-haunted-forest" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 1: Haunted Forest</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We&#39;ve arrived. The time period is unknown but the location appears to be somewhere in Europe.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That said... It feels both a bit frightening and yet fun, somehow. How odd.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> There are jack-o&#39;-lanterns hanging all over the place, and all the skeletons are dancing about.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fooou! Fa!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It&#39;s a much grander setup than I imagined... Perhaps I underestimated her...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes... Since this is Miss Ba...ry we&#39;re talking about, I thought she&#39;d be more of a paper decorations kind of girl...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Seems like we might need to pay extra attention here.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;m picking up some weak hostile signatures here and there. There&#39;s no telling what could happen here. Be on your guard as you investigate.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Right, this was totally unexpected, so it&#39;s sure to be more than we bargained for!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Now, let&#39;s go, Master!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> All that glitters isn&#39;t gold, but when in Rome, do as the Romans do, they say!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Leave it there... Leave it there... Leave some AP or stones and stuff there...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Hmmph! So a ghost-type is the first up, I see... How typical.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s far from surprising, but well, I suppose it is what it is. It&#39;s the most basic of basics in a haunted house scenario.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> On second thought, this could be fun. Senpai, quickly now! It&#39;s time for some ghost-busting!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m not picking up any more enemies nearby. Those must&#39;ve just been some strays.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I suppose that&#39;s the quality of enemies you get right at the entrance. We need to find the real deal as soon as possible\u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um, shouldn&#39;t we head toward that totally suspicious-looking castle over there, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That castle... An evil castle of blood... Ugh, my head!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fooou...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I understand how you feel. Do you need a tranquilizer?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You&#39;re in high spirits, aren&#39;t you, Mash?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, absolutely! Uh, I mean... Of course I am, since this is our work and all.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I wasn&#39;t hoping it would be like going to a real theme park or anything, um, definitely not!</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Huh? ...Hmmm... That&#39;s odd. Maybe this gauge is broken...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Doctor? In your professional opinion, did you notice something odd about that ghost just now?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Eh, not really. It was probably my imagination. Just forget it.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> (A nearby tremor in the Singularity... Really. It couldn&#39;t be. Hmmm, I&#39;ll just pretend I didn&#39;t see anything.)</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> You kids just go on enjoying yourselves. You&#39;d best head to the castle first, like the invitation said.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Of course we will! Let&#39;s head for the pumpkin village just beyond the forest!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Eh heh heh, eh heh heh heh heh... Eh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I... ...&#39;ve?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> fo... ...und</p><p><strong>???:</strong> you \u2606</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> ...Fou?

If you like, we could pause here for a moment to rest.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That sounds good.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> All right then. Doctor, we&#39;re going to take a short break.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It&#39;d be nice to eat some pumpkin pie.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> !!! Good thinking, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> As good as being chosen by Weekly Halloween Magazine to receive the title of \u201CThis Autumn&#39;s Number One Master,\u201D maybe?</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Hmmm, I&#39;m not detecting any enemies near you. Looks like you should be able to relax for a bit.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> All right, it&#39;s time for our homemade lunch then. Here&#39;s to our super lunchtime!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> My, how valiant. In that case, shall I lay out a blanket to sit on?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ah, good idea. Please do.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> There you are, Master. Please have a seat. Here, these are homemade grilled rice balls.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Thanks.</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> And here is some tea.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s delicious!</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Oh, you&#39;re too kind...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> By the way...</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Yes? What is it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What are you doing here?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Now that you mention it... Why are you here, Kiyohime?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fofooooou!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Oh my, I would&#39;ve thought one&#39;s wife would naturally always be at one&#39;s side.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> I went to the trouble of hiding for him in a box tied with a bow, but my silly husband is just so indifferent.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Then he went and fell for that unspeakably shady invitation. As your loving wife, I couldn&#39;t sit by and do nothing.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> How odd. Somehow, it feels as though the words I&#39;m hearing and the actual written words are fatally irreconcilable.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> And that, basically, is why I&#39;ve come here. Fear not, I shall guard you flawlessly.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Yes, 24 hours a day, from head to toe, from all directions, without a second&#39;s hesitation.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Go on now, let the fanfare sound! For \u201CKiyohime is now your wife!\u201D</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Thanks for your continued support.</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Ohhh, you&#39;re so cold! But it&#39;s part of your charm, eh heh heh heh heh...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Well, I&#39;m overwhelmed with anxiety for your future, but what do you think, Mash?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> For once, I&#39;m actually in agreement with you, Doctor...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Oh my, it seems something is nearby. Now then, Master, let us hold hands and go forth on a \u201Choneymoon.\u201D</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That was way too forced.</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Tee-hee\u2606</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> I might or might not have heard about skulls being used as wonder drugs...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Master, would you care to use one?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Absolutely not.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> No, thank you.</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> I suppose not. Shall we depart?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> Heh, heh, heh... It seems my next guest has finally come.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> Hee, hee, hee, the next guest is no one special. All the most important guests seem to have arrived.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> Which is why this will be my very first and last love song. Hmm, how melancholy.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> However, I doubt this is the last fool to come. Oh fleeting Master, shall I just call you Oxygen?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> Oxy... What? Truly, you say the strangest things sometimes...</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> Anyways, even if this is both my first and last, that makes it all the more real for little ol&#39; me!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> All the preparations are complete for me to make my grand entrance, right?</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> Leave it to me, the food&#39;s all cooked! It&#39;s my seven-spice blend chicken-turkey! It&#39;s delicious!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> Impressive... I hired you under the exaggerated boast that you were an all-powerful maid, but it seems you actually are all-powerful...</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> Ah, but little ol&#39; me will handle the main dish. Be sure to leave some for me.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> Le...Leave that? Severed...meal? And... What meat now? Stop using all these hard words, you lizard.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> But somehow, I understood it all. It&#39;s my habit to eat every bit of my breakfast. Namu Amida Butsu.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> Namu... What?</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> It&#39;s a fancy phrase in Japan.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> I use it to mean, \u201CPlease forgive my brutality and depravity, for I am naught but a brutish beast.\u201D</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> ...You&#39;re pretty knowledgeable sometimes, you know...</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> Well, anyways. Has everyone been dispatched?</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> Good to go. Surrounded on all sides. You&#39;ll wait here with all the grace of a proper castle master, won&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> Yes, that way I can enjoy this banquet to the fullest.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> Wait, I do have some free time after all... Maybe little ol&#39; me ought to go and meet them too?</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> Hmm, I&#39;ll kill you then?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> I-I was just joking! Joking!

No... I was just wondering if that was the right term...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> By the way, the original Japanese for husband means \u201Ca person who looks after you,\u201D so I think it&#39;s okay to use for either a man or a woman.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Isn&#39;t that great, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> No, no, no.</p><hr><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> La-la-lah\u266A</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> It&#39;s a lovely night, isn&#39;t it everyone?

If I can get my hands on it...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Fufufufufufu!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fo\u2014u!</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong> ...I know I can&#39;t be one to talk, but don&#39;t you think she&#39;s as dangerous as the fireworks outside?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Hahaha. She&#39;s more of a landmine than a firework.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Silence, you.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> So far, I&#39;ve been playing tourist, but now my goal has changed.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> I&#39;m going to defeat the mistress of this castle and get the Grail. You&#39;re okay with that, right, my husband?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (Shakes head in a certain direction.)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (Shakes head in a certain direction.)</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Oh my! You&#39;re so happy you shook your head both up and down AND side to side.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Enough talking, then.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> You, Servant whose name I don&#39;t know. Will you lead us to the mistress of this castle?</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong> You think I will? I, Carmilla the Vampire?</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong> My role is to entertain the guests. Now\u2014enjoy this blood-freezing terror!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong> That concludes my warm-up. Glad to see you have spirit, pigs.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong> After I&#39;ve brought you to your knees, I&#39;ll collar you and keep you as pets.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong> Of course, as my slaves you&#39;ll have to clean for me!</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong> Now, are you ready? I&#39;ll use my Phantom Maiden to paint the walls with your blood!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um, wouldn&#39;t that just make an even bigger mess?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong> Grr... That stupid dragon girl with her songs and dancing... No true noble would do such a thing...</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong> Hehehe, but perhaps this is for the best... Oh, I&#39;m about to...</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong> GYAN!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> No slacking off from your cleaning by playing dead.</p><p><strong>Carmilla:</strong> (Sob, sob...)</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> So the dragon girl&#39;s got the Grail, huh? I wonder what she wished for.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Well, I can guess.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> I see. So both Mata Hari and Carmilla have fallen. Are the little [\u2642 Puppies /\u2640 Deerlets] suffering?</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> Of course. Life itself is suffering. Most people are always suffering.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> But at the same time, most suffering can be alleviated with the softness of a paw, or perhaps a tail.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> In other words, they don&#39;t suffer that much at all. By the way, do we have enough carrot cake?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> \u2013I see. Then make them suffer more. More cruelty! More despair!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> That&#39;s the most important part of this Halloween party!</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> First I&#39;ve heard of it, but sure thing!

Or perhaps not.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Very well then. I grant you the honor of fighting with Vlad Tepes, the Dracul.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Oh my. We actually ran into a serious warrior for once. Class-wise, he&#39;s the same as me, though.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Of course, no Berserker can rival me in elegance and breeding.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> You make me laugh, man-eater. Your sin will scorch you from within.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Both you and I have trod a wicked path. Know that neither of us shall return to the light.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> ...That kind of ticked me off. You will pay dearly for that.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Of course. This is a banquet, a place for entertainment! And so\u2014</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Even the jesters must give it their all.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> As the ruler of a nation, I know the importance of festivals. Man needs circuses as well as bread.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Wow... He&#39;s so serious! He&#39;s the one person who doesn&#39;t get the mood for this event!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> In a sense, he&#39;s a true Berserker... The only sane man in a world of the insane.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> \u2014I find that a touch rude. I consider myself a gentleman with a sense of humor.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Mata Hari&#39;s dance was one of mirth. Carmilla&#39;s dance was one of suffering.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> I would like to add a dance of my own, a dance of blood...</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> But I must beg your forgiveness. I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m much better at embroidery.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Embroidery? Your hobby is embroidery?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Did you make that splendid regalia yourself?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Hahaha! How kind of you, milady. But no, this was the work of a special tailor.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> I wanted to try my hand at it myself, but I had my position to think of.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Young girl, if you like, I shall give you a lesson later.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> An applique of a praying man would decorate your master&#39;s clothes well.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Vlad!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> But first, we must attend to the battle. I&#39;ve been asked to \u201Chype up this party,\u201D you see.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> And the best way to liven up this banquet, I believe\u2013 Is with your screams.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Let us begin with an appetizer. Eat, as your bones scream in pain!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Indeed, banquets are splendid. It was worth going along with that girl.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> ...So it&#39;s \u201Cthat girl\u201D after all?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Of course. Out of all Servants, there are few who could spread such sweet delusions without shame.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> No, I think there are probably a lot...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Well, I&#39;m sure there&#39;s plenty...</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Oh my... Master. Your passionate gaze... It&#39;s making me blush.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> No, this isn&#39;t such a simple matter.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Even with the Grail&#39;s power, for a Servant to summon another Servant...</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Be not afraid, foreign mage. We simply\u2014answered the summons ourselves.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> What she found was only a tiny sliver of the Grail. It lacks the power to incinerate eras.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> She probably found it by chance during your battles at Orleans.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> It must be the blessing of God that it was entrusted to the most harmless Servant there.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> ...She doesn&#39;t seem harmless to me.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> She has the mind of a child.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> She&#39;s a very immature Servant who takes her childish thoughts and makes them real.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> She acts neither for good nor evil, nor for dreams or greed. She simply seeks her own entertainment.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> ...But that&#39;s why it is fine. Her entertainment is a pure joy, unlike ours.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> I know of it myself. Before I became the dragon who defended my nation, I, too, was once a father.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Now, it&#39;s time for me to fight for real.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> My stakes have found their place in history. And now you shall feel their wrath!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> ...Hmmph. Enough, I suppose.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...He&#39;s barely scratched, isn&#39;t he?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I can&#39;t believe I survived that.</p><hr><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Of course. I&#39;m the only one who&#39;s being serious here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I was serious as well!</p><hr><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Splendid, splendid. My work here is finished.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Now then... Keep playing along until the end.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> She seemed so worried about whether or not you would come.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Oh dear. You&#39;re much nicer than you look. Sure you&#39;re not related?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> ...I&#39;m simply taking pity on a comrade. It&#39;s harder than you think, always being called a vampire.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Whew, I&#39;m so tired... And my throat is parched, too.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> My husband, would you happen to have any cough drops?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Here you go.</p><hr><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Thank you!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> We&#39;re giving each other cough drops now... We&#39;re practically married!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I wouldn&#39;t say that. I&#39;m the one who provided that cough drop.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> I see... A pity.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Either way, so far we&#39;ve dealt with Mata Hari, Carmilla, and Vlad III.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> That&#39;s quite a few, but there might be more Servants who wish to join in on all the fuss...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> There&#39;s one thing I know for sure.</p><hr><p><strong>Both:</strong> \u2013?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;ve got a bad feeling about this.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Same here...</p><h2 id="section-6-hyper-enthusiastic-maid-cat" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-6-hyper-enthusiastic-maid-cat" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 6: Hyper Enthusiastic Maid Cat</h2><p><strong>Tamamo Cat:</strong> RAAAAWWRRR!
