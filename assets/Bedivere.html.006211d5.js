I shall accompany you, no matter your destination.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> Rayshifting? Perhaps training in the simulator?</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> After all, I am here on behalf of Miss Mash today. I will try my very best to be of help to you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Wait, what&#39;s wrong with Mash?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Now that you mention it...</p><hr><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> Miss Mash is having her medical check today. I understand she must remain in the exam room all day.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> Medical checks are important. As you are aware, Chaldea is isolated from the rest of the world, and located in an extreme environment.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> Our bodies and minds are under incredible pressure... We must always be aware of this.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> Of course, we face the unprecedented threat that is the Incineration of Humanity.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> And while the flames we face and the biting cold of Chaldea&#39;s environment are quite different in nature...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> They can both be said to be exceptionally difficult environments.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> That is the challenge that everyone here in Chaldea faces. Yourself included, Master.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> As such, frequent checkups are of critical importance. Understood?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Okay!</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> Very good. A most excellent response.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Thanks for looking out for me.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> ...Your words humble me.</p><hr><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> Permit me to remind you once more: I am here as a substitute for Miss Mash today.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> As such, please ask me for anything. I am your attendant, your butler. I am your Servant today in every possible sense of the word.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> How about training in the simulator? Or observing and monitoring the remnants from the Singularities would be appropriate as well.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> ...Battling to gain something is what will lead to further growth for you, Master.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> Battles for the sake of the Grand Order...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> Or rather, battles to continue your survival, will eventually wear you down.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> Your soul. Your psyche. Or speaking in modern terms, your nerves.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Nerves wearing down...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Modern terms? That&#39;s more of a medical term.</p><hr><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> There is one thing that crossed my mind, Master.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> Normally, I wouldn&#39;t dare mention something like this to others...but in your particular case...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> I&#39;m sure HE would be happy about it, without a doubt. He is that kind of knight.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> While any such approval given would be...ex post facto, unworthy though I am, I shall eventually gain it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> He?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> When you said knight...?</p><hr><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> Yes. Actually...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> My comrade, the man who is the epitome of freedom, Sir Tristan, heads out to a certain place in every free moment he has.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> Occasionally, I accompany him. I believe it is a wonderful place to relax.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> But please, keep that to yourself...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I will!</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> Thank you very much.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Where is it? The Rec room?</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> Haha. Is that where you think it is?</p><hr><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> Let&#39;s head over there right away. I will leave a note for Sir Tristan.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> Let&#39;s go!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> The sea...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> So it&#39;s not outside, but in the simulator.</p><hr><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> You&#39;re less enthused than expected... My apologies...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> Perhaps I built up your expectations too much... I must reflect on my presentation.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> As you can see, this is a virtual creation in the simulator. We are not actually outside Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> Still, it gives me a sense of peace. I hope it works for you as well, Master.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> Initially, even I was skeptical about whether or not this would work.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> I accompanied Sir Tristan to watch him go fishing and listen to his ranting that was nothing but difficult to understand...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> There was nothing in particular to do except to spend time just watching the sky and sea.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> But...surprisingly, doing so felt peaceful, or rather, it calmed me.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> And I wanted you to experience that same sense of peace, or at least calming effect.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> ...Have I...overstepped my boundaries?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> No, taking a break sometimes is nice.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> No. Let&#39;s relax together, Bedivere.</p><hr><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> Thank you, Master.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> Then...how about this? Would you like to try night fishing?</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> Sir Tristan uses his Failnaught so skillfully to catch a great many fish.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Darn, we don&#39;t have fishing gear.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> Ah, but we do. I had Miss Da Vinci prepare us some.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> In that much, I planned ahead. I am excited to provide you with the best fishing experience ever.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Don&#39;t we need to have entered that data beforehand?</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> Do not fret. I requested Miss Da Vinci&#39;s help on that front.</p><hr><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> I believe I open up the multipurpose window...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> Now I equip the extra item...and we&#39;re all set.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> Well, I&#39;m sure there are other ways to do so, but I don&#39;t have as much experience with the simulator...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> I understand Miss Jing Ke is quite well-versed in such things. She even brings things like alcohol with her, I am told.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> But let&#39;s do it this way for today. After you, Master.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> The bait is already on the hook, so please cast it out to sea with all your might.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Hi-yah!</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> Wonderful. Excellent, Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Arraaaghh!</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> Such bold and brazen movement...! Amazing!</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> Wonderful! Have you by chance tried fishing before?</p><hr><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> And now...the main event.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> Well, there is nothing special to do now. At night, when the boundaries between the sky and sea are blurred, we just listen to the waves...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> And please relax. There&#39;s no need to feel rushed or impatient.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> Please, sit back and enjoy this leisure time. I will watch your line, so please do not worry.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> ...This is something that I&#39;ve never said before...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> Nor did Tristan say this...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> But at times, I find myself thinking this:</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> Tristan was torn between the two Iseults. And his fate led him to lose his life by the water.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> Or rather, his soul...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> Perhaps that is why he cannot be apart from the water. Even now, he could be waiting for that ship with the shining, pale white sail...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Bedivere, tell me a story.</p><hr><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> ...Shh, Master. Empty your thoughts...your mind.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> I am not saying you must enter an Eastern meditative state. Just...let yourself go. Calm. Peace.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> Just watch the boundaries of the sea and sky to melt together, and doze into the blanket of night...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> Let your daily stresses wash away.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> !!!</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> Something&#39;s biting! It&#39;s splashing!</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> It must be a big one...! It&#39;s like Sir Kay swimming amongst the fishes!</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> This may be even bigger than that! I&#39;ve never seen such an intense tug on a fishing line!</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> It could be a red snapper, mackerel, or even a tuna!</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> Let&#39;s reel it in, Master!</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> Just like humans take pictures of fish to record their greatest catches, we can capture its data and show it off to Miss Mash and Sir Tristan!</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> It&#39;s sure to make them smile!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Okay, let&#39;s do this!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Reeeeeel!</p><hr><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> !!!</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> You did it! The fish just popped out of the sea!</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> ...That&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> The fish we caught is...actually, not a fish...</p><p><strong>Fish?:</strong> Gueeeeeeeeeaaahhh!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What the hell is this!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It&#39;s an enemy!</p><hr><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> Oh I&#39;m so embarrassed...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> I must have made some kind of mistake when I set up the system. Doing something one is unaccustomed to can cause such trouble...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> I pulled an all-nighter studying the manual...but I am no good at learning new things...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> No, now&#39;s not the time for lamentations! Master, your commands!</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> I am prepared to make amends for my misconduct. Or, rather, I am prepared to accept whatever punishment you deem fitting. But first, we have an enemy to fight!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1ABedivere:</strong> I swear by my Airgetl\xE1m that I will dispose of this immediately!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Of course! Let&#39;s do this, Bedivere!</p><hr><p><strong>C\uFF1ABedivere:</strong> Switch On - Airgetl\xE1m!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>B\uFF1ABedivere:</strong> Dead End, Airgetl\xE1m!</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> Please, allow me to apologize once more.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> Even thought it was only in the simulator, my most important job is to keep you safe...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> It appears my efforts were fruitless once again...I&#39;m sorry, Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> There is nothing to forgive, Bedivere.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Nobody got hurt, so no problem.</p><hr><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> Thank you very much. I am undeserving of such kindness.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> Now...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> It would be a waste to leave this, so let&#39;s eat it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Pardon?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I don&#39;t really understand.</p><hr><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> I have memories from my previous life. For instance, from Round Table analects, King Arthur, number eight:</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> \u201CFood is all the same. Nutrition is nutrition, even monster meat!\u201D</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> Now, Master...repeat!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Oh right...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Bedivere&#39;s kind of crazy like that!</p><hr><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> What are you talking about? Master? Why are you backing away? Master!?</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> ...Once again, my apologies.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> But I&#39;m glad. You cleaned your plate completely. Now that I&#39;ve learned more about your food preferences...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> In order for you to enjoy my dishes more in the future, I will continue to hone my skills.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> By the way...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Where are we...?</p><hr><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> The seaside we visited is Sir Tristan&#39;s place of relaxation. Now we are at mine.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> It&#39;s quite similar to a certain place in Britain.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> A place of peace... Well, admittedly this tranquil place is where I allow my mind to race.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> It is a place that helps me renew my resolve and reinvigorate my soul. So it may be a stretch to call this place a place of peace.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Bedivere?</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Care to share?</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> ...Yes, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> Our Britain was a nation under constant threat of attack, never peaceful or stable.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> Many fell victim to that strife, and I could do nothing to save them.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> The Giant of Mont Saint-Michel. A fearsome giant was wreaking havoc on Mont Saint-Michel of Brittany...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> ...and kidnapped Princess Helena, the niece of the King of Brittany.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> Our King Arthur took Sir Kay and myself to hunt the giant down and rescue her.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> On that quest...to be honest...I was of no help to the two of them.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> King Arthur and Sir Kay defeated the giant in a gruesome battle and brought some peace to Brittany.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> On the other hand, I...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> ...I could not save the princess.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> I was too late, powerless as I am. All too little, too late.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> Princess Helena, known for her grace, had her young and promising life plucked away, and we found only her pitiful corpse.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> I couldn&#39;t save the people dear to me.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> First, Princess Helena. Then, the Battle of Camlann, my king...Arthur...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> I failed...not once, but twice...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Bedivere...</p><hr><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> ...This place...it reminds me of where Princess Helena drew her last breath.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> Every time I stand here, it reminds me...that I am a powerless knight.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> I am but a man who lost the two people he swore to protect.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> This is the place where I vowed never to repeat those mistakes. Ever.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> Master, I am a weak, powerless man who does not deserve to be numbered among the Knights of the Round Table.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> And yet\u2013No, because of that, I offer you this vow, knowing that my manifestation here was truly a miracle:</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> I shall protect you, Master, who fights these brutal battles to defend humanity&#39;s future.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> No matter how powerful our coming enemies may be...no matter how cruel the fate we face may be...</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> Your life...your heart...your body... I shall protect you till the very end.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Thank you, Sir Bedivere.</p><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> ...Yes, Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I believe you.</p><hr><p><strong>Bedivere:</strong> I swear that I will live up to your expectations, Fujimaru.</p>',242),i=[n];function a(p,g){return t(),r("div",null,i)}var d=e(s,[["render",a],["__file","Bedivere.html.vue"]]);export{d as default};
