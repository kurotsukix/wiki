Isn&#39;t that...?</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> Hellooo, Medusa. Quit spacing out.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> That tea is way beyond steeped. We don&#39;t want bitter tea!</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> You&#39;re right. The moment of tea perfection has already passed. If only you were the normal Medusa...</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> She may be gangly and graceless, but at least she never missed the right time to pour the tea.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> You should be more mindful of your size. Some things you can&#39;t do on speed alone.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> My apologies, big older sister, little older sister. I was too focused on the hourglass...</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> Here is your tea. Little older sister prefers one scoop of sugar, correct?</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> Yes. Just a bit...only a little bit...</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> That will be enough, Medusa. We shall have our tea.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong></p><p>...Hey, what IS this!? This tastes terrible!</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> You mustn&#39;t be so harsh, me. Our younger sister is doing her best.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> Then again, it is truly disgusting. The problem isn&#39;t how it was made, but that she used bad tea leaves.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> Medusa. Where did you get this tea from?</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> I-I&#39;m terribly sorry! I used a pretty golden can that I found in the reception room.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> I see. At least you took some minimal effort. But if you want to find good tea, go to the doctor&#39;s clinic.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> That man stashes away good Chinese tea. You should also learn how to properly prepare tea from him.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> I hate Chinese tea. You can only mix honey with it! ...I-I mean...</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> If you are to steep black tea, you should use soft water that&#39;s free of minerals. Why in the world did you decide to use hard water, Medusa?</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> ...Um, was that bad?</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> I thought it was for the best to splurge on mineral water...</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> Mineral water!? What a terrible rookie mistake, even for you, Medusa!</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> You must go to Japan. Japan! You shall learn about soft water, and the proper essential rules for preparing black tea there!</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> ...I see. Please forgive me for being so ignorant...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...It appears the sisters are having tea.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Whenever the young Medusa is with us...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...she seems so mature and composed...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But watching her right now, she seems to be acting her age, or at least the age she appears to be.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Although...</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> Oh, it&#39;s Master and Mash. Are you here because you missed us so?</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> So much that even a brief moment apart is agony? Teehee, you are so cute, Master.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> Oh...hello, Master, Mash.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...They weren&#39;t bullying you, were they?</p><hr><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> N-no, absolutely not. This is all because of how immature I am!</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> And...actually, I&#39;m a little happy about...this. There&#39;s no problem.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...?</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> To tell you the truth, it took a very long time for me to be able to speak to my sisters, even after I was summoned to Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> Until now, all I could do was watch from afar...because I was scared.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> I was created by an irregularity in history.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> I&#39;m here as a product of a miraculous coincidence and humanity&#39;s warped timeline...</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> I am the Medusa who is not an Anti-Hero...someone who should never have existed in the first place.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> And I had no idea how my older sisters would react when they saw me.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> I wouldn&#39;t have known what to do had they ignored me, or if they said I was not their younger sister...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> Oh, please don&#39;t look so glum, Master.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> It turned out that I was worrying needlessly.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> My older sisters call me by my name and treat me as their younger sister.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> And that...makes me happy.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I-I see... Um, if I may point out...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Since Stheno and Euryale are goddesses...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...we know that they have a tendency to be very...intense and often make impossible requests...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> And, well, when it comes to their treatment of Medusa... Um, it seems they don&#39;t really hold back when it comes to their own family...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Sometimes it&#39;s painful to see what unfolds...</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> Family members...I see...</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But perhaps it&#39;s all right if Medusa doesn&#39;t mind...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> We should intervene if it goes too far.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Different things make different people happy...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You&#39;re...right...</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> Hellooo! How much longer are you two going to be whispering over there!?</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> Mash, Master, would you two like some tea? I&#39;ll have to warn you that it will be a poor cup of tea prepared by our failure of a younger sister.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> I will prepare it right away. Please wait a minute.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> You really are impossible, Medusa. Get us some new snacks, too. I know there are some on top of the cabinet over there.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> We cannot possibly reach them ourselves, frail and delicate as we are, but you&#39;re a huge woman whose nickname was Big Mountain of the Shapeless Isle...</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> Um, I&#39;ll need to borrow this step stool...</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> And stack these boxes...</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> (Huff...puff...) Reeeach...got it!</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> You know, thinking on it, I believe we stored a cookie jar under the floor.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> But, Medusa, be careful of that enormous body of yours. You might get stuck down there if you so much as stretch your arms or legs.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> Here, right? I can&#39;t reach, so I&#39;ll just crawl under to find it... (Rummage, rummage) ...Whew. I found it.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> ...Is something the matter?</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> ...Agh! This is so frustrating!</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> Why is this Medusa so small!?</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> ...I wonder. This form...it seems to be how I was before Athena cursed me.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> It&#39;s frustrating that I&#39;m so young and powerless, but...</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> ...I am still happy.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> I didn&#39;t get to spend much time with my sisters in this form, you see...</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> Having a chance to spend time with them like this is so new to me...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I see. I know that Medusa was concerned that her form is an irregular one...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But it appears that it&#39;s not all bad.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> Happy, you say, Medusa? Did you hear that, me?</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> I did hear that, me. I can hardly believe what our foolish sister just said.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> I heard her saying she&#39;s happy to take OUR role as the small, cute goddess for herself!</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> Wha...!? N-no! That wasn&#39;t what I meant!</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> Oh...oh, my. How could you treat your older sisters this way, when all we&#39;ve done was treat you with kindness and compassion...</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> True... But such an idea as this couldn&#39;t be something Medusa concocted alone.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> There must be someone else who should be persecuted as her coconspirator...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Could that be...me...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (Attempt to avert gaze)</p><hr><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> The Master is responsible for their Servants. Isn&#39;t that how it works here?</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> This entire Servant system is wrong to begin with.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> To have goddesses like ourselves manifest in this world only to be used as Servants to fight is just such a horrid idea.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> We aren&#39;t able to fight, and we could starve if we were left alone. We are the eternal girls who cannot live without help from others... That is who we are.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> Oh...perhaps that&#39;s why...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...?</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> Medusa has manifested in this world with our usual cuteness. We manifested here with the power to fight, something that isn&#39;t really innate to us.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> There is a possibility that the three of us took the attractive features away from one another to make it our own.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> ...I see. What a profound statement, me. Then we must confirm your hypothesis!</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> Yes, let&#39;s move to a different location, me.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> ...? Um, big older sister and little older sister...to where?</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> Quiet, you! You don&#39;t get to refuse.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> ...Where are we?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This is Chaldea&#39;s training ground.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> We can go all-out here.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> Yes, just something to punish our younger sister and Master who took something precious away from us and gave us something useless in exchange.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> I&#39;ll warn you that you mustn&#39;t hold back, Medusa. We&#39;re doing this to test out fighting abilities, too.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> B-but...!</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> Now, let&#39;s begin.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> Honestly, playing with our little sister like this is new to us, too!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> I can&#39;t believe! They really hit us!</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> Ah... So, it&#39;s true... No one likes us...</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> To be defeated by the cute, stylish, and maybe overly romantic version of our younger sister...</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> Y-you have it all wrong, big older sister and little older sister! You said I shouldn&#39;t hold back...</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> We were just saying that! Ugh, do we have to spell EVERYTHING out for you!?</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> The younger sister CANNOT be better than her older sisters!</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> Ow...ow...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh...she&#39;s pulling Medusa&#39;s cheek really hard...</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> ...Now that I think about it, using Charm against Medusa was pointless.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> A-actually! It hit me really good! B-because...well...because my older sisters were too cute...it was so intense...</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> Oh? How could you let such lies pass through your lips? How dare you!?</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> Ow...ow...ah...ahh...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh...and now they&#39;re tugging her other cheek...</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> But now we know...our battle skills really are only so-so.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> Yes. It appears violent battles really are Medusa&#39;s only skill.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> ...Of course. If something were to happen, I would step in to solve the problem, and be sure to do so without bothering my older sisters.</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> But I&#39;m sorry... With this small body of mine, I&#39;m not sure how much I can be of help...</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> Oh, my. Did you hear that, me?</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> Medusa just flat-out admitted that she stole the title of cutest goddess from us.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> Oh yes, I heard, me.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> Isn&#39;t that like boasting you got paid, even though you skived off work? I believe that&#39;s quite unfair.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> It may be nice...but let&#39;s put that topic aside. There is just one thing I can&#39;t accept as the older sister.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> I really must say that we simply must do something about you being so small. It&#39;s not right to have you be the same size as us.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Well...isn&#39;t that just something that can&#39;t be changed...?</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> Oh, I know. I vaguely remember being with a super big person recently.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> Our problem is because the three of us are lined up together.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> If there was another person who is even bigger, Medusa&#39;s annoying short stature shouldn&#39;t stand out.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> Good idea. But is there someone who would fit the bill?</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> Leave it to me! We&#39;re at the training ground. If I do this...and press this...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ah...um, Euryale! That button starts up the training program...!</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> I know. I&#39;m just bringing up something big to test our theory. I&#39;m as smart as I am cute... You know, I sometimes scare myself\u266A</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> Size? MAX, of course! Difficulty? I don&#39;t know what that means, but \u201CSuper Difficult Mode\u201D sounds good!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> U-um!</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> That&#39;ll do it. And...start\u266A</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> Me. It&#39;s big, but I think it&#39;s TOO big...</p><p><strong>???:</strong></p><p>...!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I think...maybe...all that button mashing made it go berserk! It&#39;s coming at us without any limiters!</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> ...Older sisters, watch out!</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> Begone...! I won&#39;t let you lay a finger on my sisters!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> ...Whew. I managed to defeat them. How are my older sisters...?</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> Oh...I&#39;m so glad...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Medusa!? Oh no... She&#39;s collapsed from her wounds...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Let&#39;s carry her to the infirmary.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Let&#39;s treat her right away.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But we lack the first aid here...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The best thing to do is to transport her to an appropriate place for treatment, Senpai. Let&#39;s go.</p><hr><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> I can&#39;t believe she went down before us. Look at that face... She looks like she thinks she just did something really great.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> ...I agree. She shouldn&#39;t look so smug.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> U-um, she&#39;s injured, so would you please not pull her cheek right now?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We need to take her to the infirmary. Please, step aside...I&#39;m going to...</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> No need. This is the result of our foolish younger sister&#39;s carelessness. It&#39;s something her family should take care of.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> Indeed. Making her two older sisters go through so much trouble...she really is a dumb, clumsy, and good-for-nothing younger sister.</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> If Mash takes her, she won&#39;t know how much trouble she caused for us when she finally wakes up, now will she?</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> For her to owe us...to remind her that she will always be beneath her older sisters, I will carry her. I don&#39;t want to, but I will.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (Oh...they&#39;ve lined up side-by-side...and the two of them are carrying Medusa on their backs...)</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> Unhhh...older...sisters...</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> ...If there&#39;s a silver lining for Medusa having this form...</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> Yes... If she was a giant, the two of us wouldn&#39;t have been able to carry her like this.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> ...If she was a giant, what would we have done...?</p><p><strong>Euryale:</strong> ...We probably would have rolled her like a barrel.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Senpai. There are times when watching Stheno and Euryale&#39;s banter worries me...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But I feel that a lot of the reason they behave that way is because of the absolute, unwavering confidence in their bonds with each other.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> They&#39;re family.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> They have a bond.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. Even if one of them looks different than before, the fact that they are family will never change.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No matter what, they are a trio of sisters who get along very well!</p>',202),a=[n];function h(g,i){return t(),s("div",null,a)}var u=e(r,[["render",h],["__file","Medusa Lily.html.vue"]]);export{u as default};
