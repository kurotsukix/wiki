Or would you not?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Fight.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> Your bravery always impresses me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Protect.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> Yeah, you always have the right answers.</p><hr><p><strong>Billy:</strong> After you.</p><p><strong>Scoundrel:</strong> You bastard!</p><p><strong>Scoundrel:</strong> Oww...ow! Damn...you...!</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> With a hand that slow, nobody would hire you as a gunman. Well, might as well do some honest work. Who knows, good things might happen!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Look how he moves. I never imagined the human body could move so quickly...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The best quickdraw in the West, a move so great, it&#39;s almost legendary.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I&#39;d like to see that for myself someday.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> Um...Master? Master, do you have a minute?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What&#39;s wrong?</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> I just got some news at a saloon. Seems like this town&#39;s getting targeted.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Sure!</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> Haha, my Master&#39;s sure upbeat!</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> Anyway. I hear that this town&#39;s getting targeted.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Targeted...by whom?</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> Bandits, scoundrels. Like that lot we encountered earlier. Spooked the sheriff and now he&#39;s useless.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> And the townspeople are afraid to go out. I wanna help them. That&#39;s not a bad thing, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I think that&#39;s great.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> Oh, okay! Then let&#39;s do it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Unforgiven!</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> I knew my Master&#39;d be up for anything! I&#39;m really starting to like you!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai, I don&#39;t know if you should have accepted this task so lightly. You should at least have asked how many you&#39;re going up against...</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> Oh, I don&#39;t know either. Hold on. I&#39;ll go ask.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Protecting this town from scoundrels... (Gasp) This is a standard setup for a Western movie!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh my...what a very cowboy-ish setting, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Do you like that sorta thing?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um, well, not exactly... But there were books about it in the library, and I got engrossed in the story...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You seem to know a lot.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, there were Westerns in the library, so I studied them as if they were classic stories.</p><hr><p><strong>Billy:</strong> Hey Master, Master! I asked around to see how many there are.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So how many are there?</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> About a thousand.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> 1,000. I see. It&#39;s a typical Western setting\u2013 Ehhh!? A THOUSAND!?</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> Master, give me your binoculars. Okay, I see them... Hey, isn&#39;t that...!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hmmm. It appears that your opponent has hired a bunch of leftover Celtic soldiers.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Impossible...that army should have disappeared when Queen Medb was defeated!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> They&#39;ve been summoned to this time and place before, and the area is still very unstable in space time.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> With a bit of coincidence and sheer luck, they could very well be summoned again by employing the proper technique.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That said, it would be impossible for an amateur with no knowledge of magecraft to just pull off a freak summoning out of nowhere. Which means...</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> The other side has a mage, too...or someone like that.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Naturally. That&#39;s what worries me.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> One thousand Celtic soldiers...that&#39;s quite the number.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master! Take a look at this!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> This can&#39;t be...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> A Servant signature?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes! It appears that numerous Servants are getting summoned as countermeasures.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I can&#39;t believe that many Heroic Spirits are willing to come. Maybe they&#39;re spoiling for a fight. Or they&#39;re just natural heroes down to their core.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Well, doesn&#39;t matter. We&#39;ll take all the help we can get.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> We&#39;ll operate as if we&#39;re fixing a Singularity, Fujimaru. Explain to the Servants and ask them for help.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> Haha, Master! This is really turning into a Western!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Teamwork!</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> Roger that, Master! All right, let&#39;s do this!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Gunfight at the corral!</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> Haha, okay, Master! You&#39;ll get front row seats to watch how I handle my guns!</p><hr><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> Listen up...that town ahead has tons of people, food, and gold.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> ...Take them all. Loot everything you can find.</p><p><strong>Celtic Soldier:</strong> Yeah!!!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> We are hungry wolves. We are beasts who only know how to fight and eat.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> That&#39;s fine. If we don&#39;t do so, we can&#39;t lay our roots down on this continent.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> Steal the leylines and make this grand continent our own. No gun or sword is a match for you.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> Now, go!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> Use this place as a base so our clan can prosper once again!</p><p><strong>Celtic Soldier:</strong> Reporting! A hundred of our front line soldiers have been annihilated.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> I see that our enemy is quite the adversary.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> What!?</p><p><strong>Celtic Soldier:</strong> Our enemies also have Servants.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> Servants...why you...!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Let&#39;s wind the clock back a bit here.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> And so, in order to protect this town from a thousand Celtic bandits, I need everyone&#39;s help!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong> Hahaha! So it&#39;s Thermopylae once again! That does get me fired up!</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong> I, Leonidas I, shall offer my shield in protection of this town!</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong> Any one Servant is a match for a thousand soldiers, and we have seven. There&#39;s nothing to fear!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong> No wonder Servants who are experts in defense got summoned.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> But do you think this old man will be useful in this modern world?</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> Either way, I got it. Hektor of Troy... I ask that you don&#39;t overwork me.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> Bandits are oppression. That means this town is being oppressed right now!</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> It is my duty to destroy all oppressors!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> Understood, agreed, and ready to succeed! Defense may not be my forte, but leave surprising the enemy and sowing chaos in their ranks to me!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> For I am Mephistopheles! I shall spread the joy of confusion to the enemies!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Ah, despair is so delicious!</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> Assignment accepted. I can see why we were called, as many enemies as there are.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Hmph. As long as you have Hassan of the Hundred Personas, I shall fill out our numbers to match theirs!</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Admittedly, protecting a town is not the typical duty of an assassin, but it&#39;s not as if I have no experience in doing such a thing.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A???:</strong> Well, summoning me makes sense, at least.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> I, Diarmuid Ua Duibhne, have apparently run amok in this land before.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> But that was as an enemy. I would like to wield my dual lances as an ally this time.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> ...Amazing. A handful of heroes facing off against a horde or enemies... This is what I&#39;ve waited for!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> Master! What is your command!? I shall paint this entire battlefield red with blood!</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> Wow, I didn&#39;t think everyone would agree to join!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s good.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> They may say otherwise, but they&#39;re all softies at heart. After all, there&#39;s nothing to gain from this.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It&#39;s all thanks to Billy running around.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> You think so? Heh. That&#39;s flattering if it&#39;s true.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Mash Kyrielight shall help you all by navigating for you!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I will immediately inform you all if there are any changes in the town.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> All right. Let&#39;s start by evacuating everyone in the town.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> We&#39;re going to take them to the cave inside a forest nearby. I&#39;ve already spoken to the sheriff.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Then we shall be in charge of leading the way. We do have a Hassan persona who is good at organizing lines.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> ...It&#39;s true. Fighting on the front line is not the only way to do it. Miss Hassan has the role of establishing communication with everyone.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> It&#39;s not as exciting or glorious, but I will also accompany Miss Hassan. We need to avoid getting attacked from both sides.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Thanks, you two!</p><hr><p><strong>Both:</strong> Roger that!</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> Think about it, Master. We now have seven reliable Servants.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> Let&#39;s start with the enemy&#39;s front line!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong> The enemies were spineless! How careless of them to put such weaklings on the front lines!</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong> However, there are still more. We should rest up while we have the chance.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> Hey, good work.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> This is probably going to be a drawn-out battle, so Master, you should rest a bit.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> Those are proper Celtic soldiers out there. They&#39;re quite the adversary considering how many there are.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Master, I have my report for you: evacuation of the townspeople is not yet complete.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> We&#39;ve gotten about forty percent out. I&#39;m impressed with how well Diarmuid has handled the women...</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> But there are still children and the elderly. It won&#39;t be easy evacuating them all.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> Master! They&#39;re here! More incoming!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> The two of us will put the evacuations on hold for now and join you in battle.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Thanks, Diarmuid!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> Leave it to me!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Billy, are you ready!?</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> Of course! I&#39;m done reloading my gun. Now, come at us, invaders!</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> This&#39;ll be like a shooting gallery!</p><hr><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Next report. Good news: half of the town&#39;s population has been evacuated. However...</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> We have eagle-eyed enemies. Some of the Celts are trying to sneak ahead and ambush them.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Spartacus is intercepting their attacks and Mephistopheles is confusing the enemy to hold them back.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Still, it looks like the evacuees in the rear will come under attack.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong> Master. Leave this area to us! Please prioritize the evacuees!</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> Get going, Master and Billy! This is the path that you two have chosen to take!</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> ...Okay! Master! Mount your horse! We&#39;re going together!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Got it!</p><hr><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> There&#39;s still so many townspeople left...!</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> OPPRESSOOOOOOOOORRRRRRSSS!!!</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> Crap, Spartacus is getting pinned down!</p><p><strong>Celtic Soldier:</strong> Huh?</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock. Ahhh, watching an explosion is always so exciting!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The townspeople are spooked by Mephistopheles, and they&#39;ve slowed down even more...</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> Okay. Master, what should we do!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Rescue Spartacus!</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> Okay, Master. BANG! BANG! BANG!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Fight alongside Mephistopheles!</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> Okay, Master. BANG! BANG! BANG!</p><hr><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> Master, give me the bandolier I handed you earlier!</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> Thanks! Okay! Let&#39;s keep going!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> !</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> There are some Celtic soldiers trying to attack the evacuees! Please do something!</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> Why you...!</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> Crap...I misfired...!</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> Hahahaha! I shall be the anvil against which our oppressors are crushed!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Spartacus!</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> My love...is going to explode!</p><p><strong>Celtic Soldier:</strong> Wha...!?</p><p><strong>Spartacus:</strong> Oppression will not be suffered to continue... Now die...knowing that truth...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Spartacus has disappeared while taking in the Celtic Soldiers around him...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Damn...</p><hr><p><strong>Billy:</strong> I&#39;m sorry. It was my mistake.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> No. We were just unlucky. And you know, if you think that was as bad as things get...</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> ...then there&#39;s nowhere to go from here but up! Okay, here&#39;s another bomb!</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> We have about eighty percent of the civilians evacuated. Just a little bit more.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> Ungh...these are...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Detecting two giant enemies right next to Diarmuid. A chimera and a Spriggan!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I didn&#39;t think those were still around...!</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> It just means that the Incineration of Humanity left that much of a mark here! Let&#39;s rescue everyone!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> You saved us, my lord...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Don&#39;t worry about it!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master! I&#39;m still picking up the chimera!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> Please stand back!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> Ungh...nnnnnggggh!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> Twin spears!</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> Diarmuid!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> ...It seems this is the end for me. I leave the rest to you...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Okay.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> I have regrets...but...this isn&#39;t...that bad...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...Good work.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> Hahahaha, I only did what is expected of a Servant. Thank you, Master.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> Though it was brief, I&#39;m glad to have fought alongside you...</p><hr><p><strong>Billy:</strong> ...Let&#39;s go, Master!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> There are no more giant enemy responses. Let&#39;s move forward!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Mash, how are Hektor and the others doing!?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The Celts have broken through the barricade!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Leonidas is still holding them off, but he won&#39;t last much longer...!</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong> All right! It seems this is the end for me!</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong> Sir Hektor, this will be my final effort, so let us activate our Noble Phantasms together!</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> Tch. I got the short end of the stick here. I&#39;d rather trade places with you, Leonidas.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong> Hahahaha. Unfortunately, the rear guard in battle is what truly makes a fight shine. I cannot trade places with you now!</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> ...It was an honor to have fought alongside you, Guardian of the Hot Gate.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong> And you, Sir Hektor of the Shining Helmet. It was a great honor...!</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> Let&#39;s go...Durindana! Blow &#39;em away!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;ve...lost Leonidas&#39;s signal... Hektor is still okay.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Everyone has been evacuated! We&#39;ll hold the enemy back so they don&#39;t chase after the civilians!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> I shall string them along and toy with them! Ahhh, blowing them up will give me such a thrill!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...I&#39;m counting on you, Hassan.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Why the sudden formality? It was always going to go like this. I was ready for this.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Now, there are only ten of us. Just don&#39;t make this a losing battle for us, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Thank you, Mephisto.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> What are you talking about, my little Rabbit!? I simply wanted to explode my bombs. And you simply wanted to protect the town.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Isn&#39;t this a win-win situation?</p><hr><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Don&#39;t just stand there, Mephistopheles! To battle!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Okay! It&#39;s time for our final stand! Take care, you guys!</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> Okay, Master! Let&#39;s go. Let&#39;s leave this place to them!</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> So?</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Oh? Whatever do you mean by \u201Cso\u201D?</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> How many bombs do you have left? Aren&#39;t you running low?</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Ah. Well, this may be a surprise, but I have a great many hidden pockets!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> One...two...three... I have a total of five more.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> And when you run out of those, our only option will be a suicide attack. An Assassin relying on a suicide attack... Ugh, how mortifying.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> If this reached the ears of the First One, I&#39;m sure to get a lecture more terrifying than death itself!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Ah, but our destiny is to gloriously bloom and scatter like flower petals. And that means we just need to go out with a BANG!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Let&#39;s go out in the flashiest way.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Unbelievable. I envy the jester his carelessness. Well, I suppose neither of us ever look back!</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> Hektor!</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> Hey, Billy. I just set off the final trap.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> It&#39;s a simple oil barrel, but I bought enough time to chat. Are all the civilians evacuated?</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> A chase is inevitable, but don&#39;t worry about that for now.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> All right... This town is isolated and it stretches narrowly from north to south. Setting up a front line here to defend it wasn&#39;t an option.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> But now that the townspeople are gone, it&#39;s a different story. This old man is ready to go wild.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> You just need to hurry over and deal with the enemy&#39;s boss with Master.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> Whoa, that&#39;s a big responsibility.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> No role is insignificant in this situation. So which is it? Are you going to do it, or not?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Let&#39;s do it.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> Excellent, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What do you think, Billy?</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> Of course we&#39;ll do it! And Master seems to be on the same page!</p><hr><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> Yeah. That&#39;s the spirit.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> Got it. Now, go! I&#39;ll cover you!</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> Master, sit behind me! We&#39;re going to break through the enemy line!</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> Now then...I don&#39;t have enough magical energy to shoot off Durindana...</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> But as luck would have it, I&#39;m skilled at throwing things! As long as I have a rock or two, you lot aren&#39;t long for this world!</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> Hang in there, Silver!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Silver?</p><hr><p><strong>Billy:</strong> My horse&#39;s name! We&#39;re going to intercept the enemy here!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> Okay, we&#39;ve broken through the enemy line completely! Run! Run!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m detecting enemies up ahead! Looks like they have a huge amount of magical energy, so please be careful!</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> I know! I feel it stinging! It feels like Pat Garrett&#39;s bloodlust!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Can a human possibly exude so much bloodlust!?</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> They can. Especially during the pioneering days!</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> ...Now tell us. Who the heck are you?</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> Ehh, doesn&#39;t really matter.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Why you...stupid Servants! I can&#39;t believe my ambitions have been halted by mere familiars...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> My golden opportunity lay right after humanity was restored. I took over this land&#39;s leyline...and I will take my revenge against the Mage&#39;s Association...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Based on what he&#39;s saying, I assume he&#39;s a mage who was expelled from the Mage&#39;s Association for political reasons.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong> With this vast land and the leyline spread throughout it...my clan will return to its former glory.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong> The United States just needs to disappear from the face of history. An insignificant mote of dust that knows nothing of magecraft.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> America, huh? Well, I guess I call it my homeland.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> But if you say it&#39;s not, I can&#39;t really argue that either.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> This is not my land, and it&#39;s not yours either.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> We&#39;re just transient caretakers of the land. Now, draw, mage!</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> Let&#39;s see who&#39;s faster.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong> Kill... I&#39;ll kill you! I will not let you get in the way of my golden revenge!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mage:</strong> Ungh!</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> This is the final shot, mage. I only have one bullet left.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> And I take it that you only have one more magecraft use left before you need to rest up.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> It&#39;ll be a duel. Ready?</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong> ...Fine.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> There&#39;ll be no signal. As soon as both of us are ready, we go.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong> Okay. Fine.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong> (Stupid.)</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong> (I&#39;ve already set up protective spells... That guy&#39;s bullets are low in Divinity. There&#39;s no chance they will\u2013)</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong> Eh?</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> Okay. I win.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong> Eh...wait...I haven&#39;t... No...what...I...wait...wait...wait...!</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong> What? I&#39;m...dead!? He penetrated my defense. How?</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong> How? How? How?</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> Sorry &#39;bout that. I&#39;m an outlaw. I&#39;m a villainous kid who plays dirty and always has a trick up his sleeve.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> Yep, yeah...</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> Well, I fired three shots almost simultaneously at the same target, so we can call that a single shot, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You had me worried!</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> Oh, I didn&#39;t intend to scare you. Sorry &#39;bout that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I believed in you.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> Uh...um...</p><hr><p><strong>Billy:</strong> Thanks, Master. What? Don&#39;t look over here.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> I said don&#39;t look at me!</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> Hey, is it over?</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> Thanks, Hektor.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> Don&#39;t sweat it. I was able to protect you this time. I&#39;ll always accept a role like this.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> ...Uh, well I take that back. Next time, summon me for easier battles.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Hmph. I never expected I would give an after-action report, even if I&#39;m the only one left.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> But it was a great contract, Master. You were true to your word, and it didn&#39;t end up being a losing battle.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> Ah, and I have this: a parting gift from Mephistopheles.</p><p><strong>Hundred Personas:</strong> That laughing man seemed to enjoy it till the very end.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> A gift from Mephistopheles? Is that...</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> A bomb!?</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> Hyaaah!</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> ...Hm?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It says \u201Ccongratulations.\u201D</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It looks like they&#39;re just noisemakers.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> That guy messed around until the very end. Man...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But if it wasn&#39;t for Mephistopheles, matters would have been much worse.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> Right. He&#39;s definitely better to have as an ally than enemy.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> Now then. Even after the heroes return, we have so much to do.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong> We need to bring all the civilians back, and I need to collect my reward from the sheriff.
