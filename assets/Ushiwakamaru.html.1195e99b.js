Good morning Master! What&#39;s wrong?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Where are we?</p><hr><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> Now that you mention it... That is strange. Did the Rayshift fail?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> Where are Mash and Fou?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Over here.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> Mash, Fou! I&#39;m glad you&#39;re safe!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> Are you hurt? If something happened to you, Master would be sad.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Nnn, kyu.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m fine.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...It seems there was an accident during Rayshift. Please wait while I ask the Doctor to bring us back.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Sorry everybody. I don&#39;t know what happened, but I have your signals here.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> There&#39;s no data on where you jumped, but it&#39;s spatially stable.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Give me a minute. Once the repairs are done, I&#39;ll bring you back.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> Understood! Master, I&#39;ll go look and make sure there&#39;s no danger!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Actually, we should stick together. Is that all right with you, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> No problem.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Let&#39;s do that.</p><hr><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> Okay!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master, Ushiwakamaru, watch yourselves.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> I-I&#39;m fine... Hyaaah!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> I-I&#39;m sorry. Thank you! I was raised by the Kurama Tengu and I still slipped...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> Still, this forest\u2013 It seems different than the one in my country.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s right. From the look of that coast... Are we on a deserted island?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> You&#39;re probably right, Mash. There&#39;s likely no land bridge.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> If we&#39;re trapped here, should we chop some wood and make a raft?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> If we can Rayshift back, we probably won&#39;t need a raft.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> Too bad. I&#39;m quite good at chopping wood\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What&#39;s wrong?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> \u2013Be quiet. I sense an evil presence.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Me too. Fou, be quiet.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Kyu.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> ... S-Sorry.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> Fou&#39;s so cute, I feel like my heart skipped a beat.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> The presence\u2013is starting to approach. Master, shall we launch a surprise attack?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Let&#39;s do that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Got it.</p><hr><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> Right, I&#39;ll go around the side. Mash, you intercept them.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Wow... Her &quot;Presence Concealment&quot; is Assassin level. Let&#39;s do this, Master stand back.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Here they come!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> I trapped them! Let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> Whew! That was good exercise! By the way, can we eat them?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Probably not a good idea to eat the Lamia...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> A shame. If you carefully drain them of blood, snakes can be quite delicious.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> I used to eat them all the time during war.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I-I see...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> This island is pretty small, huh? Doesn&#39;t look like there&#39;s much to see.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> ...A bit of a shame, really.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Oh, hello? It&#39;s the Doctor. It&#39;s going to take me a little longer to adjust the Rayshift.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It&#39;s just refusing to stabilize...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Understood. ...I&#39;m sorry. Looks like it will take a bit more time.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> Anyway Master, I want to hear a story about you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> About me?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Why?</p><hr><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> Is it strange to want to know about one&#39;s Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m boring.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;m not interesting...</p><hr><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> No, I want to learn about you, Master.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> I might not be the best listener, but I&#39;ll try my hardest. So please, go ahead!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> ...I see, I see. Thank you, Master!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> ...Looks like the Rayshift&#39;s not ready yet. It&#39;s so quiet.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> Master, um... I have a question\u2013</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> Am I useful to you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Of course.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Obviously.</p><hr><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> I see. Glad to hear it. I...I&#39;m used to people telling me they don&#39;t understand me.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> When I tell them I want to fight for someone else&#39;s sake, they all seem confused.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> Is my reason that strange?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> I fought for my brother&#39;s sake, but he never believed me, even until the end.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> It&#39;s true that there were misunderstandings, but I never thought of hurting him even once\u2013</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> I&#39;m not angry. It&#39;s just strange to me. Why can&#39;t people understand how I feel?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> I&#39;m sorry. This isn&#39;t something I should be talking about with you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Don&#39;t worry about it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I want to hear more.</p><hr><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> ...You&#39;re a lot like Ise Yoshimori, you know?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> Oh, I don&#39;t mean that you look like him. He had a face like a wicked fox.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> But he was easy to talk to. About serious things, or just joking around.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> You have many Servants. But you take time to talk to them one-on-one\u2013</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> It&#39;s a little embarrassing, but I&#39;m very grateful.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Is it ready? Doctor? I think it&#39;s time for us to go back\u2013</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Oh, sorry. I have bad news.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Go ahead with the bad news, Dr. Roman.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Just so we&#39;re clear, this isn&#39;t my fault, okay?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Until you can stabilize that area, even if you try to return, you&#39;ll just end up somewhere else.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The cause of the instability circles around the island. Any ideas?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Around the island? Could it be\u2013that ship?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I thought it might be a ship... Yeah. I&#39;m picking up magical energy coming from it.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Can you go there and remove the source of the instability?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> I think so. Let&#39;s jump aboard when it gets close.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A-At this distance?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> Mash, I once jumped across eight ships. This is nothing.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> ...I think it&#39;s about time. Mash, once I&#39;m aboard I&#39;ll bring the ship close.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Understood.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> Just watch me. Master, take this\u2013 &quot;Dan-No-Ura Eight-Boat Leap!&quot;\u2013Here I go!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> S-She jumped! She jumped over eight boats in length!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> I did it! Okay guys, sorry! But I&#39;m taking this boat to shore!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> I promise I won&#39;t kill you\u2013</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> I won&#39;t kill you\u2013 Oh, no! They&#39;re already dead!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> U-Um, Ushiwakamaru seems to be having a hard time!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Let&#39;s wait and believe.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> She&#39;ll be fine.</p><hr><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> I&#39;m getting this boat to shore\u2013 Tch, get out of my way!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> Okay, got it! Mash! I&#39;m turning the boat around!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s getting closer. At this range I can do it too\u2013!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ushiwakamaru!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> Oh, Mash! Sorry, it took me a while!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I see. It was a ghost ship!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> U-Um, Mash?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> Was Master disappointed? It did take me a while...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Don&#39;t worry. Master believed in you.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> I see! Okay, then nothing can stop me!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> Come, you ghastly creatures! My name is Minamoto\u2013No, Ushiwakamaru!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> As a Servant of Fujimaru, I shall defeat you!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> Yup, that&#39;s most of them. Master! Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (Wave to her.)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Good job!</p><hr><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> Mash! Master praised me!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m so happy for you, Ushiwakamaru!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> Right!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Hey guys, the readings from that ghost ship isn&#39;t totally gone.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> If you don&#39;t hurry up, you won&#39;t be able to come home.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> Huh? Really? But\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I don&#39;t see anything else...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> A mist? Rising from the bodies?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I see, the vengeful spirit driving the ship was the source of the instability!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> \u2013Okay Mash, this time let&#39;s finish it.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> Evil is destined to fall. Especially, wicked demons...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> Your grudge shall be slain by me \u2013Ushiwakamaru!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> I defeated them!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Okay, you all can come home now. Let me know when you&#39;re ready.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Understood. Let&#39;s meet with Master first.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> Master, I have slain the vengeful spirits!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> It&#39;s a shame you couldn&#39;t see me since we were fighting on the decks...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> But next time, I promise to fight somewhere you can see!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> And um...well. If you wouldn&#39;t mind...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> Oh, no... Never mind, I guess...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What is it?</p><hr><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> D-Do you think you could maybe pat me on the head? I&#39;d really like that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Sure.</p><hr><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> Thank you!</p>',177),n=[e];function h(g,i){return s(),r("div",null,n)}var u=t(o,[["render",h],["__file","Ushiwakamaru.html.vue"]]);export{u as default};
