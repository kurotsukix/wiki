This is about 10% of its original power.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> T-Ten percent?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> I accept you as my Master, Fujimaru. But that doesn&#39;t mean I pledge my loyalty to you.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> The most important thing in this world is trust. By fighting together, I was able to know you better.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> But, that is not enough. Therefore, I would like to test you, Master.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> It&#39;s simple. Just join me for three fights. During those fights, I will obey your every order.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> On the other hand, I won&#39;t do anything aside from obeying your orders. How well you utilize me as a weapon...</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> That&#39;s what I want to see. Is that all right?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> ...Oh, there&#39;s no problem if you want the other Servants to help as well.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> I&#39;m looking forward to it.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> I know this is sudden, but enemies are approaching. As always, enemies this level are easy prey for us.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> I seek a graceful, quick delivery of instructions from you, Master. That is all.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> Hmm, well done. Cutting off all thought and letting myself be controlled is not a bad feeling.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> However, don&#39;t get overconfident about beating those weaklings. The next enemies will be somewhat formidable.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> You must be able to defeat formidable opponents with ease. Otherwise, you&#39;re unfit to be a commander.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> ...Don&#39;t worry. At least there&#39;s no fear of getting killed.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> I, Arjuna, guarantee it. Well, let the fight begin.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Whew...</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> Splendid! I acknowledge that there is no problem with Master&#39;s ability to command.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> Now, this is the last test. Considering the type of enemies we may face in the future...</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> I had a Servant prepared for this. No longer will you be fighting a mindless beast, but rather a true Hero recognized by the World itself.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> We must win. No matter how strong the enemy is, I must obtain a glorious victory.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> ...No, I guess WE must obtain a glorious victory. Come, let&#39;s fight.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> I shall be a silent arrow! You just need to fire me toward the ones you recognize as your enemy.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> That&#39;s the ideal relationship of a Servant and a Master. Now, let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> \u2013Good. As expected, your talents as a Master are genuine. I trust you fully, and therefore pledge my allegiance to you.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> The name of my bow is Agni Gandiva. This divine bow granted by the God of Flame can shoot down anything.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> I will show you its true strength in our upcoming battles.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> ...Oh?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> \u2013Heh heh, this bow is ideal for you. Why don&#39;t I show you the true brilliance of its flame now!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> By the hellfire of Agni, God of Flame, be incinerated to ashes! ...No, this is not enough.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> O Shiva, God of Destruction... Rain down divine punishment upon my foes!</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> ...How was that, Master? No, you don&#39;t have to say anything.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> With this, my power has been proven. My weapon and Noble Phantasm are the most powerful of their kind.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> You can proudly declare that I&#39;m the best Servant.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> U-Um...</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> Yes?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The forest has been leveled.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> ...Uh...uh...</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> I think I was a little too enthusiastic... I am sorry.</p><h2 id="by-continuing-to-question" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#by-continuing-to-question" aria-hidden="true">#</a> By Continuing to Question</h2><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> ...There you are, Karna.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong> Arjuna.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> No obstacles remain for me. Even if they did, I would destroy them all.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> This will be the end. I may be called a coward, but I will kill you.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> I need to kill you! You know me, after all!</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong> ...So this is karma. There is not room enough in the world for two supreme marksmen.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong> My lance should be alone in its ability to scorch the land.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong> There&#39;s no question of who dies here. The loser will become unnecessary.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong> Come at me, Arjuna. Lay it all on the line. Give it everything you have!</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> Don&#39;t speak down to me! You asked for it!</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong> ...Brilliant.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> Haha...hahahaha! Hahahahaha! I win! My...my...my...!</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Is this truly victory? Or is this actually defeat?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I have no sense of satisfaction, no joy from this victory...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I don&#39;t even feel a sense of relief that the battle is over. The only thing that I have is this ceaseless feeling of emptiness.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I just killed the man who knew me best.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I have no regrets. My original sworn enemy...my oldest enemy. We were destined to fight each other. And yet...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> That man, who waded through battle after battle in blinding, golden armor...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...was the one and only hero who knew the ugly side of me.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> ...Why, Karna?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> Why...why did you smile?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> And then my life came to an end while I yet pondered that mystery.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> As Arjuna, the Hero of the Endowed...I existed to protect the future.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> And then I was summoned as a Servant, and participated in many battles. I trust Master wholeheartedly.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> [\u2642 He /\u2640\uFE0F She} may be ordinary, and there are times when [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she} is too optimistic...yet still, [\u2642 he&#39;s /\u2640\uFE0F she&#39;s} a good Master.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> Faithful. Accurate decision-making skills. And [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she} does not treat us Servants as mere familiars. [\u2642 He /\u2640\uFE0F She} treats us with respect, but is not distant.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> Many Servants would consider [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her} the ideal Master. I number myself among them.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> That is why I unleashed the absolute limit of my Noble Phantasm&#39;s power. And yet...</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> I have yet to show my true face to Master. No, I mustn&#39;t show it...</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> My blunt ugliness out in the open...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master. I have detected numerous enemies. It seems like a surprise attack.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> Comfortable battles. A sense of fulfillment I feel knowing that I am fighting in the cause of absolute justice.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> The most wonderful cause of saving the world. Ah...I cannot stop laughing.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What&#39;s wrong?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Arjuna?</p><hr><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> ...No, it&#39;s nothing. Now, let&#39;s go annihilate the enemy.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Enemy response, zero. No problems on our end. I recommend returning.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Good work!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, Master. Good work to you as well. I will have sesame buns ready for you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Let&#39;s get back, Arjuna.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> Yes, understood.</p><hr><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> By the way, Master, was there something on my face a few minutes ago?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> Nothing? I didn&#39;t look myself?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> At least on my end, I did not see any fluctuations in his Spirit Origin value. Perhaps it&#39;s fatigue?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Arjuna, you&#39;ve been volunteering for battle rather frequently recently.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> And the other Servants, especially the battle-hungry ones, have been complaining that it&#39;s not fair.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> ...I may have overexerted myself.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> Understood. I will be sure to leave the battles to the other Servants for a while.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Okay. Good work again!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ah-ha, Senpai. I win in this round of cards. I will be taking this sesame bun as my prize.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> But if you eat right before bed...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...S-Servants don&#39;t gain weight. That applies to Demi-Servants, too!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Probably.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It&#39;s all yours.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Hehe. Don&#39;t sulk, Senpai. I have one for you, too.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Sweet dreams, Senpai...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Night!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, good night.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Good night to you too, Fou.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...?</p><hr><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> ...I defeated him. He&#39;s defeated.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> Haha...hahahaha! Hahahahaha! I win! My...my...my...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Arjuna...?</p><hr><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> Master!? You...</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> ...saw my face, didn&#39;t you.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> You&#39;re finally awake, Master.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> ...I am surprised.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> You do not seem at all bewildered by the unexpected scene you just witnessed.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> It seems that we have fallen into a Servant&#39;s dream. It&#39;s likely that it&#39;s my dream, or that of someone who has some connection with me.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> If it&#39;s mine...then I apologize in advance.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m used to it. This happens a lot.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> Spoken like a true Master. But getting too used to this is hardly a good thing.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> You may one day be a prisoner of a different type of nightmare... Should you die inside a dream, your spirit will perish.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;m in a dream again, aren&#39;t I?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> When you say \u201Cagain,\u201D do you mean you fall into the dreams of others often?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> This is neither a Rayshift nor a case of teleportation.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> It&#39;s truly a curious phenomenon... But this is a first for me.</p><hr><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> Anyway, we can do little if we remain in this darkness. We must analyze our surroundings.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> Master, do not move. If we lose sight of each other, it will be difficult for us to find one another again.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> ...It&#39;s subtle, but I sense a breeze. Let&#39;s head in that direction.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> This place is like a labyrinth...and it&#39;s quite elaborate.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> Not only that... No...one moment.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> This is not right. I do not understand.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What&#39;s wrong?</p><hr><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> My only sense of this is, I admit, intuitive, but this labyrinth does not lead any higher than we are now.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> The only path leads lower...to the bottom.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So there&#39;s no exit?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Seems about right for a dungeon in a nightmare...</p><hr><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> Yes, exactly. It&#39;s nonsensically structured, as only dreams can be.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> Honestly. My apologies. This is most likely my own nightmare.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> Were this your nightmare, it wouldn&#39;t have been as malicious as it is now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> My nightmare... Eli&#39;s last supper. With live music.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> Is this Eli the mixed dragon Servant? Hahaha. A concert festival certainly sounds interesting.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> Eh? A nightmare? Isn&#39;t it just music? What? I don&#39;t get the underlying issue?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> My nightmare would be Nightingale disinfecting me.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> That...is terrifying.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> My own mother, perhaps reflective of the times, spoiled me. Yet I still feel maternal love from Nightingale&#39;s fierceness.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> Either way, isn&#39;t it nice to know the Servant is genuinely concerned for you?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> A dream where she chases after you with a tank of disinfectant on her back? ...I see, that IS a nightmare...</p><hr><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> Anyway, let&#39;s begin our descent. I have a feeling that that is our best option.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> It is annoying, though, to have so many creatures scuttling about... No, it shouldn&#39;t be an issue.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> We should have no trouble breaking through. Now then, let us cut them down.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Enemy response, zero. No problems on our end. I recommend returning.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Good work!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, Master. Good work to you as well.

No, it shouldn&#39;t be an issue.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> We should have no trouble breaking through. Now then, let us cut them down.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> This is my answer: I am a Kshatriya, but I am a Servant\u2013a familiar\u2013at the same time.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> I have a warrior&#39;s pride. I fulfill my duties as a familiar.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> I can be both. I will not forsake my pride as a warrior, even as I swear my loyalty as a familiar.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong> So you understand the theory. A sensible answer, as I would expect from the great Arjuna.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong> But your response is acceptable only because this is a peaceful moment. I wonder whether you can give the same answer in a time of crisis.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> ...Are you mocking me?</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong> Move on to your next trial, hero. Your destined enemy awaits!</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> ...I know. There&#39;s only one warrior in this world who radiates such fighting spirit.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong> You&#39;ve come, Arjuna.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> Karna... Why are you here!? You shouldn&#39;t be in a place like this!</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong> My presence here suggests that you believe otherwise.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong> An enemy who puts a question to Arjuna... That is my role here.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong> I ask of you, my sworn enemy: Who are you?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Krishna:</strong> Ungh! Not yet! Give me your hand, Arjuna!</p><p><strong>Krishna:</strong> We must stand up together to fight against evil!</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> ...No. That&#39;s wrong. You&#39;re wrong, Krishna.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> I know it&#39;s wrong.</p><p><strong>Krishna:</strong> Wh-what?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> I&#39;ve been thinking about this the whole time. It&#39;s because of you that I was able to fire that arrow.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> I blamed all my cowardice, everything I did that was unbecoming of a true warrior...on you.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> ...At that time, I just wanted relief. I thought the battle with Karna was going to last forever.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> The person I had been was being swallowed, and I despaired, knowing I was moving away from the path of a warrior.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> But I must accept it. No matter how much I wish to resist, the one who fired that arrow was...</p><p><strong>Krishna:</strong> Don&#39;t say it, Arjuna! If you say it, you will be cursed for thousands of years!</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong> You must say it, Arjuna.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong> There is no correct answer. The only thing you can do is hold on to your conviction until the very end.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong> There will be times when you will feel lost. That is why we must walk the path with Master.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong> A Servant needs to live their second life carrying their doubts with them.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong> After all, you have never before reached this place where you now stand, not even in life.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> ...I was the one who fired the arrow.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> I held that arrow, I fit the arrow to the bow, and let it loose. It was me, Arjuna.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> I&#39;m sorry.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> Krishna. At that decisive moment, you were not on the chariot with me.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong> That&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong> Krishna was fighting elsewhere. But after he learned of how much humiliation you suffered, he kept quiet.</p><p><strong>Krishna:</strong> ...You are going to be admitting your own evil. Whether you be alive, dead, or even a Heroic Spirit, you cannot ever take that back.</p><p><strong>Krishna:</strong> You will bear this regret for eternity.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> That may be true. But I have decided I will no longer fear regret.</p><p><strong>Krishna:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Krishna:</strong> I see...Then I shall hold on to that regret of yours.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> Krishna?</p><p><strong>Krishna:</strong> Maybe...just maybe...my existence is the leak in the dam.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> I don&#39;t understand what you&#39;re getting at.</p><p><strong>Krishna:</strong> Nothing. I&#39;m just talking to myself. Don&#39;t worry about it. It&#39;s time to wake up, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Krishna:</strong> It&#39;s unlikely I will make another appearance anytime soon. You should forget about this whole dream.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong> I will not be appearing here again. Farewell Arjuna. Farewell Master.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> I will fade away too.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> But I must apologize, Master. The numerous times you were put in danger...all of it was because of me.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> It is probably because the bond between you and I has grown stronger.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> The deeper the bond I form with someone, the more fearful I become of them learning of the existence of my Krishna.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> That&#39;s why I called you to my dream, and tried to kill you.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> I&#39;m such a fool... A vile, detestable betrayer. I would not protest should I be put to death.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> ...Master. Now you know all of who...of what I am.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> And yet, you still embrace my everything...my light, my darkness, and my evil.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> I see... Then I will never again fear that smile of yours, nor this darkness. Never again...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> This...isn&#39;t a dream, is it?</p><hr><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> You have awoken, Master. I thank you for showing me such a wonderful dream.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> And I would also like to apologize for putting your life in danger.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> But I am in something of a bind. The crime that I committed should cost me my life, but if I do offer up my life, I would not be able to fight for you anymore.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> Whatever should I do?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Morning, Arjuna.</p><hr><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> ...Good morning.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> I will waver no more. I will dedicate all that I have to serving you.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> But now that I think about it...</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> I felt like I was on a long, long journey... Yet it seemed a short thing at the same time.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> There is nothing absolute in this world. Various substances prowl, wander, and are transient.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> Emotions are no exception. Even love can one day change to hate and sadness.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> Or the opposite might happen.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> But there is just one thing that I can say with confidence.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong> ...I feel fortunate to have met you.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I am an Archer. My True Name is Arjuna. I am a Kshatriya warrior and a Servant...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I lend my strength to a Master in order to win back the future. I am just an average Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I am a descendant of a god, but not a god myself. I may have incredible power that ordinary humans lack, but I am still human.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I simply fight. I fight for my Master. My reason for fighting is my belief in my Master.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> That is all I require to see myself as a hero. For that purpose, I can embrace the darkness within me and not be abashed by it.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I am an Archer. I am Arjuna.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I am Fujimaru&#39;s Servant.</p>',356),a=[s];function i(g,h){return n(),r("div",null,a)}var u=t(e,[["render",i],["__file","Arjuna.html.vue"]]);export{u as default};
