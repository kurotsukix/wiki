What&#39;s wrong with people these days...?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ...Hey, can you grab those for me?</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Absolutely not. (Toss)</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Thanks! Man, these sticky note things are great.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> ...Hey. What was that person&#39;s name again?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Huh? How the hell should I know? I&#39;m the Queen Witch, remember?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Maybe Hermaphroditus? Oh, I bet it&#39;s Clytemnestra.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> That&#39;s it. I could not remember for the life of me. ...Mm.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> What is this stuff?</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Apple chips. They are quite good. If you eat two at once, it changes the flavor.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Oh please, don&#39;t be ridiculous. There&#39;s no way that could... (Munch)</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Whoa... You&#39;re right. (Munch, munch)</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Here Mash, you&#39;ve gotta try these. You get a whole different flavor if you eat two at a time!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> O-okay, thank you. I&#39;d be glad to try some.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (Munch, crunch...)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (...I know I have no real basis for thinking this, but...)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (...is this what most teenage girls do when they spend time together?)</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> ...You there, witch. What spell tome are you reading?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> It&#39;s Queen Witch.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> What a garish cover. The cover&#39;s array of pink fluorescent hearts makes my eyes water.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> And why is it so thick? Is it meant to be used as a bludgeon?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Remember that weird field trip we went on the other day? I just happened to find this when we stopped by that convenience store. Hehehe!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Check out all the bonus stuff they give you with it!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Matching aprons, adorable oven mitts, and a selfie stick with Cupid wings!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> And...ooh, I&#39;m sensing a lot of magical energy from this special marriage registration in the back!</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> I see. Good for you. Enjoy your reading, then.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> ...Circe! Get up already!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh... Hello, Nitocris. Thank you for helping Senpai out.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> Of course. Though I must say, I didn&#39;t expect to come back to such a sad state of affairs.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> How can you still call yourself a teacher, wallowing about like a pig?</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> It&#39;s deplorable... All the other witches from the great Age of Gods would be ashamed of you!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Ugh, lay offa me! What are you, my mother?</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> O-of course not. M-more of a conscientious younger sister.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> At any rate, I know Medea already talked to you about this too...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> ...but make sure you fill out the Caster bulletin and put it back where it belongs like we asked you to!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Yeah, yeah, I got it already.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> Hmph...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Who&#39;s turning into a pig now?</p><hr><p><strong>Circe:</strong></p><p>Aah! (Frenzied cleaning)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, hello, Senpai. We were just changing shifts. You have a break now too, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You okay, Circe?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> H-hey there, Piglet! I&#39;m doing better than okay! What a coincidence, running into you here!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> If you&#39;re tired, I&#39;ve got some kykeon all ready to go for an afternoon snack!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> I&#39;ve also got a remedy that&#39;ll double your fatigue now but make it all go away like magic in a few days if you like.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> When are you going to figure out that administering it in small doses only ends up increasing your target&#39;s poison resistance?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Everything okay, Circe?</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> I believe she is panicking about being compared to all the new Greek additions that have shown up as of late.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Please do not be too harsh with her.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Stop that! Don&#39;t you look away like that just &#39;cause you&#39;re feeling awkward, Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> H-here, Senpai, why don&#39;t you have a seat? I&#39;ll go make some tea.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Thanks, Mash.</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What&#39;re you watching there, Atalante?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I couldn&#39;t help but notice you&#39;ve been watching it very intently.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I also noticed you tearing up at times, so I wasn&#39;t sure what to say...</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> O-oh... This?</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> This is an old video I found in Chaldea&#39;s library.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> It is so painful to watch that it took my breath away.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> It tells the story of children still too young to attend school who are forced by their cruel parents to go on a trip to procure supplies.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> It has everything. Trials, tribulations, tears, twists, triumph... I could watch it forever.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Jason&#39;s journey to find the Golden Fleece was nothing compared to what these poor children endured!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s...really saying something.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Aw come on, that&#39;s not fair to Jason.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> You should know that, Atalante, seeing how you were one of the Argonauts.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Hmph... You have always been too soft when it comes to sailors.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> That is why you are always so put upon.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Ghh...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Haha...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Were Circe and Atalante always such good friends?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Good question. It does seem like they get along very well.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> ...Did you hear that?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Well, maybe they have a point.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> We didn&#39;t have a lot of contact in our own time, but that might have been for the best.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I don&#39;t suppose you&#39;d tell us about the time you two met?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A story from Greek mythology? I&#39;d love to hear that as well.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Hmm. A story about the good old days, huh?</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> I... I would rather...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Fine with me! Anything for my darling Piglet!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Though it was nothing grand enough to be recorded in poems or stories passed down through the ages.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Let&#39;s see... Our story begins long before the Trojan War was a glimmer in anyone&#39;s eye...</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><pre><code>	\u2013 Aeaea Island \u2013
</code></pre><p><strong>Piglets:</strong> Oink, oiiink! (Squealing and sobbing)</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> There, there. I know it hurt. You must&#39;ve been so scared. But it&#39;s all okay now.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Circe, tell me, what business does a famed witch have with us?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> A warning! What else!? Listen up, Jason, captain of the Argo!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> As long as you&#39;re staying on this island, you&#39;re free to fish anything you want from the sea, or to pick any of the fruit of this land.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> But do not lay so much as a finger on this island&#39;s animals!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Remember, this island is my domain. If you, or any of your Argonauts, should break my rules...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ...you&#39;ll be lucky to escape with your lives, let alone a repaired boat!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> ...Duly noted.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Damn, and here I thought I&#39;d finally get some steak for the first time in ages... Guess it&#39;s back to wyvern jerky.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Hey! You two! Put those pigs back where you found them!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Huh? Are you talking to me?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> That&#39;s right. You&#39;re Fujimaru and...Mashaea, was it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Long time no see, Jason.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Huh?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> The hell&#39;re you talking about, creep? We just saw each other this morning.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> That goes for you too, Mashaea, or whatever your name was. Got it?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Mashaea? Senpai, when did we become sailors?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Does this mean we&#39;ve joined Jason and become members of the Argonauts now?</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> That is correct. Still...it is quite a shame...</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Had I known what would happen, I would have strangled this prey on the spot...</p><p><strong>Piglets:</strong> O-oiiink!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> So... You&#39;re the one who set a trap for my precious piglets!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ...Wait. Why would you even do that after I made some kykeon to welcome you all!?</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> How stupid do you think we must be to accept a gift from the witch of Aeaea Island at face value?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Hehe, I believe you mean QUEEN Witch!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Exactly.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> We didn&#39;t sail all this way just to have you poison us and make off with our treasure.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Hey, I wouldn&#39;t do that! For one thing, I&#39;d never lay a hand on my own brother&#39;s treasure.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Treasure...? Do you mean the king of Colchis&#39;s most prized possession?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> No way... The Golden Fleece!?</p><hr><p><strong>Jason:</strong> None other.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> After everything my crew and I have been through, you&#39;d better believe we&#39;re going to be on our guard.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Though I guess it&#39;s no surprise you two wouldn&#39;t know that, since you only just joined us.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...So then, we must be in the middle of the Argo&#39;s voyage to bring the Golden Fleece back from Colchis.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> As I recall, during that voyage, Zeus got angry and hurled a tremendous storm at the Argo...</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Correct.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Med\u2013Queen Medea killing her younger brother, Prince Apsyrtus, was the catalyst for his wrath.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Once he learned of this crime, Zeus flew into a rage.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> He struck the Argo with lightning, battered it with great waves, and plunged it into a storm so fierce the keel was nearly torn apart.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> The only reason we managed to barely survive was my mastery of the sail and rudder...</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> ...as well as the courage of my loyal Argonauts.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> ...I expect Castor and Pollux&#39;s pleas must have reached Zeus&#39;s ears.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...So what happened to Medea?</p><hr><p><strong>Jason:</strong> She&#39;s inside the Argo&#39;s wreck over on the beach.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> She shut herself up in the cabin after she killed Apsyrtus and hasn&#39;t spoken to anyone since.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> The only exception she will make is for our rostrum oak from Dodona.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> The oak from Dodona... You mean the talking wood that&#39;s only found in the land of Zeus&#39;s oracle?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> So she&#39;d rather talk to a piece of lumber than you or your crew? Aren&#39;t you ashamed of that!?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> ...Ohhh, right. Technically, you&#39;re my aunt-in-law, aren&#39;t you, Circe?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> And here I still haven&#39;t thanked you properly.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> If you&#39;re gonna call me your aunt, then you&#39;d better take good care of Medea.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ...I wouldn&#39;t have even let you near Aeaea Island if she hadn&#39;t been on your ship.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Zeus will eventually get over his rage, but the Argo will still be cursed.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> It&#39;s only a matter of time until you run into more foul weather, or get stranded somewhere else. Just look how beat-up your ship is.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> How many times have you wrecked that thing? Forget repairing it; you should just throw it away and find a new one.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Wha...!? Don&#39;t be ridiculous! I can&#39;t do that!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> The Argo is my ship! It&#39;s going to guide me back to my home of Thessaly!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> ...Now, now, easy there, Jason.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...? Who&#39;s that...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (A young man in impressive clothing just showed up...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (Is that a human...or a demigod? Who is that?)</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong> If you continue such drastic repairs, your ship will, in essence, become a new vessel.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Should that come to pass, would you still call it your beloved Argo?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Of course I could. It&#39;s the only ship worthy of being with me for my whole life.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> I won&#39;t let it go no matter what, not even if it gets smashed from bow to stern.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Of course that&#39;s your answer. I suppose that is one way for a hero of the sea to live...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...Now then. Circe, beautiful ruler of Aeaea Island, goddess of mercy with the wisdom and providence of Artemis...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...I apologize for not introducing myself sooner. It is a genuine pleasure to make your acquaintance.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Oh? Well now, I can&#39;t remember the last time someone paid me the proper respects. Hehe.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> I wonder who that is? No...hang on...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Those Ionian looks... That tropical accent...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> And that expensive himation with the pattern reserved strictly for royalty...!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> I know...who you are. I think I know your name, too...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> You&#39;re...the king of Athens!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...Indeed I am. I&#39;m honored that you know of me. But right now, I&#39;m just Jason&#39;s friend and fellow Argonaut.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Well no wonder the Argo&#39;s cursed if it&#39;s got guys like you on board!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> I...I can&#39;t believe you have the guts to show your face before me, Theseus!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Theseus...! The heroic young king of Athens...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> He&#39;s been on board the Argo this whole time?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I-I believe so.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;ve heard that name before.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes... I&#39;m sure you have, Senpai.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> He&#39;s the hero who made his way through the great labyrinth of Crete and defeated the Minotaur.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> A hero, huh... Yeah, maybe.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Theseus did help my sister, Pasipha\xEB, wrap up one of her loose moral ends.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> After he escaped from the labyrinth, I heard he took her daughter, my niece, Princess Ariadne...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ...who was, I would add, the spitting image of her mother, as his bride.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> And yet, for some reason, I haven&#39;t heard anything more about Ariadne after that happened. Not a peep.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Instead, all I&#39;ve heard is how the king of Athens recently welcomed a new queen to his palace.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ...Why is that, Theseus? What was so wrong with Ariadne that she couldn&#39;t be your queen?</p><p><strong>Theseus:</strong> ...I still love Ariadne, even now. I&#39;m more grateful to her than you know.</p><p><strong>Theseus:</strong> But unfortunately, she had no intention of bearing me an heir.</p><p><strong>Theseus:</strong> As a man, I could accept that choice and respect it.</p><p><strong>Theseus:</strong> But as the king of Athens, this created a problem that I had to solve.</p><p><strong>Theseus:</strong> Much as I wish it weren&#39;t, that is part of my kingly duty. I am so sorry.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ...Ghh...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> I swear! What is it about my family that makes heroes everywhere just wanna mess with us?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> ...That&#39;s enough, Theseus. Step down. I&#39;m plenty calm now.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> I trust you understand why I didn&#39;t want you and Circe running into each other?</p><p><strong>Theseus:</strong> Yes, I do, Jason. I&#39;m sorry for overstepping my bounds.</p><p><strong>Theseus:</strong> I&#39;ll get back to supervising repairs on the Argo.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> ...Circe, Queen Witch, it is too soon for you to lose hope and curse us.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> You have Medea.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> She speaks of you often, and clearly has fond memories of you as her teacher.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> And right now, Medea wants nothing more than to see the Argo&#39;s voyage completed.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> I know she is not here asking you for help, but I also know that is what she wants.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Indeed. Atalante is absolutely right, Circe.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> So I ask you now, as the leader of the Argonauts: please, help us return to the sea.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> For my wife&#39;s\u2013for Medea&#39;s\u2013sake as much as ours.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ...I guess my bloodline was just fated to be the plaything of gods and heroes alike.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> I actually did not care a great deal about all of that.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> I only wished that Medea&#39;s twisted romance would hurry and end, so she may find happiness again.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...So then, Circe did go on to honor Jason&#39;s request and help the Argonauts.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m impressed Jason pulled that off. Talk about a model hero.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> So, that&#39;s how you shamelessly sweet talk someone intogiving you what you want. Good to know.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So...what happened next?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> According to myth, the Argo continued its voyage for quite some time after that, right?</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Indeed. And that is exactly what happened.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> However...Circe was dead set on getting Medea to resolve the situation for herself.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> She kept trying to wake her up to the disaster she had invited and face up to it.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> ...At least, that is what you were trying to do, was it not?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ...Yeah, it was. Not that it did any good.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> My former pupil refused to see me, even after I came to the Argo in person.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> She refused to open up, and wouldn&#39;t let anyone besides Jason come near her.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Honestly, I&#39;m not even sure Jason&#39;s attempts to console her got through.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Eventually, I just ended up waving my wand to dispel the Argo&#39;s curse.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ...All right, listen up, brave Argonauts.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Let&#39;s go over the dispelling ritual one more time.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> This elixir I whipped up will make ephemeral concepts corporeal for a short while.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Once you sprinkle it over the hull, it&#39;ll make its curse something you can touch\u2013or, more to the point, hit.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> If you can defeat the curse before the elixir&#39;s effects run out, the Argo should then be free of it for good.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> But be warned: if you fail to defeat it, it&#39;ll get even stronger and come back to haunt this ship with a vengeance.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> So the curse will take the form of a monster, huh. I suppose it being only one monster would be too much to hope for?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> If not, that&#39;s where Theseus&#39;ll come in!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Now that Heracles is gone, there&#39;s no one else on the crew who can match his might. Haaahaha!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Are you nuts? I&#39;d rather die than ask Theseus for help.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> So, before it comes to that...I&#39;m willing to lend a hand myself.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> You? For real? Are you sure you even know how to fight, grandma?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> You&#39;re the last person I want to hear that from!</p><p><strong>Theseus:</strong> I think it&#39;s wonderful that you&#39;ll be joining the fray.</p><p><strong>Theseus:</strong> I only hope that the ship doesn&#39;t get wrecked again now that it&#39;s almost repaired.</p><p><strong>Theseus:</strong> Also there&#39;re some ominous clouds making their way toward this island. If the seas start acting up, there&#39;s no telling what might happen to the ship.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> It&#39;s the curse pulling those storm clouds here. How is that a surprise? Of course the gods aren&#39;t gonna be thrilled about this, you jagoff.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Nonetheless...I swear to Hecate that your sails will be filled with wind again.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Now come on, Jason, grab your sword and help us!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Grab my sword? I&#39;ve got my hands full just keeping Medea&#39;s cabin safe!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Are you serious!? This is YOUR ship! You are sincerely dedicated to being a complete dick, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> It is nothing new for him. If any monsters try to escape, I will take care of them.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Fujimaru, Mashaea, I would appreciate your help as well.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> R-right...! I&#39;d be glad to!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be any help whatsoever, but I&#39;ll do what I can.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ...Good to hear.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...I&#39;m worried about Medea.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Jason:</strong> There, now that I&#39;ve finished off this bottle of wine, let&#39;s get to the beach and do this thing!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Okay Argonauts, go forth and get our home back!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Haaa!</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> There, that takes care of all the monsters on the deck!</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Now we just need to take care of the ones in the hold. What are your orders, Jason!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Well, uh, I&#39;m afraid...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Jason got hit by a barrel of apples and knocked out...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Jason died a hero&#39;s death in defense of his ship, I hear.</p><hr><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Again, hmm. Very well then, we will just have to finish this ourselves.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Circe...? ...Ah...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ...So, you&#39;ve finally shown yourself before me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh? Medea&#39;s...commanding the curse monsters...?</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> What... What is the meaning of this, Medea...!?</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Hello, Circe, Atalante... Did you come here to laugh at me while I was bawling my eyes out?</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Or perhaps to admonish me for my sins...?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ...Medea...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ...No, nothing like that. I&#39;m here to celebrate this new chapter in your life.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> New chapter...?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Just as I will never again be seen merely as a priestess...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ...Medea, you too have become a woman to be feared as a witch.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> So of course you&#39;re gonna mess other people&#39;s lives up something fierce. You can&#39;t help it! You&#39;re a witch!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Go ahead and seduce any man you want, then toss him aside when you&#39;re done!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> That&#39;s one of the best parts of being a witch, you know. You should be proud that you&#39;re worth that.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Although, I gotta say...you don&#39;t look all that happy about this to me.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> I can see you&#39;re smiling while we stand here, but I can also tell you&#39;re crying on the inside, and I have to say I don&#39;t like that.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> These curses come from me... They&#39;re my sins made manifest.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> So I&#39;ll take them with me when I go.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> I cannot let you get away with that, Medea. Those curses will not stop until they sink this ship.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Medea...</p><hr><p><strong>Circe:</strong> (Sigh)... How many times did I tell you to learn the medicinal arts too, Medea?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Hecate&#39;s medicinal arts don&#39;t just heal the body. They have a powerful effect on the heart, too.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> But only if you spent time devoting yourself to the study of how the heart works while learning them.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> If you do that, it&#39;s a wonderful way to tame the monsters lurking in your heart.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> For a disciple of Hecate, I gotta say...I&#39;m disappointed in myself for releasing such a half-assed witch into the world.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ...This is exactly why I didn&#39;t want to take on an apprentice in the first place.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> But, now that we&#39;re here, I guess this scuffle&#39;s as good a time as any to teach you one last lesson!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...(Gulp)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So...what happened to the Argo then?</p><hr><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Nothing, Piglet. There were no more mishaps, happenings, or even minor inconveniences worth mentioning after that.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> The Argonauts defeated every monster on board the ship and dispelled Medea&#39;s self-destructive curse.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> After that, I thanked them, threw them a big kykeon farewell party, and sent them on their merry way.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> And you already know the rest from the myth.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> All right, you have your own stuff to take care of, right, Master? Go on then, get out of here.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> That&#39;s it for today&#39;s kykeon party.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um, Circe? I really do appreciate you telling us that story, but...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...you&#39;re sitting on Senpai&#39;s bed...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Hey! Where do you think you&#39;re going with that pillow!? Put it back! Don&#39;t you click your tongue at me!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ...(Sulk)</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> I have rarely seen your lips so loose, falcon witch.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> I never expected you to discuss your past in such detail.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ...Well, so what? Felt like it, so I did.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> That&#39;s all water under the bridge for Medea and me anyway.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Hm...? What is it? Why&#39;re you looking at me like that?</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Let us say...hypothetically...</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> ...you encountered the hero of your dreams once more. What would you do?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Wh-what kind of stupid question is that?</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> ...I am merely curious. I have no real experience in romance myself.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> And as such, I cannot imagine what it is to be driven mad by it, as Medea was.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Granted, the odds of that happening are vanishingly small, and so likely not worth considering...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Hehe, oh, I wouldn&#39;t say that.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> I&#39;m not the same old Circe I used to be. You don&#39;t really think I&#39;d make the same mistake all over again, do you?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> In fact, you&#39;ve got the whole thing back asswards. He&#39;s the one that would end up falling for me, the Queen Witch.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Who&#39;s falling for who now?</p><hr><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Bwaaa!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> P-Piglet! Where the hell&#39;d you come from!? Don&#39;t scare me like that!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Huh? You&#39;re just going to the bathroom? You can&#39;t go in your own room &#39;cause you feel like someone&#39;s watching you?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> K-kind of an overshare, isn&#39;t it!? Go on, get out of here!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ...Phew...</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> So, you would make him fall in love with you... You are nothing if not confident, witch of Aeaea.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ...Hell yeah I am!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Hehe. Still, that said...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> If I&#39;d just stayed a hermit out on my island...I&#39;d never have learned to be so recklessly confident.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> So I&#39;m grateful to Pig\u2013I mean, Master for that.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Hmm. That&#39;s nice. (Munch, munch)</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Wha...</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Hey, you&#39;re the one who started all this. Isn&#39;t it kinda rude for you to just shut down like that?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> I guess you didn&#39;t really care after all...</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> ...?</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> ...The Oak of Dodona once told me something while it let me listen to the ocean wind through its knothole.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> It said love would paddle in from far overseas and drop an anchor deep within your heart.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ...Hmm... A divine prophecy, huh.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Whoever heard of a piece of wood being an oracle? Is it a dryad with a direct hotline to the gods or something?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Anyway, that said...I hope it&#39;s right! Wherever the tree gets its info from, I am definitely a fan of this prophecy.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> I know there&#39;s a much better guy for you out there.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Jason might have the makings of a hero, but he&#39;s got a long way to go before\u2013</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> Um, Auntie...? That prophecy? It was about you.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Bwa?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ...H-hey, tree, who told you you could go making predictions about my future, huh!?</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> The Oak also said...</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> ...that a hero you would never forget would come visit Aeaea Island one day.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> ...Stop that. I&#39;m the Queen Witch, remember?</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> This isn&#39;t funny. I&#39;m a disciple of Hecate herself. No way I&#39;m letting Zeus pull that kind of stunt!</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> ...Of course.</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> Hey, Medea, look!</p><p><strong>Circe:</strong> The sailors are praying to Zephyr as we speak. It won&#39;t be long before you set sail again.</p><p><strong>Medea Lily:</strong> ...I know.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1ACirce:</strong> ...Well, my defiant disciple, this is the last piece of advice I have for you.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1ACirce:</strong> Stay on my island.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1ACirce:</strong> The Argo&#39;s curse is gone. I&#39;ve washed away its stain.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1ACirce:</strong> The Argonauts can handle the rest of their journey without you.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1ACirce:</strong> And nobody from Colchis would ever come looking for you here.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> I&#39;m sorry, Auntie, but I can&#39;t do that.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> You saw what happened for yourself, right? Jason needs me.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> Besides...</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> ...I don&#39;t want to be just a footnote in history like Ariadne.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1ACirce:</strong> ...I see. Well then, I guess there&#39;s nothing left to say but goodbye.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> I guess not. Take care of yourself, Auntie.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> Even though I&#39;ll be staying on, I pray you&#39;ll find the kind of love that would make me insanely jealous.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1ACirce:</strong> ...Hehe.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1ACirce:</strong> You never change, do you!</p>`,408),a=[s];function i(g,h){return e(),o("div",null,a)}var l=t(n,[["render",i],["__file","Circe.html.vue"]]);export{l as default};
