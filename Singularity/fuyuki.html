Fou...Fou!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...What&#39;s that sound?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...Feels like something just licked my cheek...</p><hr><p><strong>A：???:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong> ...Umm. Since it&#39;s neither morning nor night, please wake up, Senpai.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Who are you?</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong> That&#39;s a hard question to answer suddenly. Maybe I&#39;m not important enough for you to know my name?</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong> No, I do have a name. I have a proper name.</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong> But I never really had the chance to use it... I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t leave a good first impression...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Where are we?</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong> Right. That&#39;s a simple question. I really appreciate it.</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong> This is the passageway from the front gate to the Central Command Room, which is in front of the Main Chaldea Gate.</p><hr><p><strong>A：???:</strong> ...Ahem. Anyway, can I ask you a question, Senpai?</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong> You were asleep, but I don&#39;t see why you&#39;d sleep in the hall. Can you not sleep unless you&#39;re on a hard bed?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Was I sleeping here?</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong> Yes, like a log. It was such a deep sleep, it was almost textbook.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Yes. I can&#39;t sleep unless I&#39;m on a straw mat.</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong> Oh, a Japanese carpet. I&#39;ve heard of those before. I see...I see.</p><hr><p><strong>C：???:</strong> Fou! Kyuuu! Kyao!</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong> ...I completely forgot. I still haven&#39;t introduced you yet, have I, Fou?</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong> This squirrel-like creature is Fou. He&#39;s a Privileged Life-Form allowed to freely walk around Chaldea.</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong> Fou led me here, and that&#39;s how I ran into you, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou. Mmkyu, Fou!</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong> He ran off somewhere again. He does that sometimes, just walks around.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...I&#39;ve never seen an animal like that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...What a mysterious creature.</p><hr><p><strong>A：???:</strong> Yes, normally he doesn&#39;t go near anyone aside from me, but he seems to like you, Senpai.</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong> Congratulations. Now you shall be the second caretaker of Fou in Chaldea.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong> Ah, there you are, Mash. That won&#39;t do, you know, wandering about without permission...</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong> Oh, someone&#39;s already with you? You&#39;re... I see...The rookie who just got assigned here.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> I&#39;m Lev Lainur, one of the technicians employed here.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> And your name is?</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Hmm, Fujimaru. So you&#39;re the last of the 48 candidates.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Welcome to Chaldea. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re here.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> I heard you were selected out of many public applicants, how long was your training? A year? 6 months? 3 months?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...I&#39;ll leave that to your imagination.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> I see that you already know how competitive it is in here. You&#39;re going to hide your info from your rivals?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Dr. Lev, Fujimaru&#39;s training was less than a few hours. I think it&#39;s from embarrassment.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Oh? Well, now...I see. We had an emergency opening for applicants to fill out numbers.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> No, I didn&#39;t go through any training.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Oh? So you&#39;re a complete amateur?</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Right...Come to think of it, we did call for applicants just to fill numbers.</p><hr><p><strong>Lev:</strong> So you&#39;re one of them? Do forgive me, I was inconsiderate.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> But please don&#39;t be discouraged because you&#39;re a public applicant. We need all of you for this mission.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> 38 elite mages, plus 10 talented public applicants... Somehow, we were able to gather all possible candidates.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> That&#39;s something to rejoice over. This year, 2017, all possible candidates capable of Spiritron Dives were brought to Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> If there&#39;s something you don&#39;t understand, feel free to ask Mash or myself anytime...Hmm?</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Come to think of it, what were you talking about with [♂ him /♀ her], Mash? That&#39;s not like you. Did you know each other before?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No, I&#39;d never met Senpai before. I saw Senpai sleeping here, so I just...</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Sleeping? Fujimaru was asleep, here?</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Ahh, you went through the simulation when you entered, right? Spiritron Dives can get to you if you&#39;re not used to them.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> After the simulation, the gate must&#39;ve opened and you walked over here before you returned to consciousness.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> It&#39;s a type of sleep-walking. When you fell, Fujimaru, that was when Mash spoke to you.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> You seem to be fine, but I&#39;d like to take you to the infirmary just in case...</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Sorry, hang in there a little longer. The Director&#39;s orientation is about to start. You should hurry over.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Director?</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> The Director&#39;s the director. The person in charge of Chaldea, and the commander of our special missions.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Since you&#39;re a rookie from the public, you may have only seen the pamphlet?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It would appear so. Since the Director&#39;s profile hasn&#39;t been made public.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai has no connection to the Director. Only mages from families that have been around for over a century show respect to the Animusphere name.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Right. Well, whether you know the Director or not, it doesn&#39;t affect your work as a Master, so it&#39;s not a problem.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> But it&#39;s good to not get on her bad side. If you wish to work in a peaceful environment, better hurry.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> There&#39;s an orientation by the Director at the Central Command Room in 5 minutes. She&#39;s putting on a presentation for the newbies.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Orientation?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, to greet the Master candidates assigned here today like you, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> In other words, it&#39;s for the big boss to welcome the careless newbies.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Since the Director is not the type to forgive and forget, if you show up late, you&#39;ll be on her radar for the entire year.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> The orientation begins in five minutes in the Central Command Room. Go straight down this hall. Hurry.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Dr. Lev, do you think I&#39;ll be allowed to sit in on the orientation, too?</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Hmm? Well, if you stand way back in a corner, I think she&#39;ll look the other way...But why?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I just thought I should take Senpai to the Command Room. It&#39;s possible that Senpai might fall asleep on the way again.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> ...If I leave you alone like this the Director might yell at me...I should tag along as well, eh?</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Well, if that&#39;s what you want to do, Mash, go ahead. You okay with that Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> If you have no other questions, let&#39;s head to the Command Room. Is there anything else you want to know?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I have no questions.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> All right, let&#39;s get going. Stand up straight, but remember to relax, okay?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Why is she calling me Senpai?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Oh, don&#39;t worry about it. To her, every human your age is her senpai.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> But it&#39;s unusual to hear her actually call someone that. This might be the first time.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Actually, I&#39;m intrigued. Say, Mash, why do you call [♂ him /♀ her] Senpai?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The reason? Fujimaru is the most human-like person I&#39;ve ever met.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Hmm. Which means?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I don&#39;t feel threatened. So there&#39;s no reason for me to be hostile.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> I see, that is important! People at Chaldea are all a piece of work!</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> I agree with you, Mash. I think you two will get along just fine!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...If you like Senpai Dr. Lev, the Director will probably hate Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Well, why don&#39;t we hide in the restroom to boycott the orientation, then?</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> That will only make the Director more upset. We&#39;re going to have to leave it to fate.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Shall we jump into the lions&#39; den, Fujimaru? Hey, once you get used to her, she can be a pretty sweet person.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This is the Central Command Room. Your number, Senpai...Single digit, you&#39;re in the front row.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Take an empty seat in the front row. ...Senpai? You&#39;re looking a bit pale...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Sorry, I&#39;m starting to space out again...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...Sleepy ...So sleepy.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s an after effect of the simulator. I wish I could take you to the infirmary...</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> No more small talk. See, the orientation&#39;s already begun.</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong> Well, that wasn&#39;t on time, but looks like we&#39;re all here now.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Welcome to Special Organization, Chaldea. I&#39;m the director, Olga Marie Animusphere.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> You have been selected, or discovered from each nation for your rare—</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Are you all right, Senpai?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Uh-oh.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...Wait, was I asleep?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. It seemed like you were in REM sleep...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Anyway, the Director&#39;s slap seemed to wake you up completely. Thank goodness.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You&#39;ve been left out of the first mission, Senpai. I was taking you back to your room—Oh!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> A squirrel on your face!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Watch out!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No, no, this is normal. No problem at all!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Fou likes to attack my face, slide around to my back, and settle on my shoulder.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So you&#39;re used to that, huh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. It&#39;s been a year since Fou came to live here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Wait, are you the one who named him?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s right. No special reason, the word &quot;Fou&quot; is the first thing that popped into my mind.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m impressed you knew that, Senpai. I see you&#39;re quite perceptive yourself.</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou. Kuuu, Fou! Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Hmm, hmm. Apparently, Fou&#39;s embraced you as one of his own, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But can a squirrel who sees humans as rivals exist in this world?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> He sees me as a rival?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Don&#39;t look at me, I have no idea</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Well, knowing Fou as I do, I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll forget it by tomorrow.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Actually, we&#39;ve reached our destination. This is your room, Senpai.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...I see. Thanks for coming all this way.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s fine. If you ask me, Senpai, I wouldn&#39;t mind even if it&#39;s treating you to lunch.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What team are you on, Mash?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> First Mission, A Team. Speaking of which, I&#39;ve got to head back now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Kyu...Kyu!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Fou says he&#39;ll look after you, Senpai. That sets my mind at ease.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Now, then, I&#39;m off. If we&#39;re lucky, I think we&#39;ll meet again.</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong> Okay, I&#39;m in here—Wait? Whaaaaaat? Who are you?</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong> This is an empty room! It&#39;s where I slack off! Who gave you permission to come in?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I was told that this was my room...</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong> Your room? This place? Oh... I see, so the last one finally showed up, huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Well, who are you?</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong> Who am I? Isn&#39;t it obvious that I&#39;m a healthy, diligent and hard-working doctor?</p><hr><p><strong>B：???:</strong> Well, nice to meet you, Fujimaru. Didn&#39;t think I would run into you like this, but let me introduce myself again.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;m the head of the medical department, Romani Archaman. For some reason, people just call me Dr. Roman.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I don&#39;t know why, but it&#39;s easier to pronounce, so go ahead and call me Roman.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Fact is, Roman has a nice ring to it, no? It sounds cool and vaguely sweet.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Nice to meet you, Doctor.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Yes, nice to meet you. I look forward to getting to know you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...Oh, so you&#39;re the fluffy type?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Fluffy? Oh, you mean my hair? I&#39;m normally pretty busy so I just let it grow.</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Huh? On your shoulder - is that the mysterious creature I&#39;ve heard so much about? Whoa, nice to meet you!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Mash told me a lot about him, but I didn&#39;t really think he existed...Hey, why don&#39;t I teach him some tricks?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Okay, shake hand. If you do it well, I&#39;ll give you a snack.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> ...Fou.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Huh, what? He gave me a really pitying look and then completely ignored me...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> A-Anyway, I think I get what&#39;s going on.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> You&#39;re the rookie who just got here then got on the Director&#39;s bad side?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Then you and I are alike. Just so you know, I got yelled at by her too.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> You know the Rayshift experiment&#39;s about to start, right? The entire staff&#39;s been sent to help out.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> But since my job is to look after everyone&#39;s health. I had nothing to do.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The machines are more accurate at reading the vitals of the mages who are in the Coffins.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The Director said, &quot;When you&#39;re here, Romani, everyone slacks off! &quot; Then she threw me out. So I&#39;ve been sulking here.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> But that&#39;s when you showed up. This is what they called a blessing in disguise right?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Since we both have nowhere to go, why don&#39;t we spend some time and deepen our friendship!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Sure. This is my room, anyhow.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Yeah. So that means I&#39;m visiting a friend&#39;s room! Woo hoo! I&#39;ve made a new friend!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It&#39;s not like I&#39;m a loner.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Hey...You already have a friend even though you just got here...What a people person! I want in!</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...So that&#39;s the structure of Chaldea. An underground workshop built on a snowy mountain 6,000 meters above sea level...</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Romani, we&#39;re going to start the Rayshift soon. Could you come in case there&#39;s an emergency?</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> The A Team&#39;s in perfect condition, but B Team on down is less experienced and they are displaying some slight abnormalities.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> It probably comes from anxiety. The inside of that Coffin is like a cockpit.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Hey Lev, I feel bad for them. Why don&#39;t I give them some anesthesia?</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Yeah, hurry up, will you? If you&#39;re in the infirmary, then you can get here in two minutes.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> This isn&#39;t the infirmary, is it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...but you&#39;re just hiding and slacking...</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Whoa...Please don&#39;t mention that... It&#39;s gonna take five minutes from here, no matter what...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Well, I think they&#39;ll forgive me for being a little late. A Team has no issues anyway.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Oh, that guy&#39;s named Lev Lainur.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> He&#39;s the mage who created the Near-Future Observation Lens, Sheba— A telescope used to observe that pseudo-planet, Chaldeas.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Sheba not only observes Chaldeas, but also serves as a surveillance system for most of this facility.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Also, it was the previous director who built the summoning/unsummoning system, which is the foundation of the Rayshift tech.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> To actualize that theory, the Pseudo-Spiritron Calculation Engine, (basically a super computer) was provided by the Atlas Academy.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> All these different talents have been gathered to carry out this mission.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It&#39;s pointless for an ordinary doctor like me to be there, but if I&#39;m summoned, I must go.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Thanks for chatting with me, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> When you get settled in, come by the infirmary. Next time, I&#39;ll treat you to some yummy cake.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> What&#39;s this? The lights are out. Did something—</p><p><strong>Announcement A:</strong> Emergency. Emergency. A fire has broken out in the Central Power Station and the Central Command Room.</p><p><strong>Announcement A:</strong> Central Area&#39;s containment wall will activate in 90 seconds.

What on earth is happening?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Monitor, show us the Command Room! Is everybody all right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...So awful...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...Command Room? What about Mash?</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> What&#39;s this—</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Fujimaru, evacuate right now. I&#39;m going to the Command Room.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The containment wall is about to close. Get yourself out before it&#39;s too late!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I can&#39;t just run away now...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I know. Let&#39;s go save Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Wait, what are you doing? Wrong way, Gate 2&#39;s over there!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re coming with me? Sure the more helping hands the better, but...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Oh man, there&#39;s no time to argue! Make sure you get back before it&#39;s too late!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...No survivors. Only Chaldeas is safe.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> This was where the explosion originated. This was no accident, it was sabotage.</p><p><strong>Announcement A:</strong> Generator operation stopped. Power level critical.</p><p><strong>Announcement A:</strong> Switch to the backup generator, error. Please make switch manually.</p><p><strong>Announcement A:</strong> Containment wall will close in 40 seconds Those remain in Central Area, evacuate immediately—</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...I&#39;m heading down to the underground power station. We can&#39;t let Chaldea&#39;s light go out.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Hurry up and go back the way we came. You can still make it.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Listen, don&#39;t stop anywhere on the way! Go outside, and wait for help!</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Announcement B:</strong> System switching to the final phase of Rayshift.

You can&#39;t...save...me. Don&#39;t mind me, please...Run.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (With those wounds, she&#39;s...)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...That&#39;s right, thank you...For your understanding.

First, take a look around you, please.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Did you just say, &quot;I will kill you? &quot;</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That came out wrong. What I meant to say was, &quot;you&#39;re going to be killed. &quot;</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um, I was confused because everything happened so quickly.

You and I will overcome this together!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> —phew. I had my worries, but we made it somehow.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Are you hurt Senpai? Does your stomach hurt, or does it feel heavy?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What was that?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I don&#39;t know. Something that doesn&#39;t exist in our era, let alone this era.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That was the cause of the Singularity, or something like it. I guess calling it that isn&#39;t too far off, or maybe it is.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Mash, you&#39;re that powerful?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...No, in combat training I always had to stay after class. I couldn&#39;t even do a pull-up.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The reason I was able to fight like that just now—</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Right, I finally got through! Hello? This is Chaldea Command Room? Do you read me?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This is Mash Kyrielight, a member of A Team. At this time, I&#39;ve completed the shift to Singularity F.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> My sole companion is Fujimaru. Mind and body both intact.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Rayshift compatibility, Master compatibility both satisfactory. Please register Fujimaru as an official researcher.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...So Fujimaru also got dragged into the Rayshift, huh?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;m impressed you didn&#39;t &quot;lose your existence. &quot; I&#39;m really glad.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Also, Mash...Of course I&#39;m glad you&#39;re safe, too... But what&#39;s up with that outfit?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It&#39;s shameless! I didn&#39;t raise you to dress like that!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I transformed into this. I couldn&#39;t protect Senpai wearing Chaldea&#39;s uniform.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> What do you mean by transformed, Mash? Did you hit your head? Or was it that...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> —Dr. Roman. Please be quiet.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Please check my condition. I think you&#39;ll understand the situation better.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Your physical condition? Wh-Whoa, whoa, whoa, WHOA!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Physical strength, Magical Circuits, everything&#39;s improved! You&#39;re not so much a human, but—</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, I&#39;m a Servant.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I don&#39;t remember how it happened, but it seems I have survived by fusing with a Servant.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> To investigate and resolve Singularity F, a Servant was provided in advance at Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This Servant lost its Master in that explosion, and was doomed to vanish.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But at the last second, he offered me a contract.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> In return for the abilities and Noble Phantasm of a Heroic Spirit, he wanted me to eliminate the cause of this Singularity.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> A Heroic Spirit and a human, fused... A Demi-Servant? That&#39;s Chaldea&#39;s sixth experiment.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I see. So it finally succeeded, huh? Does this Heroic Spirit still have his consciousness?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...No, he gave me his combat abilities then vanished.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> He never revealed his True Name even at the end. So I don&#39;t even know whose Heroic Spirit I am...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Nor what kind of Noble Phantasm I&#39;m holding. At this point there&#39;s too much I don&#39;t know.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Hey, look on the bright side. Not every Servant who gets summoned is cooperative.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Now that you&#39;re a Servant, this is in our favor. After all, you&#39;re completely trustworthy.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Fujimaru, it looks like you&#39;re the only one who Rayshifted there safely.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Also, I am sorry. Forcing you into this without any explanation.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;m sure you&#39;re full of questions, but try not to worry.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> You&#39;ve already got a powerful weapon. Humanity&#39;s most powerful weapon - Mash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I don&#39;t know about &quot;most powerful. &quot; I&#39;m the one who gets blamed later.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Now, now, as long as Fujimaru understands that&#39;s what a Servant is, it&#39;ll be fine.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> But Fujimaru, while Servants can be reliable allies, they also have a weakness.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> They disappear without their magical energy source. Their Master.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;m still analyzing the data, but it&#39;s indicating that Mash has become your Servant.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Meaning that you&#39;re Mash&#39;s Master.

I never explained what Masters and Servants are to you, anyway.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Now&#39;s a good time, I&#39;ll explain it to you in detail. The current mission has two new goals...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Doctor, you&#39;re breaking up. 10 seconds until the connection is lost.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Huh, so Sheba&#39;s output is unstable because we switched to the backup generators? Oh well, I&#39;ll brief you later.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Both of you, I&#39;m getting a strong leyline reading about 2 km from where you are.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Try to get there somehow. That way, it will stabilize our connection.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Listen, don&#39;t do anything reckless, will you? I&#39;ll try to bring the power back up as soon as—</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> The connection got cut off.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Well, that&#39;s the Doctor for you. You can&#39;t rely on him in situations like this.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It can&#39;t be helped, let&#39;s get going.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Right, you&#39;re so dependable Senpai. I was actually terrified, so thank goodness.</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Kyu. Fou, Fooou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s right, you&#39;re with us as well, aren&#39;t you Fou? Thank you for cheering us up.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Apparently, Fou Rayshifted here with you Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Ah. But I forgot to let the Doctor know...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Kyu. Fou, kyaao!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> He said, &quot;don&#39;t worry about that guy. &quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You&#39;re right.

I know it&#39;s hard to believe, but the truth is—</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> A Demi-Servant, right? It&#39;s pretty obvious that you fused with a Servant.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> What I want to know is why it&#39;s successful now all of a sudden!</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Enough of that. You! The civilian who showed up late to my speech!</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong> !?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> How did you become a Master? Only first-class Mages can enter contracts with Servants!</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> There&#39;s no way you could ever become a Master! What did you do to her to have her do your bidding?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You are way off base!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Well, don&#39;t look at me...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> There&#39;s a misunderstanding, Director. I&#39;m actually the one who forced the contract.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> What did you say?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;ll explain how it happened. That way we can understand each other&#39;s situation better.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...And that&#39;s how it happened. We were dragged into a Rayshift, and teleported here to Fuyuki.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No other Master candidates shifted with us. You&#39;re the only human we&#39;ve run into, Director.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But this gives me hope. If you&#39;re here, that means there must be other candidates who got teleported here...</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> ...There aren&#39;t, actually. That much I&#39;m certain of.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> ...I hate to admit it, but I know why we were shifted to Fuyuki.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So you understand why we survived?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> All of us here share a common denominator. Neither me, nor you, nor that one &quot;were actually inside the Coffins. &quot;</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Though Rayshifting flesh and blood isn&#39;t likely to succeed, it&#39;s not impossible.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Meanwhile, the coffins have breakers. When the success rate&#39;s below 95%, the power&#39;s cut off.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> So they never actually Rayshifted. We&#39;re the only ones here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I see. That&#39;s why you&#39;re the director.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You can be reliable when you&#39;re calm, I see.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> What&#39;s that supposed to mean? Are you saying I&#39;m not usually calm?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Huh? You weren&#39;t planning to shift, Director?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> ...Is that a problem? What commander heads to the front lines? Didn&#39;t I tell you that you were my tools?</p><hr><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> ...Hmmph, whatever. I understand the situation now.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Fujimaru, since it&#39;s an emergency I&#39;ll approve you and Kyrielight&#39;s contract.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> From here on out, you&#39;ll follow my commands. First, let&#39;s set up a base camp.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Listen, this is the time to search for a Leyline Terminal. A place where magical energy converges.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> There we&#39;ll be able to contact Chaldea. So in this town&#39;s case...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This is the point, Director. The Ley point is at your feet.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Whoa! Oh r-right, I knew that, I knew that, of course!</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Mash, place your shield on the ground. I&#39;m going to set up a summoning circle, with your Noble Phantasm as the catalyst.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...So she says. Are you all right with that, Senpai?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Sure, go ahead and do it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;m not about letting go of the weapon.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Understood. Now let us begin.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This is...The same as the summoning experiment chamber at Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> CQ, CQ. Hello, hello? Okay, the connection&#39;s back!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Good job, you secured the connection. Now we can communicate again, and even send rations...</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Huh?! Why are you running the show, Romani? What about Lev? Where&#39;s Lev? Put Lev on!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Waaaahhhhhhhhh!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> D-Director, you&#39;re alive? And you&#39;re unharmed? What the...</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> What&#39;s that supposed to mean? Where&#39;s Lev? What&#39;s the head medic doing in charge?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Don&#39;t ask me why. I&#39;m fully aware that I&#39;m not cut out for this job.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> But there&#39;s nobody else, Olga Marie.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Currently, the surviving full time staff of Chaldea is less than twenty people, including me.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The reason I&#39;m in charge of operations is because there&#39;s no one ranked higher than me who survived.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Dr. Lev was supervising from the Command Room. There&#39;s no way he could survive that blast.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> No way—Lev... No, forget that, wait...please wait.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Less than 20 survivors? What about the Master candidates...the coffins?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...47, all in critical condition and we&#39;re short on medical supplies. We might be able to save a few, but all of them might be—</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Don&#39;t be ridiculous! Cryopreserve them immediately! Think about reviving them later. Your top priority is to make sure they don&#39;t die!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I forgot the coffins had those functions! I&#39;ll get on it right away!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...That surprises me. Cryopreservation without prior consent is a crime.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yet you made the decision right away. You put human lives ahead of your own reputation as the director.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Don&#39;t be stupid! As long as they&#39;re not dead, I can explain myself later - why else?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> In the first place, 47 lives... There&#39;s no way can I carry that burden!</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Please don&#39;t die...I&#39;m begging you... If only Lev were here!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...This concludes my report.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Chaldea has lost 80% of its functionality. There&#39;s only so much that the remaining staff can do.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;m shifting available manpower to Rayshift repairs, and maintaining Chaldeas&#39; and Sheba&#39;s current states.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> As soon as external communications are back up, we&#39;ll request supplies and start rebuilding Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> That&#39;s fine. I would&#39;ve done the same if I were there.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> ...Ah. Romani Archaman. I don&#39;t like it, but until I return you&#39;re in charge of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Make the Rayshift repairs your top priority.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> We&#39;ll be investigating this town. The Singularity F.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Director, you&#39;re not afraid to be at ground zero? Since when did you become so brave?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> ...Seriously, you don&#39;t know when to shut up.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> I&#39;d like nothing better than to go back now, but it&#39;s going to take time till you finish the Rayshift repairs.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> This town only contains low-level monsters, with Mash as a Demi-Servant we&#39;ll be safe.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Accident or not, we Animuspheres pride ourselves on doing our best in the situations we&#39;re given.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> I&#39;ll be looking into Singularity F with Fujimaru and Mash Kyrielight as investigators.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> That said, since my field staff is inexperienced, the extent of this mission will be to discover the cause of this anomaly.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Analysis and eradication will have to wait until after Chaldea&#39;s restored, and I can send in a second team. You okay with that?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Only discover it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That would be nice and easy.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Roger that. Best of luck to you, Director.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> We can now communicate in short bursts. Feel free to contact me in an emergency.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> ...Huh! Even if we sent an SOS, nobody would come to our rescue.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Director?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Nothing, I&#39;m cutting off the connection. Go do your job.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Director, are you sure about this? There&#39;s also the option of waiting here for rescue.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> I can&#39;t afford to do that...After we return to Chaldea, who knows how long it will take to select the next team?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> A month won&#39;t be enough to gather personnel or funds. Do you know how much the Association will harass me in the meantime?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Worst case, they&#39;ll blame me for mismanagement, and I&#39;ll lose Chaldea to them.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> If that came to pass, I&#39;d be toast. I can&#39;t go back empty-handed. I need something that will shut them up!</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> ...Sorry, but you&#39;re both stuck with me, Mash, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Come on, let&#39;s explore this town. The cause of this twisted history must be here somewhere.</p><h2 id="section-3-investigate-the-bridge" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3-investigate-the-bridge" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 3: Investigate the Bridge</h2><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Stop. Before we start exploring the city, Fujimaru, isn&#39;t there something you want to say to me?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> No, nothing in particular.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Yeah, nothing in particular.</p><hr><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> ...You&#39;re not very smart are you? Remember what happened in the Command Room?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai, it&#39;s probably about when you dozed off in the Command Room.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;ll come back to you if you focus. That was, you know—</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We made it in time. Senpai, your number is... A single digit, in the front row.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Please take any available seat in the front row. Right in front of the Director, what a bad luck.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Let&#39;s cut the chit-chat. It&#39;s about to start.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Not quite on time, but it looks like everybody&#39;s here.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Welcome to Special Organization, Chaldea. I&#39;m the director, Olga Marie Animusphere.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> You have been selected, or discovered from each nation for your rare talents.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> By talent, I mean your aptitude for Spiritrons. People with magical circuits capable of becoming Masters.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> I&#39;m sure you can&#39;t even imagine it, but be sure to keep this in mind.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> You are about to be reborn as cutting-edge mages, in an unprecedented fusion of magecraft and science.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> That said, although all of you possess special talents, none of you are special.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Understand that you&#39;re all inexperienced rookies, standing at the same starting point.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> In particular, the mages sent from the Association still seem to be acting like students. Fix that immediately.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Chaldea is my domain. Family heritage and personal achievements have no meaning here.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Always remember that my orders are absolute. My position is completely different from yours.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> I won&#39;t allow arguments. You&#39;re all mere tools to protect humanity, nothing more.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> ...What&#39;s that commotion? Didn&#39;t I just tell you that I wouldn&#39;t allow any arguments?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> You there. The one who came in late. Do you have a problem with what I just said?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...Yawn.</p><hr><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Uh...Am I seeing this right? Maybe my eyes are playing tricks on me?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Sleeping while standing... No way, right? Not in a million years...</p><p><strong>New Hire (Female):</strong> Hey, I didn&#39;t sign up for this! We&#39;re experts who were summoned here because of our skills!</p><p><strong>New Hire (Female):</strong> We came all this way on your insistence. Absolute obedience? That&#39;s ridiculous!</p><p><strong>New Hire (Male):</strong> She&#39;s right, you&#39;re way overstepping!</p><p><strong>New Hire (Male):</strong> Lineage is the most important asset for a mage! How can you brush it off?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Quiet! No talking! That&#39;s why I say you&#39;re still acting like students!</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> I&#39;m only telling you what&#39;s going on right now. If you don&#39;t like it, leave Chaldea at once!</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Not that there are flights to send you home.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Though if you&#39;re ready to trek down a snowy mountain 6,000 meters above sea level, that would be commendable.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Very good! Nobody&#39;s dropped out. Seriously, don&#39;t make me waste my time on such matters.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> I wish you&#39;d realize that&#39;s how dire our, no, humanity&#39;s situation is now.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Look. [♂ He /♀ She] is a good example. No argument, no opinion. Good and obedient.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> ...Now, then, back to the topic. Are you listening? Today is—</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Do you remember now, Senpai?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Vaguely, I guess.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...In a way.</p><hr><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Remembered...You weren&#39;t really listening after all, were you?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Honestly! Sit yourself down! How could you come to a Singularity not knowing the situation or your mission?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> I&#39;m going to have to explain it to you again. Listen up! We at Chaldea—</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Director, leave that for later. Enemies are incoming!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> All right! Good timing!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Let&#39;s go, Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Hey, come back here! Listen to what I have to say!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> ...Phew. Good work, Mash Kyrielight. Now I can pick up where I left off.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Resume...You mean there&#39;s more, Director?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Why, certainly! Fujimaru! Don&#39;t tell me you forgot already!</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> I&#39;m only half way through! In fact, it&#39;s the latter half that&#39;s important!</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Make yourself remember! Make...your...self...re...mem...ber!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Guess I have no choice.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...What a piece of work.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Now, now, don&#39;t be like that. Director&#39;s ramblings can be useful, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Why were you Master candidates summoned to Chaldea? This will explain that.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Listen up. Today of all days, we at Chaldea will achieve something that will be written in history.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> The science of learning. The invention of religion. The acquisition of navigation. The focus of communication. The voyage into space.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Our legacy will be on par with the &quot;Pioneers of the Stars. &quot; No, it will surpass them.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Rather than expanding civilization, we will be the hands of God protecting it.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Stabilizing human history, we will transform the future into a solid resolution.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> The principles of mankind— in other words, to ensure the continuation of humanity.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> That is Chaldea&#39;s, and now your only and absolute purpose.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Chaldea has achieved many results to date. The development of observation cyber daemon, Laplace.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> The Global Environment Model, Chaldeas. Completion of the Near-Future Observation Lens, Sheba.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> The Heroic Spirit Summoning System, Fate, and the launch of the Spiritron Calculation Engine, Trismegistus.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> With these technologies, we at Chaldea have observed humanity&#39;s progress one hundred years into the future.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> We do not predict the future, but observe it. Like many who observed celestial bodies, Chaldea has been observing the future.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Whatever it sees, our job has been to ensure that humanity will survive 100 years into the future.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Look up. That is Chaldea&#39;s proudest achievement—</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Created with advanced magical theories, the Global Environmental Model, our Chaldeas.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Planets have been defined as beings with souls. We copied them into this miniature Earth.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Because of the difference in scale, we are unable to read each single human mind.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> But whatever&#39;s on the surface, the city lights that can be seen on land, can be observed through Sheba.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Currently, it&#39;s been set to reflect the Earth one hundred years from now. Chaldeas may very well be the future of Earth itself.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> As long as the light of civilization shines within Chaldeas, we can guarantee humans will exist a century further.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> As long as there&#39;s light people will live in cities, and serve as proof of civilization&#39;s survival.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> But— Lev, could you normalize Sheba&#39;s polarization angle?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> This is the current state. Starting six months ago, Chaldeas changed color, and it&#39;s become difficult to observe the future.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> The light of civilization, our beacon till now, has become largely unobservable to us.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Hmph, the right response. Good to see you&#39;ve got some sense.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> That&#39;s right. The lack of light means that civilization has become extinct.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> This was considered highly classified, but you have the right to know.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Our observations indicate that the light of humanity is only visible up to the year 2018—</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> In other words, we&#39;ve observed, no, proved that humanity will become extinct in that year.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Obviously, this future is not possible. It cannot happen, and physically speaking, is impossible.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> There&#39;s neither an economic collapse nor some sudden seismic event. We can&#39;t explain how humanity would suddenly just disappear.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Over the past six months, we&#39;ve found the cause of this strange phenomenon—the disappearance of the future.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> If the reason is not in the present, then it is in the past.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Using Laplace and the Trismegistus, we&#39;ve reviewed all data for the past 2000 years.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> We tried to find something that didn&#39;t exist in history, or was on Earth until this point in time.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> As a result, we finally found something new. It&#39;s this—</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Spatial Singularity F, a city in the Japanese countryside in 2004.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> We discovered an &quot;unobservable zone&quot; that did not exist in history up to the year 2017.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Chaldea hypothesizes that this is the cause for humanity&#39;s extinction. We proposed the Rayshift experiment to the U. N. and received approval.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> The Rayshift process transforms a human into spiritrons, sending them into the past and allowing them to alter it.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Simply put, it&#39;s time travel. But not everyone can do it.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Only people with exceptional magical circuits, and the ability to become a Master, can be transformed.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Now— I&#39;m sure that cleared things up. Your task is the investigation of Singularity F.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> You&#39;ll travel 14 years into the past, find Singularity F, and destroy it.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> We are now entering unknown territory. There&#39;s no telling what you might find there.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> But you&#39;ve been selected from among people all over the world. You can do this, and we have high expectations for you.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> The higher-ups want to know the cause of this immediately. We don&#39;t have time to waste.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> We&#39;ll be performing the first Rayshift experiment in an hour. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve all had enough training.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> For the first experiment we&#39;ll send Team A, the top 8 scorers, to Singularity F.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> I haven&#39;t told the later groups, but they&#39;re Master candidates who have been chosen from Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Team A has been active for a month now. You can call them trained warriors.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Team A will go on ahead and establish a base camp at Singularity F, guaranteeing your safety.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Teams B and below will monitor their situation and prepare for the next experiment.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Let&#39;s register your information with the Klein Coffins, the arks that will send you to the past as spiritrons.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> There&#39;s one for each person, and there are no spares. Be very careful with them.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Teams B through D will be on standby, in case of trouble with Team A.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> —What are you doing? I told you what you have to do.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> You were brought here as a potential Master. You&#39;re practically a soldier now.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> You will obey orders and be ready for a fight. Do not make me repeat myself.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Or do you have more questions? Hey you, the one who was late!</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> You look confused. I&#39;ll give you the chance to ask one question.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Is time travel possible?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Is it safe to change the past?</p><hr><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> ... Does the word &quot;Singularity&quot; mean nothing to you?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> The singularity we found doesn&#39;t exist in any of our observation records.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> It&#39;s like a hole that just appeared out of nowhere. The hole itself is cut off from the proper temporal axis.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> The 2004 singularity exists apart from the past and future. There&#39;s no need to connect it to our present.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> It&#39;s more stable than regular time travel, and whatever happens the timeline can still repair itself.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Singularity F is like a tiny stain on the dress that is human history.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> It ruins beauty just by its presence. Your job is to extract it.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> That&#39;s what will return humanity to its proper, observed course of history.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> ...What is the Association thinking, sending me someone who doesn&#39;t know basic spacetime theory?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> I told them this plan was a Grand Order, the highest possible duty in the world of magecraft...</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Well, it doesn&#39;t matter. What team are you with? ...Show me your ID.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> What? You&#39;re in the wrong spot! A civilian, and with no combat or training experience?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Chaldea is much too important to be wasting valuable slots on people like you!</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Lev! Lev Lainur!</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> I&#39;m right here, Director. Why the yelling? Is there a problem?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> There&#39;re problems everywhere! Just get this amateur out of my sight!</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Oh...so that&#39;s it? Director, [♂ he /♀ she] is a chosen Master candidate.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Sure they lack experience, but it&#39;s inappropriate to be that rude...</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Having an inexperienced amateur here is a problem! What if something happens to my Chaldeas?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Let Romani handle this! At least get some basic training in!</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> ...Hmm, I don&#39;t think she likes you. All right, orders are orders.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Mash, show Fujimaru their room.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> All right, understood. I just need to take Senpai to their room, right?</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Yes, thanks. I&#39;m busy with the Rayshift experiment and can&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Don&#39;t worry. This experiment will be over in 2 hours. I&#39;ll drop by your room then.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Thank you.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> No need to thank me. You&#39;re really lucky, after all.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s unusually kind of you, Dr. Lev. Do you know each other from somewhere?</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Not at all. I was just thinking things like eternal rivals and fated encounters are very important.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Come this way. I&#39;ll show you to your room.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> And that&#39;s how you were removed from the Command Room. Remember?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I see.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Got it.</p><hr><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> You little... You look quiet, but you&#39;ve got some nerve, don&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Anyway! Do you finally remember how much of a mess you made at that critical moment?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Um, Director Marie? I think that&#39;s going a little too far...</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Like hell it is! Thanks to the time I wasted on your question I didn&#39;t have time to change!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Uh...You weren&#39;t planning to dive, so I&#39;m not sure you needed your suit...</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> I did! I most certainly did! I had a special Mystic Code made for this mission.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Jeez, I didn&#39;t even get to wear it once... Well, it doesn&#39;t matter.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Anyway, you understand your responsibilities and duties as a Master candidate now, right?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Very well, Fujimaru. I&#39;m ordering you to be my bodyguard. Work hard.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Aye-aye, oh great Director Marie!</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> W-What? That&#39;s creepy. F-Flattery will get you nowhere!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...Are you trying to be someone you&#39;re not?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> This is who I am! I was just in a hurry back there! Once we get back to Chaldea, you&#39;re in for it.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Good to see you two getting along. Let&#39;s move before more enemies show up.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> By the way, the type of being we call Servants, you know what they are, don&#39;t you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I have no idea.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Just as I thought. It can&#39;t be helped. I&#39;ll tell you as we move.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Think of a Servant as the highest-ranked familiar in the magical world.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Various historical heroes. Noble acts. Concepts. They&#39;re all summoned as spiritual bodies.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Whether or not a hero truly existed, he or she is still &quot;information that was produced on Earth,&quot; right?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> To summon a Heroic Spirit is to convert the information stored on this planet into something for the good of mankind.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> People today have the right to use legacies of the past, and with that right, the duty to leave behind a future.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Do you see? What you made your contract with is greater than a human, and yet is a tool to serve humans.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> That&#39;s why they&#39;re called Servants. Even if they&#39;re gods, they exist only to serve their Masters.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Director. Your line of thinking may be extreme. My cells are not agreeing with what you just said.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Hmph. Meaning the Servant you fused with must be an Earth-type Heroic Spirit.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I do have some basic knowledge.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Glad to hear it. Now I won&#39;t have to explain rudimentary things like what a Heroic Spirit is.</p><hr><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Servants are heroes of the past made into familiars. Those who enter into a contract with them and use them are Masters.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> There are seven classes of Servants, which vary depending on a Servant&#39;s legends and abilities.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> It&#39;s incredibly difficult to copy a Heroic Spirit entirely. Human mages do not have enough resources or memory to achieve such feat.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> That&#39;s why only one aspect of a Heroic Spirit is fixed in our world, resulting in the seven classes—</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Saber, Lancer, Archer, Rider, Caster, Berserker, Assassin.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Every Heroic Spirit will manifest as one of these classes.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> That&#39;s the true nature of Servants... It&#39;s also a way to hide their True Names, as well.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> They hide their names because they are famous. Take Achilles from Greek Mythology.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Achilles is an invincible Heroic Spirit, but his weakness is extremely famous, right?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> When a Heroic Spirit returns, their weakness returns with them. That&#39;s why Servants hide their names behind their class names.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> If you don&#39;t know their identity, it&#39;s harder to figure out their past or weaknesses, right?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> That&#39;s not all. There&#39;s another reason for hiding one&#39;s True Name.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> A Servant has a secret weapon worthy of their legend. The crystallization of that Heroic Spirit&#39;s miracle and existence.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Director, sorry to interrupt you while you&#39;re having fun but we&#39;ve detected hostiles. Entering combat.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> What! T-Take them out right now! I-I&#39;ll be hiding over here!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> —</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I can feel the tension across the screen... The Director is grumpy as usual.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> She&#39;s not just grumpy, she&#39;s a total crank.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Why is she always so mad?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Well, I can feel some sympathy for the Director&#39;s ill temper.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Excuse me, but Fujimaru Senpai, there&#39;s too much about Chaldea you don&#39;t know.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Y-You really think so?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Well, I admit I came here clueless...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I really don&#39;t know what to do with you. It&#39;s like you&#39;re a lost little kitty.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> —Well, not that I&#39;m any different.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s been about two years since I started here, and I still don&#39;t get it. I kind of sneaked in. Almost like an alligator.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I-Is that right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> True, alligators have no clue.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, I&#39;ve learned as much as I can from the database. But I&#39;ll share it with you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Chaldea Security Organization. Or more accurately, the Security Organization for the Preservation of Humanity, Fenis Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A research observatory with the purpose of continuing and strengthening human history, with researchers, scholars, and mages from all around the world.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> They watch a world that magecraft couldn&#39;t observe, and science couldn&#39;t measure.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We&#39;re a special organization with national support, created to prevent humanity from reaching a &quot;bad end. &quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You sure know a lot, Mash.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Yeah, I figured.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Anyway, that&#39;s pretty much it.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s true that Chaldea receives financial support from across the globe, but the majority of that comes from the Mage&#39;s Association in London—</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> From the the Animusphere family. Director Olga Marie&#39;s family.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Chaldea is a research organization, but due to its importance, it operates on a military level.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> There are extremely strict rules and punishments for everything, so the Director&#39;s attitude is actually reserved.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The Director isn&#39;t a villain, but she is evil. She&#39;ll get rid of any staff member she doesn&#39;t like.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Well, I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s okay to call someone who&#39;s got a bad attitude, evil.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Sorry, I wanted to give you some encouragement, but I&#39;m not used to cheery words.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Kyu. Kyu, kyu!</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Whaaaaaaat? Hey! What are you guys doing?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Behind you! Behind you! The e-enemy&#39;s found us!</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Prepare for battle!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> They&#39;re so close! Senpai, give me your orders!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Sigh...Please keep an eye on your surroundings.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Even if Romani is monitoring us, this is a Singularity. There&#39;s no telling what might happen.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Come here, Kyrielight. You&#39;re hurt, aren&#39;t you? I can heal something like that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh...right. Thank you very much, Director Olga Marie.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Really, now. When the director is calm, she can be dependable...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Fujimaru, you should know... The director is in a complicated position as well.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Initially, Marie was like you all, a Master candidate.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Three years ago, the previous director, her father, passed away and she had to take over Chaldea when she was just a student.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Since then it&#39;s been one tense day after another. She had to take over as head of the Animusphere family.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It was all she could do to keep Chaldea running. Around that time, an anomaly was found in Chaldeas.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> We could no longer see into the promised future of 100 years from now. There was huge criticism from the Association and our sponsors.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> She was ordered to get the situation back to normal as soon as possible.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> To make matters worse, they found that she had no aptitude to be a Master.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The noble Animusphere family, one of the Twelve Lords, the dominating faculty of Astronomy at the Mage&#39;s Association.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Oh the scandal that would occur if the head of such a family was found to be unfit to become a Master.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> You can imagine the level of gossip happening behind the scenes. I&#39;m sure those rumors reached Marie too.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> She still worked to be her absolute best as Director. This last half-year, she&#39;s just barely been hanging on.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> She&#39;s worked herself so hard, I&#39;d like her to come for counseling, but with how things are...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> In any event, she&#39;s been emotionally stretched to the limit. She doesn&#39;t hate you, or anything like that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I know. Director Marie isn&#39;t an evil person.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;m glad you think so. But you know she is evil, right?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> She isn&#39;t cruel, nefarious, and dishonest, that I can promise you. She&#39;s just a rather serious person.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I was just having fun.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Hey, that&#39;s not nice! But I understand how you feel.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The Director wasn&#39;t allowed to go out much growing up, so everything she says is honest and innocent...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> But make sure you don&#39;t say that in front of her. She&#39;ll just hate you more.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Anyhow, you&#39;re the only three I can trust right now. I want you to continue investigating without fighting.</p><h2 id="section-4-investigate-the-port-ruin" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4-investigate-the-port-ruin" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 4: Investigate the Port Ruin</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The hostile lifeform has been removed. Let&#39;s move on.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> I didn&#39;t know what would happen with that monster, but I expected nothing less of a Servant&#39;s body. Such power.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Not that it makes them look any less scary... By the way Director, I have a question for you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The Fuyuki in our data, and this Fuyuki are just too different.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What happened in this city, exactly? What are your thoughts, Director?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Let&#39;s see, history must&#39;ve been slightly disrupted. That&#39;s the only reason I can think of.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Mash, Fujimaru. I&#39;m only going to say this once, so listen up.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Chaldea observes the future through an Earth model called Chaldeas. At the same time, a familiar called Laplace compiles past records.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> You can say it is Laplace&#39;s job to gather data on history that wasn&#39;t made public, and information that was buried in darkness that no one knows.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> According to Laplace&#39;s observations, an unusual Holy Grail War was confirmed in this city in 2004.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Holy Grail War? You mean the Holy Grail from the legend?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The magical chalice that is the root of all magecraft, the one that is said to grant its holder&#39;s wishes?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Yes, that&#39;s the one.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Mages in Fuyuki City competed for the Grail, and in order to activate it summoned seven Heroic Spirits—</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> That was the beginning of the Holy Grail War. Unknown to anyone, Servants were summoned to this town.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> The Fuyuki Holy Grail War system is simple.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Seven Masters fight each other. The last one standing gets the Grail.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Chaldea learned about this in 2010. My father... I mean, the previous director used this data to build the summoning system.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> That&#39;s what makes up Chaldea&#39;s Heroic Spirit Summoning System, Fate. Our third invention after Laplace and Chaldeas.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Third? Isn&#39;t that the Near-Future Observation Lens, Sheba?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> That was created by Professor Lev. Well, I guess you can say we both worked on it.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Anyway, this is where Servants come from.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Seven Servants fought here, and in the end, Saber was victorious.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> The town wasn&#39;t destroyed, and the Servants shouldn&#39;t have been noticed by anyone, but...</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Now this is happening. We should assume that the outcome changed due to this Singularity.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> The anomaly in 2004 brought about an alteration to human history and as a result, we&#39;re no longer able to see 100 years into the future.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> That&#39;s why it&#39;s our job to repair this anomaly. Somewhere here is the reason history has been disturbed.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Once we analyze and eliminate it, that will complete our mission. All of us will be able to return to the present.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I see. Got it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Anyway, although we&#39;re not sure what&#39;s going on, it&#39;s good that the mission is simple.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Heroic Spirits were summoned at Chaldea?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Of course. But it didn&#39;t go well, and there weren&#39;t many successes.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> According to the data, three were summoned, but I only know of two.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> The previous director summoned the first. The second and third arrived after I became Director.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> ...The second fused with Mash. And, well, you know the third.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> The weirdo that now lives in Chaldea. Leonardo da Vinci.</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong> GuOOOOOOO!!!!!!</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Not these guys again! Get rid of them, Mash, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Phew, the battle is over Master. I&#39;m relieved that we pulled through again.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Good work, Mash.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Thank you, Mash.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Yes. I am happy that I can be useful.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> ...Hey, Mash. Is it possible that you can&#39;t use your Noble Phantasm?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Apparently. I don&#39;t even know which Heroic Spirit fused with me...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...and I&#39;m unable to use the power of its Special Arts, the Heroic Spirit&#39;s secret weapon—known as a Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Fujimaru Senpai. I&#39;m sorry for explaining this so late.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Servants are equipped with a unique skill called a Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s derived from each hero&#39;s legend and great deeds, and is a secret weapon.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> However, I am unable to wield my Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I can somehow use it as a weapon, but its output is decreased. I can&#39;t even release its True Name.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> In fact, I don&#39;t even know what the origins of this weapon of mine might be.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> In any case, you can think of me as a failed Servant. Or maybe just a capable kouhai that can get even stronger.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I don&#39;t have any leads on the Heroic Spirit that fused with me, but with you as my Master I will figure it out as I grow.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> That&#39;s true. Masters have the ability to analyze their Servants parameters, skills, and matrixes.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Fujimaru...As a Master, once you become good enough, you should be able to analyze Mash&#39;s Servant data.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Any Servants you make a contract with from this point should be the same. First, you need to learn their True Name and Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> As your trust with them grows, your Servant&#39;s power will grow too.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Well, it&#39;s not like you have that much potential in you. The fact that you can&#39;t use Mash that well shows that.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Once we get Chaldea&#39;s Rayshift capability back online, we&#39;re going to shift a first-class Master here.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Then you&#39;re fired. Newbies with no combat experience can spend their time terrified in some corner in Chaldea.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Weren&#39;t you the one scared, Director Marie?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> I wasn&#39;t! Not in the least! You should be respectful to your elders!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Could it be that you&#39;re worried about me?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> O-Of course! You&#39;re our only fighting force here! If you get taken out, who&#39;s going to fight?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Anyway, I&#39;m glad you two understand each other better now. Let&#39;s move before any more of them show up.</p><h2 id="section-5-investigate-the-church-ruin" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-5-investigate-the-church-ruin" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 5: Investigate the Church Ruin</h2><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Everything&#39;s burnt down far as the eye can see... There aren&#39;t any traces of residents either. What happened here?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> What could even turn Chaldea gray in the first place? If we can&#39;t see the future, that means humanity will vanish...</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Could that mean the Counter Force doesn&#39;t work in a Singularity? Then this place is like a Bolt...</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> The fatal choice of destruction scattered throughout human history...When your choices become mistakes, this is what happens.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Looks like the Director is talking to herself again. This could take a while.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Hey Fujimaru, looks like it&#39;s safe over there. Why don&#39;t you rest a bit?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I agree with you, Doctor. Senpai, would you like some rations?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Thanks. Aren&#39;t you tired, Mash?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Sure, but how are you, Mash?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Tired? Are you asking if I&#39;ve been having any problems since I became a Servant?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Well, for the most part. It&#39;s scary to fight, but I&#39;m doing fine otherwise.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Are you okay with me being your Master?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Of course. I think you might&#39;ve been the best Master this summer.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Any complaints since you&#39;ve become a Servant?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s hard to explain. Imagine yourself becoming a jet fighter.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You might be able to fly around in the sky, but you can&#39;t do your own maintenance.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No matter how strong you might be, your existence essentially depends on having a Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...The risk and reward makes sense here. But I can&#39;t be too happy when I think of the burden I&#39;m putting on you.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> —! That&#39;s enough rest! We got incoming!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Master, your commands, please!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Phew! Thank goodness, we managed it yet again Master.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> I see you&#39;re getting used to being a Servant.

No matter how good I am with my weapon, when it comes to the battle itself...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Sorry, let&#39;s talk later!

No, you don&#39;t have a sword.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> ...Hey Fujimaru, what did you think of that?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Without a doubt, he&#39;s an old pervert.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...He&#39;s an ally, maybe?</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> For now, let&#39;s get some information. He seems to be a decent Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> Oh, so someone who wants to cut to the chase. What is this? Some means of communication through magecraft?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Well met, Caster Servant. I don&#39;t know which Heroic Spirit you are, but we have nothing but respect and awe for you.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> Oh, spare me your remarks. I&#39;m sick of hearing them. State your business, weakling. Isn&#39;t that what you&#39;re good at?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Uh...I-I see. All right then...Weakling...I got called a weakling from someone I&#39;ve met for the first time.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...And that&#39;s the current situation in Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Currently, Fujimaru is the acting Master and in the middle of conducting field research.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Let me confirm something. You&#39;re a Servant from the Holy Grail War that broke out in this city, and the sole survivor?</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> If by that you mean I haven&#39;t lost. Our Holy Grail War changed to something else entirely along the way.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> I don&#39;t know how it happened either. The city was engulfed in flames, and the humans vanished. Only the Servants remained.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> Saber was the first to resume the Holy Grail War. That chap began rampaging like a tiger released from a cage.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> Archer, Lancer, Rider, Berserker, and Assassin were all defeated by Saber.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> The survival of the Seven Servants... That rule of the Holy Grail War was broken here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> And in the end you won, Caster... Or rather, you&#39;re the Servant who survived.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> Yes. Any Servant that was defeated by Saber became like those two, corrupted by the black mud.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> They, and the monsters that sprung up like maggots, started looking for something together.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> The troublesome part is that I&#39;m one of the things they&#39;re looking for. You see, the Holy Grail War won&#39;t end until I&#39;m killed.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> You and Saber are the only surviving Servants... Then if you defeat Saber...</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> Yes, that would probably end the Holy Grail War here. But I don&#39;t know whether things would return to normal.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> I see. You helped us, but in the end, it was for your own sake, huh?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> You want to defeat Saber, but don&#39;t stand a chance doing it alone. That&#39;s why you zeroed in on us...Right?</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> That&#39;s right. But it&#39;s not a bad deal, is it? At any rate—It looks like we&#39;ve got company.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> GuOOOOOOOOO!</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Yikes!</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> There&#39;s no end to these guys. I&#39;m telling you, there&#39;s nothing better than having allies!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Sigh...Things have settled down at last. True, we can&#39;t have a decent conversation like this.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> My bad. If I&#39;d been summoned as a Lancer, I could&#39;ve finished off Saber with just one strike.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> Man, Caster is just not for me. I don&#39;t like being a Caster in a Holy Grail War like this.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> If you were a Lancer?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Is it hard being a Caster?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s been known to happen, Senpai. Some Heroic Spirits have the attributes of multiple classes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> He is not just a spear-wielder, but a high-level Heroic Spirit with qualifications to be a mage.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I&#39;m only speculating, but he must be one of the top Servants. The kind that&#39;s featured in the magazine Vivian.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> Ahh yes, you said you were Masters of an organization called Chaldea...I guess that&#39;s all I need to know.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> In general, Servants tend not to get overly involved in problems outside of their own time period. We ultimately only cooperate as weapons.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> Your goal is to investigate this anomaly. My goal is to put an end to the Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> We share mutual interests. So how about we join forces?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> ...That is a rational proposition. But if we do that, who will be your Master?</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> Well that [♂ kid /♀ young lady] there, of course. It doesn&#39;t seem like you have the aptitude to be a Master.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> I mean you possess high quality magical circuits, yet you don&#39;t have the aptitude to be a Master. Is it a curse?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Oh, shut up! What do you care?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Fujimaru, he&#39;s in your hands. Use him wisely.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> Then it&#39;s settled. The contract is only temporary, but I&#39;m counting on ya.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> That leaves one last thing, your goal. What you&#39;re looking for is probably the Greater Grail.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Greater Grail? I&#39;m not familiar with that. What is it?</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> This land&#39;s true &quot;heart. &quot; If there is indeed a &quot;Singularity,&quot; it has to be that.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> But Saber is lingering around the Greater Grail. The remaining Servants she contaminated, too.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Berserker and Archer are the ones left? What are those two like? Are they strong?</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> Well, Archer can be dealt with if I&#39;m with you. Berserker is the problem.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> Even Saber had trouble with that monster. But he won&#39;t attack unless you get close to him, so ignoring him is one option.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> We understand the situation now. We&#39;ll team up with Mr. Caster to obtain the Greater Grail.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Mr. Caster, would you show us the way?</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> Skip the &quot;Mister. &quot; I&#39;ll take you there. The [♂ kid /♀ young lady] here will decide when to make our move.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Much obliged. Then shall we resume the search? I&#39;m counting on you, Fujimaru.</p><h2 id="section-7-toward-the-greater-grail" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-7-toward-the-greater-grail" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 7: Toward the Greater Grail</h2><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><h2 id="section-8-mash-s-training" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-8-mash-s-training" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 8: Mash&#39;s Training</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Hey, Fujimaru. It&#39;s pretty obvious that Kyrielight&#39;s looking depressed.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> You are her Master, aren&#39;t you? Do something to cheer her up!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Mash, is something wrong?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No! There&#39;s nothing different. I&#39;m operating perfectly, Master!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But that&#39;s the problem, nothing&#39;s different...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Could it be...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. I&#39;m ashamed to be the one to say this, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um, under your command Senpai, I have gained enough experience...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> And yet...I&#39;m still unable to unleash my Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I don&#39;t even know how to unleash it... I&#39;m like a defective Servant.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Oh, so that&#39;s what was bothering you. You have such a strong sense of responsibility, Mash...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> But I don&#39;t think that can be settled overnight. After all, it&#39;s a Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> If a Heroic Spirit&#39;s secret weapon can be mastered within a day or two, then Servants wouldn&#39;t be that special anymore.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> Of course we can master something like that immediately. After all, Heroic Spirits and Noble Phantasms are the same thing.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> If the young lady here can fight as a Servant, that means at that very moment you can use your Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> And yet you can&#39;t, which simply means your magical energy is not circulating right.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> Let&#39;s see, maybe enthusiasm? No, perhaps too reserved? Anyway, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s because you just don&#39;t yell out when you practice.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Really? R-E-A-L-L-Y-!?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Faaaaaaaaaaa?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Hey, don&#39;t yell all of a sudden! You&#39;re going to burst my eardrums, seriously!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Sorry Director. But Caster said we should shout...</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> No, that was a metaphor... Well, at any rate, I see you have enthusiasm.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> Fujimaru, you heard the young lady. Do you mind if we take a quick detour?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Detour? What kind?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Don&#39;t tease Mash. She&#39;s an innocent girl.</p><hr><p><strong>Caster:</strong> What? I&#39;m just talking about special training. It won&#39;t take long. I&#39;m a Caster right now, so leave the healing to me.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> First we&#39;ll start off small. Let me inscribe some misfortune-bringing runes...Okay, we&#39;re done.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Huh? What are you doing? Why are you inscribing runes on my coat?</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> Even if something targets you, you can take care of yourself, right? And look, here they come.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Grrrrrr... Zuaaaaaaaa!</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> D-Director, get behind me! You too Senpai, prepare for battle!</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> All right, that should be enough.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> To put it simply, a Noble Phantasm is part of a Heroic Spirit&#39;s instinct. It&#39;s hard to use it if you think too much.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> Therefore, you must first use up all of your energy, young lady! Man, I&#39;m a genius!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That isn&#39;t a cure, that&#39;s an extreme measure!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Maybe you&#39;re an idiot?</p><hr><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I can&#39;t, go on— Any more back-to-back, battles— I&#39;m sorry, Caster—</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Rather than test my will, please teach me some solid theories—</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> —You just don&#39;t get it, do you? Did I miscalculate?</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> Oh well, let&#39;s cross that bridge when we get to it. Okay, I&#39;m your next opponent.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> You don&#39;t have to hold back because we&#39;re allies. I&#39;m not gonna hold back when I kill Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Wh-!</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> What are you talking about? Are you crazy? What does Fujimaru have to do with this?</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> A Servant&#39;s problems are the Master&#39;s problems. Didn&#39;t I mention that you share the same fate?</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> You&#39;ve had the same thought, right Fujimaru? When the young lady can&#39;t stand anymore, it&#39;s your death.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Master, please, stand back!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I—won&#39;t be a hindrance for Senpai... I won&#39;t!</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> That&#39;s what I like to hear. All right, let&#39;s have a real Servant battle.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (Pant)—(Pant)—(Pant)—</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> Ok, it&#39;s time to finish this. Burn to the ground with your Master!</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> My spell is the coffin of flames, a giant of verdant thorn. Retribution, the forest that will purify human misery—</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> Befall the Wicker Man! And behold, as both good and evil bite the dust—!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ah—Ah...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (I must protect...I must unleash it, or everyone will— Even if it&#39;s fake, even if it&#39;s just for now...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I have to unleash it properly, or everyone will disappear—! )</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ahhhhhhhh—!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh...I... Did I, manage to unleash my Noble...Phantasm...</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> —Whew, I knew you&#39;d survive that. But I never thought both you and your Master would walk out without a scratch.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> Be happy, wait no... Praise her, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> That young lady there is without question, a first-rate Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai, I...just now!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Right. Congratulations, Mash.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Yeah. That was amazing, Mash.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> !!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fooooouuuu!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> That was surprising. I didn&#39;t expect her to unleash her Noble Phantasm that soon. Mash was never someone with a strong will...</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> That&#39;s because you got her all wrong. You may call the young lady here, a protector.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> There&#39;s no point in teaching a bird to swim, is there? You have to teach a bird how to fly high.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> Although... She didn&#39;t get to obtain its True Name.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Right. Even though I can unleash my Noble Phantasm now, I still don&#39;t know its True Name, nor the True Name of the Heroic Spirit...</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> That&#39;s fine, even if you are inexperienced... Even if you are only temporary...</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Your very wish unleashed your Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> You didn&#39;t have the slightest desire to obtain a True Name, to become one of the chosen— To become a true Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> That&#39;s why your Noble Phantasm responded. Ahhh, what an inspiring story. Just like a fairy tale.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um, Director...</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Don&#39;t mind me, I&#39;m just teasing. I&#39;m pleased that you&#39;re able to use your Noble Phantasm now.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> But it&#39;s inconvenient to use it without a True Name, right? I&#39;ll think of a good spell for you.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Since it&#39;s a pseudo-deployment of Noble Phantasm... Let me see...Yes, let&#39;s call it &quot;Lord Chaldeas. &quot;</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Chaldea is a name that has meaning for you too. So to activate your Spirit Origin, that&#39;s a good spell for you, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Y-Yes... Thank you, Director!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Lord Chaldeas...Yes, I like it. That fits you perfectly, Mash!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> And the desire to try it out after getting it is only human nature. Caster, would you be Mash&#39;s sparring partner?</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> Yes, of course. I was holding back before, but even so, her defense was impeccable.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> As someone with more experience, I&#39;ll hammer the basics of Noble Phantasms into your head. Fujimaru, young lady, are you ready?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, please!</p><h2 id="section-9-the-dark-cave" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-9-the-dark-cave" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 9: The Dark Cave</h2><p><strong>Caster:</strong> The Greater Grail is back here. It&#39;s a little far back, so don&#39;t get lost.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This place looks like a natural cave... Did this always exist in Fuyuki City?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Probably, it&#39;s half natural, half man-made. It&#39;s the underground workshop expanded by mages over a number of years.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Anyway, Caster. I forgot to ask you something important.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Do you know Saber&#39;s True Name? It sounded like you&#39;d fought several times.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> Yes, I know it. Anyone who gets hit by Saber&#39;s Noble Phantasm will find out that bastard&#39;s True Name...</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> The other Servants were all defeated because Saber&#39;s Noble Phantasm was that powerful.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A powerful Noble Phantasm, is it? What was it like?</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> The sister sword of the Sword in the Stone. It&#39;s the most famous sacred sword in your time period.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> Its name...</p><p><strong>Servant:</strong> The Sword of Promised Victory, Excalibur. Wielded by King Arthur, the proud King of Knights.</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong> !?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Archer!</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> Ah, speak of the devil. Or shall I say, the faithful follower. As always, I see that you&#39;re still the loyal knight.</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> ...Hmph, I don&#39;t remember becoming a follower of anybody. I&#39;m just here to chase away unwanted visitors.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> In other words, you&#39;re the gatekeeper. I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re protecting Saber, but let&#39;s end this here.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> Isn&#39;t a game that never ends boring? For better or worse, we need to move the pieces forward.</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> From the way you talk, I think you understand the circumstances. Yet you are still absorbed by your own desires...</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> You still haven&#39;t changed despite being a mage now. In that case, I will knock some sense into you.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> Ha, big talk for a mere Archer. Hey, why are you just standing there, young lady?</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> He&#39;s an Archer. Without your shield, I won&#39;t have the time to cast my spells.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ah...R-Right! Sorry, I was out of it for a second there.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But no problem, I can do this. When it comes to guarding, leave it to me!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> Well done, Mage of Flowers! Who knew her Noble Phantasm could be utilized that way!</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> Hey, it&#39;s time for you to take a hike! The young lady and I will take down the Sacred Sword!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I&#39;m glad that you trust me, but do you think I can guard against it?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I&#39;ve heard about the Sword of King Arthur. My fingers are trembling, it seems too much for me...</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> Well, you&#39;ll just have to overcome it with courage. But from where I stand, you seem to be perfect for the job.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> That shield will never shatter, if you were to lose, it would be because the young lady messed it up.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> If you let go of that shield, your Master behind it will evaporate instantly.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> Listen, don&#39;t think about beating the Sword. All you need to think about is protecting your Master.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> That&#39;s right up your alley, no?</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> Well, anyway. Leave it to me to finish off Saber, and just do what you need to do.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Right.

This will be our last break. Is there anything you&#39;ve left undone?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> No, I&#39;m ready.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> That&#39;s good to hear. I dislike Masters who can&#39;t make up their minds when push comes to shove.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> You&#39;re still a rookie, but you&#39;ve got the most important thing a pioneer can have.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> The divine luck to grasp fate, and the ability to make decisions.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> Don&#39;t forget how to be reckless. People like that are the ones who&#39;ll get blessed by the stars.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Can we go back to the base first?</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> If it&#39;s necessary, then by all means go back.

Ah...Yeah, this doesn&#39;t look very good. It&#39;s because of the unexpected Servant contract...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> You never used your magic circuits and now they&#39;re running at full capacity. It&#39;s probably putting stress on your brain.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Mash, set up camp. It&#39;s time to make warm tea with plenty of honey.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Got it, Doctor. I think tea time is a good idea.</p><p><strong>Caster:</strong> Oh, feeding yourselves before the final battle? Then maybe I&#39;ll go hunting for some wild boars.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> I&#39;m sure there aren&#39;t any around here. Besides, forget about meat, if you must get something make it fruit.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I&#39;m stuffed. I can&#39;t believe you had dried fruits with you, Director. Again, your level of preparation astonishes me.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> I just happened to have them. Citrus is effective against headaches.

That&#39;s not what I wanted to...Oh, forget it!</p><hr><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Th-The work you&#39;ve done so far, has been passable.

I know that even a third-rater can do first-rate work.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Well, well, admitting that Fujimaru did a solid job. Have you eaten something sweet?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Romani. If you&#39;ve got time to be flapping your gums, use it to send Fujimaru a supply or two instead.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> I would feel bad if someone failed because they were ill-equipped. Especially, when they have been doing their best.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> What&#39;s this? &quot;Feel bad? &quot; How kind of you.

So, you survived as well.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> I told you to come to the command room immediately, but it seems you didn&#39;t listen. Honestly—</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Trash who can&#39;t even follow orders. Just the mere sight of it makes me want to throw up.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Why is it that humans always try to avoid their preordained destinies?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> —! Master, fall back! Fall back, please!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That person is dangerous...Th... That isn&#39;t the Professor Lev we know!</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Lev...Oh, Lev! Lev! You&#39;re alive!</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Thank goodness! Without you, I don&#39;t know how I could protect Chaldea!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Director don&#39;t! That man is...</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Hi, Olga. You seem well. Looks like you had a rough time, too.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Yes, yes, that&#39;s right, Lev! The command room blew up, the city&#39;s in ruins, and I can&#39;t return to Chaldea!</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> I&#39;m going crazy from all these unforeseen complications! But it&#39;s okay, as long as you&#39;re here we&#39;ll be fine, right?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> That&#39;s how it&#39;s always been, right? You&#39;ll help me this time too, won&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Yes, of course. Honestly, all these complications have irritated me.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> And the biggest complication is you, Olga. I set the bomb right under your feet, yet you still live.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> —What? ...L-Lev? Um, wh-what&#39;s that supposed to mean?</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Sorry, you&#39;re not actually alive. You&#39;re already dead. Your body, at least, long ago.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Trismegistus thoughtfully transferred you into this land after you&#39;d become residual thoughts.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> You had no aptitude for Rayshift while alive, right? You can&#39;t teleport while you have a physical body.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Understand? You only gained the aptitude you so desired after you died.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> That&#39;s why you can&#39;t return to Chaldea. The moment you do, your consciousness will vanish.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Wh-What? I&#39;ll vanish? Wait...I can&#39;t return to Chaldea?</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Indeed. But that&#39;s too sad of a story for you.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Let me show you the fate of the Chaldea that you devoted your entire life to.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Wh-What is that? Chaldeas is bright red?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> It&#39;s a lie, right? It&#39;s just an illusion, right, Lev?</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> It&#39;s real. I&#39;ve connected the dimensions for you. Having the Holy Grail allows me to do so.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Now behold, descendant of Animusphere. Behold your folly!</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Not a sliver of blue representing human survival remains. Nothing but a burning, bright, red.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> That is the outcome of this mission.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Isn&#39;t it wonderful, Marie? Once again, your incompetence has brought forth tragedy!</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Don&#39;t—Don&#39;t be absurd!</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> I&#39;m not responsible! I didn&#39;t fail! I&#39;m not dead!</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Who are you? What have you done to my Chaldeas!</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> It isn&#39;t &quot;yours. &quot; Honestly— What an annoying girl you are!</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Wha...Something&#39;s pulling— my body across space—</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> I told you. That place is now connected with Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> I could kill you now, but there&#39;s no grace to that. I will grant you your final wish, instead.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Go ahead and lay hands on your treasure. Think of it as benevolence on my part.</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Wait—What do you mean, Lev? My treasure...You mean Chaldeas?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> No, stop, please! Chaldeas? A high-density body of data? A territory of dimensional anomaly?</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Yes. No different from a black hole. Or perhaps a sun. Well, either way.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> A human touching it would be a hellish disintegration on the molecular level. By all means, have a taste of infinite living death!</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> No—No, no! Someone help me! Help! I...I don&#39;t want to die here!</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Because I&#39;ve never been praised... I&#39;ve never been praised by anyone!</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> Why? Why does this always happen to me!?</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> No one ever valued me! Everyone hated me!</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> No! Stop! No, no, no, no, no... I haven&#39;t even accomplished anything yet!</p><p><strong>Olga Marie:</strong> From the moment I was born, I&#39;ve never been accepted by anyone—!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Director!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...It&#39;s too late, we can&#39;t make it...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong> !!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No! Don&#39;t do it, Senpai! If you approach that man, you&#39;ll die the same way!</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Oh? Impressive, for a Demi-Servant. You sense that I am a fundamentally different life form.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Shall I reintroduce myself? My name is Lev Lainur Flauros...</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> ...In charge of the year 2017 sent to dispose of you humans.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Are you listening, Dr. Romani? As a friend who studied magecraft with you, let me give you some final advice.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Chaldea is finished. You humans have reached the moment of your destruction.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...Professor Lev. No. Lev Lainur.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> What do you mean? Is it related to being unable to see 2019?</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> It&#39;s not &quot;related. &quot; It&#39;s the reality that this is the end.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Unable to observe the future, you babbled that it had &quot;disappeared. &quot; That was truly wishful thinking.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> The future didn&#39;t disappear. It was incinerated. The moment Chaldeas was dyed crimson.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Your end is certain. Your era no longer exists.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Chaldeas&#39; magnetic field may be protecting Chaldea, but any outside of it will face the same fate as Fuyuki City.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...So, that was it.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> We didn&#39;t lose contact with the outside world due to interference, we simply lost the outside world itself.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Hmpf, you really are perceptive. A shame I didn&#39;t kill you immediately.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> But that too is futile resistance. If the time within Chaldea passes 2018 it will be wiped from this universe.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> No one can change the outcome now. This is a rejection of humanity by human history.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> You didn&#39;t perish because your inability to evolve, nor did you perish due to war with foreign species.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Rather, it was your own foolishness! Your incompetence! Because you lost the grace of our King!</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Like a bunch of worthless scrap paper, you&#39;ll be burned away without a trace!</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Ah, is this singularity at its limit?</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> ...Cursed Saber. If you&#39;d just obeyed, you would have been allowed to live.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Even when given the Holy Grail, she caused trouble by wanting to sustain this era.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Farewell, Romani. And you Mash, Candidate #48.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Believe it or not, I have other things to do. My enjoyment of your destruction ends here.</p><p><strong>Lev:</strong> Now, be swallowed by the dimensional warp. But I&#39;m not that evil, I&#39;ll allow you to say a final prayer.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The underground cavern&#39;s collapsing! No, the cavern wasn&#39;t stable in the first place!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Doctor! Perform an emergency Rayshift!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> At any rate, we can at least save Senpai!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Understood! I&#39;m already doing it! But I&#39;m sorry, it may collapse faster than I can fix it!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> If it does, then do what you can on your side! I mean, we can survive in space for a few dozen seconds, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Sorry, but please shut up, Doctor! I&#39;m so mad, I&#39;m about to lose my cool!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Just hang on to your consciousness! If we don&#39;t lose that, I might salvage—</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We won&#39;t make it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Mash, this way!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Mash, you at least...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai, your hand!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> All right, you&#39;re a good boy. Want something to eat? Nuts? Or maybe fish?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Hm, not sure if you are a cat or a squirrel. But that&#39;s okay, you are pretty cute!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou... Kyu, kyu...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Hm? Ah, the hero has awakened. There, there, that&#39;s how a main character should be.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Good morning Fujimaru. You&#39;re conscious now?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Where...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Who are you?</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong> Hm, you&#39;re not thinking straight yet? This is the first time we&#39;ve spoken directly like this.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> What? Are you shocked that you woke up to the sight of such a beauty? I understand, but I&#39;m used to it.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I&#39;m Da Vinci, a Chaldea collaborator. Or perhaps the third summoned Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Anyway, we&#39;ll talk later. Somebody&#39;s waiting for you, go to the command room.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Someone&#39;s waiting?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Is it the doctor?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Roman? Roman&#39;s waiting too, but he&#39;s not important.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Jeez, there&#39;s someone else, she&#39;s the important one. Guess you&#39;re not used to being the main character yet.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, Fou!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> See? This little one says so, too. Come on, time to get up Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> From here on, you&#39;ll be the center of this story. The choices you make will probably save us all.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Just like the multitudes of brave souls who weren&#39;t remembered by history as they saved humanity.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You&#39;ve been given a role to fight, not as a hero, but as a human walking a path that was preordained by the stars.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Good morning, Senpai. I am glad to see that you&#39;re okay.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Good morning. Thank you, Mash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I should be the one thanking you. I was able to stay conscious, thanks to you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Good morning. You were saved, Mash?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, thanks to you holding my hand. I now believe that saying &quot;what happens twice will happen thrice. &quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Ahem. I&#39;m all for your reunion, but could you bring your attention here, please.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> First of all, congratulations on surviving and completing your mission Fujimaru. Well done.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> While the situation was forced on you gradually, you bravely faced the challenges and overcame it.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> That earned my respect and appreciation. Thanks to you, Mash and Chaldea were saved.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It&#39;s a shame about the Director, but we&#39;ve no time to hold a service. All we can do is grieve.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> If I survived, then maybe the Director...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Listen. We must defend humanity in the Director&#39;s place. That&#39;s how we pay her tribute.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I got the report about the crystal from Mash, and what Lev said.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> From Chaldea&#39;s state, what Lev said was true. We can&#39;t contact the outside world.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The staff who left Chaldea haven&#39;t returned. I fear humanity has already been destroyed.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Chaldea seems to be the only place outside of the normal timeline. Perhaps it&#39;s staying on the timeline right before the collapse.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Think of it like a colony floating in space. The outside world is dead, until we do something about this situation.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Can we even do it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Is there something we can do?</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Of course. First, I want you to see this. We tried scanning Earth with the resurrected Sheba.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It&#39;s Earth of the past, not the future. The Fuyuki Singularity was destroyed, thanks to you.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> But we hypothesize that the future was unchanged due to another cause.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The result being—</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> This distorted world map. A newly-discovered dimensional disturbance against which Fuyuki pales in comparison.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> They say changing the past changes the future, but you can&#39;t overthrow the future by slightly altering the past.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> History has the power to heal itself. You might be able to save a person or two...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...But the end of that era— Will still end up with its definitive result unchanged.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> But these singularities are different. These are humanity&#39;s turning points.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> &quot;What if this war didn&#39;t end? &quot; &quot;What if this naval voyage wasn&#39;t successful? &quot;</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> &quot;What if this discovery was wrong? &quot; &quot;What if this nation couldn&#39;t become independent? &quot;</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The ultimate decision point to determine the current state of humanity.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Destroying them is like causing the foundation of human history to crumble. That&#39;s what these seven singularities are.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The future had already been decided when these seven singularities formed. As Lev said, humanity doesn&#39;t make it to 2019.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> —But, we&#39;re different. Chaldea has yet to reach that future.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Do you understand? Only we can fix this mistake. Now we have a chance to return the singularities to normal.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> So here&#39;s the deal.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Rayshift into these seven singularities and get history back on track.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It&#39;s the only way to save humanity. However we are still powerless.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> All other Master candidates are frozen. Mash is the only Servant we have.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I realize you&#39;re being forced into this situation. Even so, I&#39;ll still say it.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Master Candidate #48, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> If you wish to save humanity... If you wish to have a future beyond 2018.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Then you alone must go and face these seven singularities in human history.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Are you prepared to do this? Can you shoulder the burden of Chaldea and humanity&#39;s future?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Of course.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> If it&#39;s something I can do.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> —Thank you. With those words, our fate has been decided.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> We will now carry out the Prevervation of Humanity as laid out by Olga Marie Animusphere, former director of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Our objective is the protection and recovery of human history. Our search target will be each era&#39;s relic and Grail.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Our opponent is history itself. Many great Heroic Spirits and legends will stand against you.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Challenging them is an act of blasphemy against the past. To save humanity, we must defy human history.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> But this is the only way to survive. No, the only way to take back the future.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...No matter what sort of end awaits us.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> To reflect our determination, we shall abandon the original mission name, First Order.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> This is now Chaldea&#39;s last yet original mission. The Grand Order!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> In the name of the magical world&#39;s highest order. We will take back the future!</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div><footer class="page-meta"><div class="meta-item edit-link"><a class="external-link meta-item-label" href="https://github.com/r-grandorder/wiki/edit/main/src/Singularity/fuyuki.md" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" aria-label="Help us improve this page!"><!--[--><!--]--> Help us improve this page! <span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewbox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span><!--[--><!--]--></a></div><div class="meta-item last-updated"><span class="meta-item-label">Last Updated: </span><!----></div><div class="meta-item contributors"><span class="meta-item-label">Contributors: </span><span class="meta-item-info"><!--[--><!--[--><span class="contributor" title="email: 65916237+enshael@users.noreply.github.com">enshael</span><!----><!--]--><!--]--></span></div></footer><!----><!--[--><!--]--></main><!--]--></div><!----><!--]--></div>
