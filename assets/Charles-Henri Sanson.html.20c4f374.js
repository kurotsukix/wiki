Put &#39;em on the guillotine!</p><p><strong>Citizen:</strong> Be beheaded and know the evil you have done up to now!</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Citizen:</strong> Guillotine! Guillotine! Guillotine! Kill them! Kill them! Kill them!</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> ...Whoa. You seemed to be having a nightmare. What happened?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> The dream, just now...</p><hr><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> Maybe you dreamed about me? Really, I was just recalling the past now, too.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> ...My life is a repeat of what you saw. There are no regrets. None obviously.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> I mean, an executioner wielding a sword with regret would be something below a packhorse.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> I send criminals to heaven, without an instant of pain, to enable them to travel freely to their death.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> Executioners are the blades of the state at all times. It wouldn&#39;t work any other way.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> This is because the law can be bent at any time. If it declares a criminal innocent, that&#39;s fine too.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> They merely slipped through a loophole of the law. As long as nobody gives up, the criminal will still be punished someday.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> But\u2013the law punishes the innocent at times. This was especially prominent in the French Revolution.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Innocent people were killed?</p><hr><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> That&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> ...Their crime, if any, was being born.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> That child died simply because he served a man that should be executed.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> Considering that, though there still are loopholes, the fact that the act of punishing the innocent has became rare</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> should be something welcomed.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> ...Oh, sorry. I apparently disturbed your slumber.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> I pray that you have sweet dreams. Well, good night.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> Oh, is it Mash and Master? What happened?</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> ...That&#39;s right. It&#39;s definitely strange here. It looks like... France, but not the Paris I grew up in.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I can&#39;t specify the place. It appears that I can&#39;t communicate with the Doctor either.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We may have been flown off to another era during the Rayshift.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Let&#39;s ask what&#39;s going on in the city, first.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> There may be a Singularity, and we may be able to return if we fix that.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> Oh, you&#39;re here, too? ...Yeah, it&#39;s as you say, Mash.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> Let&#39;s move onward, Master. We just might find something.</p><p><strong>Citizen:</strong> H-Help...</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> Quiet! You&#39;re guilty! Proceed with the execution!</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> What&#39;d you say...You stop it. It&#39;s impossible to have an execution without a trial!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Sanson!?</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> Who&#39;re you? You, a townsman, dare to defy us!?</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> Gosh. These uneducated morons! I shall execute you, in the name of the King.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> ...What...!?</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> No need for excuses. We shall judge you!</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> ...Right. How lucky. You said excuses are useless, and there&#39;s no room for discussion, right?</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> &quot;Thanks for making this easy for me.&quot; I feel like my soul is defiled simply by talking to you.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> Permission to fight, Master. I&#39;ll ask these soldiers where the true crime lies.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> We&#39;re good. They are unable to fight for now. Let&#39;s free the citizens at once.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What if they&#39;re criminals?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What if they&#39;re guilty?</p><hr><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> ...Be that as it may, the law is the law. The area should be arranged for an execution, at least.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> Not believing their innocence while helping them... I must say I feel quite contradictory.</p><p><strong>Citizen:</strong> Ugh...!</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> So we&#39;re done with all executions, right?</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> Not yet. You still have this child.</p><p><strong>Child:</strong> Uuh...</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> \u2013That&#39;s enough.</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> ...Why do you stop us?</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> ...er! It&#39;s obvious, isn&#39;t it!</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> That&#39;s not the law or an execution! Just one-sided, unreasonable slaughter!</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> \u2013You were involved, too, weren&#39;t you? Charles-Henri Sanson.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> ...What...!?</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> Right. You&#39;re in no position to say that.</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> In the name of the King. In the name of the government.</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> How many men did you kill? How many men did you punish?</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> ...There were many innocent people among them, I bet.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> Stop...Stop!!</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> IT IS YOUR FAULT!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> (Panting...)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Sanson...</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> ...I know. I do know. I know that!</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> But, execution and murder are different! No, they have to be different!</p><p><strong>Sanson (?):</strong> \u2013Well, can you explain the difference?</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> ...Er!? Are you\u2013me?</p><p><strong>Sanson (?):</strong> Am I you?</p><p><strong>Sanson (?):</strong> You became a Servant. Do you kill somebody with your own free-will?</p><p><strong>Sanson (?):</strong> Or will you obey your Master\u2013conform to the law, and execute someone?</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> I am... I am...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Sanson won&#39;t murder anymore.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Sanson is an executioner.</p><hr><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> Master...</p><p><strong>Sanson (?):</strong> This man was once greatly confused in France, and murdered many men.</p><p><strong>Sanson (?):</strong> How can you say he won&#39;t follow the same path again?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> As long as I&#39;m the Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> ...Master...</p><p><strong>Sanson (?):</strong> If you&#39;re going to go that far, Master, I shall put that resolve to the test.</p><p><strong>Sanson (?):</strong> Whether or not &quot;Sanson&quot; can truly overcome it\u2013!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Sanson (?):</strong> ...Hmph. You&#39;re that determined, Master?</p><p><strong>Sanson (?):</strong> That&#39;s fine, then. Though I have yet to assess whether I can place my blade of trust with you\u2013</p><p><strong>Sanson (?):</strong> First, let&#39;s show you what I can do as an executioner.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> Hey there. Were you dreaming?</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> ...Probably. I was dreaming myself.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> ...Still no end to my worries. No, my agony haunts me even now, after death.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> Nevertheless, I offer my strength to you for believing in me then.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> Because that&#39;s all that I can do now\u2013</p>',108),a=[r];function i(g,p){return o(),t("div",null,a)}var l=n(s,[["render",i],["__file","Charles-Henri Sanson.html.vue"]]);export{l as default};
