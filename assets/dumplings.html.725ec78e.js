Why are you looking at me like that?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Mmm, it&#39;s like you&#39;re saying \u201CI, myself, don&#39;t know, but this must be a form of happiness.\u201D</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Your expression is like a mixture of spiritual insight, affection, and a little pity. Has something happened?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> No, but, Doctor finally...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> What, were you watching me?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> And what do you mean by \u201Cfinally?\u201D I didn&#39;t do anything!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Why are you walking around with an empty plate?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Yeah, that&#39;s the problem. I keep waiting and waiting, but Mash hasn&#39;t come back yet.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I asked her to grab something from storage for me, but I wonder if something happened...</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hey, Romani, where are the dumplings? I&#39;m about to show footage of the moon.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Let&#39;s hurry up and hit the booze. After all, we&#39;ve been holding out for this day.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...Hmph, yeah right. That&#39;s what you say, but you&#39;ve already started drinking like a fish, you lout...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Wait a little while longer, Da Vinci. Not all the staff members are here yet.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Alcohol?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Dumplings?</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Huh? Fujimaru, didn&#39;t you hear? The outdoor calendar shows it&#39;s almost the end of summer.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Meaning it&#39;s almost time for the Moon Festival. It&#39;s said the harvest moon shall liven up conversations between friends.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The date isn&#39;t exactly right, but as long as there&#39;s a beautiful full moon in the night sky, it&#39;s perfect for the Moon Festival.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> There&#39;s not a lot to do for fun in Chaldea, so I prepared this thinking we could use a break, but...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Mash hasn&#39;t come back yet. She was getting the dumplings from food storage.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> She said, \u201CI&#39;m powerful now that I&#39;ve become a Demi-Servant, so leave it to me.\u201D Then she took off on her own...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I have a bad feeling about this. Fujimaru, go see what&#39;s up\u2014</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The alarm? What&#39;s going on?!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This is serious, Doctor! Someone has raided our food storage!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> As well as the offerings we prepared for the festival and everything else... Chaldea&#39;s food reserves are nearly down to zero!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What?!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ah. Good morning. I&#39;m happy to see you&#39;re as healthy as ever.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Is this the place for that kind of conversation? I&#39;m impressed by how much you trust each other.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That aside, those glasses really look good on you, Mash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ah... Thank you. My eyes are good so I don&#39;t really need them, but...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Okay, look around you. This is supposed to be a tense scene.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> No, this is not the time to discuss that. Somebody raided our food storage. Who could it be?!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The thing is... None of the surveillance cameras picked up anything... They&#39;re not broken, but...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...but it&#39;s like all of the recorded footage has been painted over with a heart mark, so we can&#39;t see anything.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The analysis team in the monitor room said...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> \u201CWhen we watched the footage, we got dizzy and fell unconscious, one right after the other...\u201D</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hmm... I see. This is a real pickle.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> A pickle?! Leonardo, have you gone bonkers, too?!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Ah, pardon me. I was just having a bit of fun. But anyway, Romani, take a look at this Singularity.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Three minutes ago, someone Rayshifted to France. That must&#39;ve been the cause of the alarm.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Rayshift... With no authorization, and solo? You&#39;re saying the culprit escaped by Rayshifting?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I can&#39;t imagine a Servant capable of something like that...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Good point. Right now, Chaldea doesn&#39;t exist in normal dimension.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The only ones who can go outside are Master Fujimaru and contracted Servants.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> On the other hand, a Contracted Servant can do evil deeds.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But only special and extremely powerful Heroic Spirits could bend the rules of time and space.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Um, did you make a contract with such a powerful Servant?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> There are no records of it, as far as I know...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yes, but the order of cause and effect would be opposite, you see?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> We&#39;re talking about a Heroic Spirit that could bend time and space, and stretch the string of possibility for \u201Ceventually forming a contract\u201D</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> into the \u201Ceventual outcome of a contract.\u201D It would be an incredibly powerful Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...If it finds the coordinates of Chaldea using nonsensical means like that, that&#39;s incredible...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> But... I see,</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> if the culprit here is a Heroic Spirit who&#39;s willing to form a contract with Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Then the damage we suffer wouldn&#39;t be critical.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Because whatever the future, Fujimaru wouldn&#39;t form a contract with an outright villain.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No, Doctor. The problem is that we don&#39;t have any food left.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> At this rate, Senpai&#39;s health management and tea time after a Grail expedition can&#39;t be guaranteed.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> As the Master&#39;s Servant, I propose we take measures quickly.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Y-yeah, I guess this is not the time to be thinking, \u201CIf we&#39;re out of sweet dumplings, we can just have sweet bean paste instead.\u201D</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Fujimaru. For the sake of Chaldea&#39;s future,</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> and our fun Moon Festival, would you go check out the situation for us?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yes I&#39;ll go, Doctor.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I knew I could count on you. That&#39;s why you&#39;re the Master of Chaldea.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You really like sweet bean paste, huh?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Well, of course. Sugar is indispensable to someone who works with his brain.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Actually, I was more of a pancake guy, but I got addicted to it when I went to Japan. Hahaha.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> All right, Doctor, please prepare for the Rayshift. I&#39;ll get every last sweet dumpling back!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> (The culprit must be a Divine Spirit-class Servant that can Rayshift by itself...)</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> (Well, some things are better left unsaid!)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Rayshift is complete. This is\u2014the France we&#39;re familiar with, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The one who raided Chaldea&#39;s storage is here\u2014? Huh? I hear something being fired nearby...</p><p><strong>Woman:</strong> Oh my. What do we have here?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Master. There&#39;s a woman in strange clothes...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> She&#39;s holding a bow in an improper posture, firing not so effective arrows, and\u2014</p><p><strong>Werebeast:</strong> Ghraaaaaa!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> She&#39;s fighting a pack of werewolves! What&#39;s going on here?!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I don&#39;t know, but let&#39;s help her!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> For now, let&#39;s fight!</p><hr><p><strong>Woman:</strong> Oh my! Are you here to give me a hand, stranger? Hehe, aren&#39;t you a decisive one?</p><p><strong>Woman:</strong> I will take up on your kind offer. Let&#39;s fight together.</p><p><strong>Woman:</strong> We can leave the fun conversation for after the battle. Right now, let&#39;s take out these bandits!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Combat complete. But, I still sense enemies nearby.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Doctor, let me know the status of the surrounding\u2014 Doctor?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Bad connection?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Seems like it... We can perform a Rayshift to return to Chaldea from here, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Think Roman&#39;s slacking?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh? The doctor&#39;s being lazy, you think?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I can assure you that is not the case. Dr. Roman isn&#39;t the type to slack off at his job.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The more pressing concern is this woman.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um... Excuse me. You&#39;re not a normal human, are you? Are you...a Servant?</p><p><strong>Woman:</strong> Hmm? Am I a Servant? Oh, you mean a Heroic Spirit! I know all about them!</p><p><strong>Woman:</strong> Indeed! I am a Servant! The splendid hunter forever seen in the night sky\u2014</p><p><strong>Woman:</strong> My name is Orion! That&#39;s me! Round of applause, please!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You heard her, Senpai. What do you think?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Clap, clap, clap.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Hehe. Thanks for the applause. I don&#39;t know who you are, but I think we can be friends\u2661</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Wasn&#39;t Orion a guy?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Truth is stranger than fiction, you know.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> They say that Orion was a fast-talking, no-good skirt-chaser who&#39;d go after any woman he saw, but\u2014</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong> PGRYU!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Pgryu?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Hehehe. Sorry, I think that&#39;s my tummy rumbling. I haven&#39;t had anything to eat in so long.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Anyway, they say all kinds of mean things about Orion in the legend, but he&#39;s actually a pure-hearted, wonderful hunter!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> And I&#39;ve materialized to prove just that... Well? Do you believe me?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> She&#39;s appeared in order to repair her reputation... In other words, to correct an incorrect history!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I know how you feel, Miss Orion. Your skills with a bow\u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m really confused as to how you could hit a target effectively with that stance,</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> but that was really impressive! You&#39;re as good as the Greek myths say!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The legendary hero who never misses, who seduced the Goddess Artemis!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Oh my. Oh dear. Never misses, you say? Hehehehe.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Pgryyyrururur!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Your stomach again?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Aww, that&#39;s bad manners, Senpai. You shouldn&#39;t ask a girl about her tummy.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Huh? Seduced a goddess?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Oh, that&#39;s true. More specifically, he made a goddess fall in love with him\u2661</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> By the way, Miss Orion. Have you seen anyone suspicious around here?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We&#39;re looking for someone who stole a large amount of provisions from our base...</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Suspicious people... Maybe that trio I just saw?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> They were running that way carrying something strange.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> But, they were a little out of it. All the food was falling out all over the place.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> See those wolves gathering? They&#39;re here to get the food that fell out.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai! That&#39;s good information! Let&#39;s hurry and follow them!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, but we need to get those dumplings back... Especially those super rare dumplings. I have to defend them at any cost...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Huh... Super rare... What?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh\u2014that&#39;s right. You don&#39;t know about it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Mixed with the other dumplings are some special ones, made by a famous Japanese shop named Nanayabashiya.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Their taste rivals a 10,000 yen sukiyaki, and their value rivals a dozen Saint Quartz...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> They&#39;re special. I&#39;m not sure what I&#39;m saying anymore.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Mash, calm down.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh... Right. Sorry. I panicked. It&#39;s definitely not that I&#39;m hungry.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Anyway, they&#39;re very special dumplings. They&#39;re humanity&#39;s greatest treasure, and must be defended at all costs.</p><hr><p><strong>Orion:</strong> I see! I understand. Can I help, then?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> I owe you for saving me, and I need to showcase my archery skills, too. You&#39;re a Master, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> If you saw Orion being useful here, I&#39;m sure you would want to contract with her, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That would be great. Thanks for your help, Miss Orion.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yeah, let&#39;s get those dumplings.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Let the hunt begin!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Right! We&#39;ll pick up the rare dumplings as we chase after the thieves!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This is a special mission, unlike any we&#39;ve done before, but let&#39;s do our best!</p><h2 id="ep-1-antoinette-and-company" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ep-1-antoinette-and-company" aria-hidden="true">#</a> EP 1: Antoinette and Company</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I see light ahead... It&#39;s a campfire! We caught up to them, Master!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But that&#39;s\u2014that&#39;s\u2014</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Here you go, d&#39;Eon. Open wide. Say aaah\u2661</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> Th-th-thank you, Marie... Okay... Aaah.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Delicious, aren&#39;t they? They&#39;re so plump and chewy, and that sweet, sugary taste...</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> And they&#39;re so cute, like snowballs. I&#39;d love to learn how to make them.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Here, you have some, too. Aren&#39;t sweet dumplings lovely, Sanson?</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> Y-Yes... I accept this gratefully, my Queen. But is this really okay?</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> It said \u201CTake what you like,\u201D but for us to take all three tons of it...</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> My dear Sanson, you need to take what you can, when it&#39;s offered to you.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Your modesty is commendable, but it&#39;s not good to be too modest.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> What happened to the bold Sanson who readied the guillotine?</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> No... My queen, I didn&#39;t actually like the guillotine. Quite the opposite...</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> You complain too much, executioner. Her Majesty said we&#39;re taking them.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> So we shall help her do it. That&#39;s all there is to it. Fortunately, we have access to Marie&#39;s glass carriage.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> Carrying a ton or two of snacks is easy. We should&#39;ve taken more.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Heheh. d&#39;Eon understands a maiden&#39;s heart.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> They&#39;re so delicious! It&#39;s natural for a person to want as much as they can carry.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Okay, say aah\u2661</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> Aaah!</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> Wait, you&#39;re eating more?! That&#39;s too much!</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> As a man of medicine, I must advise against consuming any more calories. You&#39;ll get fat...</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Really, you don&#39;t have to worry, Sanson. Everything I eat goes right to my breasts.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> The more I eat, the bustier I get. So there&#39;s no way I&#39;ll get fat.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> Wh-what...did you...say?! I-is that true, Marie?!</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> That&#39;s medically impossible! But if it is true, I...I!</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> ...How crude. Sit down and stop panicking. But it&#39;s true, executioner.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> Her Majesty has grown to have one of the finest bodies in France. It&#39;s truly amazing.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> \u2014Tell me more! Give me more details! This is important for medical science!</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> It&#39;s not medical at all! It&#39;s something all girls have in common!</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> (...I don&#39;t know...I think it&#39;s only you, your Majesty, who doesn&#39;t have any fat go to her belly...)</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> \u2014! Chevalier!</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> I know! Get back, your Majesty!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You&#39;re all under arrest! Surrender peacefully, you dumpling thieves!</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Oh, it&#39;s you!</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> ...You&#39;re ...You&#39;re... Who are you again? Sanson, do you know them?</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> Of course not. If you think you do, you&#39;re probably imagining it.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> They&#39;re probably bandits, lured here by the light of our campfire.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> Indeed. For once we agree, executioner.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> Take up your swords, brigands! You&#39;ll pay for ruining her Majesty&#39;s snack time!</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Hm... I really do think we&#39;ve met somewhere, though...</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> I can&#39;t remember it... This is so strange... I have this feeling that we&#39;d get along great...</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> But, now that it&#39;s come to this, we shall fight! Forgive me for the rough welcome, familiar ones!</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> I&#39;m sure you have your reasons, but we&#39;re enemies now. I&#39;m not letting you have these dumplings!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s Marie for you. What a selfish declaration of war!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Let&#39;s go, Senpai! First, let&#39;s jog their memories in battle!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> Gah!</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> Tch... They bested me!</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Auuuggghhh!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The battle is over. Now we can talk\u2014</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Wait, Mash. There&#39;s one more back there. This presence... It&#39;s the same type of loser, just like my darling!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Hahaha...hahahaha... So you saw me. Impressive...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> S-Senpai! A really shady-looking pervert came out of the shadows!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I&#39;m no pervert. I am Amadeus Mask. The wandering fairy.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Oh my! Amadeus Mask! You were following us in secret again?</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> You again, pervert? Go back to Vienna!</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> Heh... I can really count on you, huh? You showed up in our hour of dire peril...</p><p><strong>Amadeus Mask:</strong> Hehehe... The one I think I&#39;d get along with dislikes me, and the one I don&#39;t care for finds me reliable... What&#39;s going on here?</p><p><strong>Amadeus Mask:</strong> Well, it doesn&#39;t matter. Maria is in trouble. I can swallow my pride and work with you, even if I don&#39;t want to.</p><p><strong>Amadeus Mask:</strong> Unknown travelers, prepare yourselves.</p><p><strong>Amadeus Mask:</strong> It&#39;s obvious that Maria and her friends are in the wrong, but you know, I don&#39;t really care.</p><p><strong>Amadeus Mask:</strong> Let us begin the symphony! Whew, I&#39;m getting excited!</p><p><strong>Amadeus Mask:</strong> Can you beat these three true perverts, now that they&#39;re orchestrated by me, the God of Music?!</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> \u2014Wait a moment. Did you just include me in your statement?!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Amadeus:</strong> So yeah. A one-star Servant like me has no chance of winning.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> You truly are the worst! All you did was slow us down!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Did you see that, Senpai? ...When Amadeus&#39; mask slipped off, it hit Sanson on the back of the head...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...And instantly knocked him out... Is that level of coordination only possible because they&#39;ve known each other for years?</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Don&#39;t worry about that, Mash. If Sanson was awake this discussion would take longer.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Marie, do you remember us now?</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Yes, as we were fighting, somewhat. There&#39;s a lot to talk about, but first, here.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> You can have these wonderful confections back. We had a small amount. I&#39;m sorry.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> (A small amount... A small amount? N-no, if her Majesty says so, then it&#39;s fine...)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No, as long we have them back, it&#39;s okay. We were going to give these equally to everyone...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh? Um...is this all? You were saying there were three tons worth a moment ago...</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> That was at the start. I did load up the carriage, but...</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> We ran into a group of three people passing by, and gave them most of the dumplings as a sign of friendship.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What?! You gave them almost three tons worth?</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Of course. When you think about it, no matter how good they are, you can&#39;t eat three tons, can you?</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> Yes, that&#39;s right. I would&#39;ve preferred you to think about that sooner, though.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s a very good point, Marie... So where did the three strangers go?</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> They said they were going to pray near the waters of Marseille. If you hurry, you might catch them.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yeah, let&#39;s hurry, Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Yeah, let&#39;s get the grinding going, Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Marie, I&#39;d love to talk more, but we&#39;re in a hurry...</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Yes, I know. Please be careful, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> May fortune smile upon your journey! Vive la France! And whassup!</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> My queen?!

I&#39;m not the type.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> Oh? Is that really true?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> It&#39;s true! You sound like you don&#39;t believe me! Are you making fun of me?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> What is your problem, anyway? Are you even a real samurai?</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> Hahaha. You saw right through me. When I have to act like a samurai, I can.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> I am a wanderer, I act differently at different times.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> But I&#39;m not the only one. You seem to be carrying such burden as well.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> A particularly big one. Tarasque, was it?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Huh!? You&#39;re after my Tarasque? Not me!?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I don&#39;t know how many wyverns you&#39;ve taken down, but I doubt you can do anything with that skimpy sword?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Don&#39;t underestimate the scales of the Tarasque. They were thick enough to withstand one of my punches!</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> Oh, your punches? How interesting. I thought your weapon was a staff?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> !!! Oh, how silly of you. Ahahah.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Perhaps you&#39;re hard of hearing? I&#39;m a saint. I would never punch anyone.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Hahaha. Come to think of it, before \u201CHe\u201D gave her the staff, St. Martha was completely empty-handed, I&#39;m told.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> So before you settled in as a Saint, you were fighting dragons with your bare hands, huh?</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> I find that fascinating. As a fellow dragon slayer, I would&#39;ve liked to have caught that with my camera.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I have not punched any dragons! I don&#39;t street-brawl anymore, and I&#39;ve never fought with my bare hands in my life!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> And Georgios, didn&#39;t you say you only photographed landscapes?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Another set of three Servants. I guess you could call these the three dragon slayers...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We&#39;re lucky Siegfried isn&#39;t here. ...Let&#39;s get ready to head in, Master!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Enough cooking and eating dumplings! Surrender peacefully to the ropes!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Huh? What&#39;s this about ropes?</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> She means to not struggle against her. In old Japan they&#39;d tie up criminal&#39;s bodies with ropes before taking them away.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> R-Ropes... Couldn&#39;t they just tie our hands... That&#39;s crazy, tying up someone&#39;s whole body...</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Criminals? I&#39;ve no idea what you&#39;re talking about.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Um, I&#39;m sorry, Mr. George. Those dumplings were stolen from Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So I think you became guilty the moment you ate them.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But if you just give them back, we can forget all about it...</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> ...I see. Even if we didn&#39;t know, how could we do such a thing?</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> We paid for this food, but if it was stolen in the first place...</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Miss, we&#39;ve never met before, but you seem to be telling the truth.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> I&#39;ll return this bag of food to you. That is the least we can do.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh...Oh, right. That would be a big help, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> We&#39;re not...fighting?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I can&#39;t believe you actually listened to us!</p><hr><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Of course. We&#39;re famous saints, you know.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> We admit when we&#39;re wrong, and strive to correct it. Though I do wish I could&#39;ve had some more.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> And only St. Georgios paid any money. Since I am not at any loss I don&#39;t really mind.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> That&#39;s right. Now, please take them. And return to this \u201CChaldea\u201D place of yours.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> I&#39;m simply a freeloader, so I have no objection. Battle solves nothing.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Everyone... Senpai, let&#39;s go back. The mission is complete!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Hmm? Wait a second.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> That was very touching, but I think that samurai&#39;s hiding a rare dumpling in his pocket.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> Hmm? Samurai? Do you mean me?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> And the saint has some behind her back, right?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Wh-what are you talking about?</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> How disgraceful, you two... I do apologize.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> I&#39;ll stay here. Feel free to take these criminals back with you.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> And you, the man with long hair, your camera pack is stuffed with hidden dumplings.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> THOU ART A DRAGON!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Mr. George...</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Huh!? What a sharp-eyed lady... It seems we have no choice but to fight...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Indeed. It&#39;s not fair to call me a thief, and I want more dumplings anyway.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Just this once, I&#39;ll abandon my holy vows. Even though they are weightier than Tarasque.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Tarasque&#39;s pretty light then, huh?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Kojirou, you fight, as well. You&#39;ve eaten plenty of free food up until now.</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> Yes, I&#39;ve got nothing to do with this, but fair enough. You shall taste the wrath of my secret blade.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> They&#39;re coming, Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That&#39;s the problem with saints...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Right! They weren&#39;t listening to us at all!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> What have I done... What got into me?</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> It must be the magical energy of the moon that compelled me to use Ascalon.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Please realize, milady... The true enemy...is close at hand... (ka-thud)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Georgios?!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Mr. George!?</p><hr><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> ...I never before fought out of greed, and now greed has dulled my blade...</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> In the moment greed took over, my defeat was assured... Bean paste buns are scary...</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> Oh, and I was strangely strong not because I&#39;m on my home ground, but because of my class affinity? (ka-thud)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> LEGEND OF SAMURAI?!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Kojirou what&#39;s-his-name!?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Both of them died well... We have the dumplings right here, so I&#39;ll get some incense for the funeral.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> They haven&#39;t disappeared. They&#39;re just pretending to pass out because they&#39;re embarrassed.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Men can be so proud over the silliest things. Who cares if you lose a fight?</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> A brutal strike! DWAH!</p><p><strong>Kojirou:</strong> Such merciless truth! KWAH!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...That one really did knock them out.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...Is she really a saint?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s true that men and women may have different views on fighting.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Statistical data shows that women engage in competition on a daily basis, and don&#39;t obsess over a single defeat.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> They&#39;d prefer to use the extra calories obsessing over more constructive things, I hear.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Is that true for you, too?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I...I don&#39;t know. I haven&#39;t fought enough to really find value in the outcome of a fight.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, but this is just statistical data. It differs for each individual.</p><hr><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Hey, guys, I hate to interrupt, but that scary woman is running straight for the sea.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Hahahaha! It&#39;s too late! Come forth, Tarasque! Scramble ride!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I&#39;m outta here, kiddies! Next time we meet, I&#39;ll get you for this!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh! The sea parted, and a dragon came out... No, a turtle? An extremely tired-looking iron dragon?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Whatever it is, it&#39;s spinning up into the sky!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It looks just like an unidentified flying object, doesn&#39;t it, Senpai?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yeah, that&#39;s what everyone thought.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> She just made the morning papers.</p><hr><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Oh, but as a way of expressing our gratitude for the dumplings...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Yes, we did buy them off of a strange group in a glass carriage\u2014</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> But later we ran into a fat man calling himself an emperor, and gave him the other half.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> He was very skilled at persuasion...A professional debtor. The type who never pays back what he owes.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Be careful! You&#39;ll find him in the wasteland!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Hmm, after saying all that, she just flew off.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Looks like we&#39;ve got more work to do. I don&#39;t mind, though. I&#39;m having fun.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> What will you do, Mash, Fujimaru? If you&#39;re going to give up, now might be the time.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No, we&#39;ll get as many dumplings back as we can.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Let&#39;s go, Master. That fat man is definitely our next foe!</p><h2 id="ep-3-moon-over-the-ruined-castle" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ep-3-moon-over-the-ruined-castle" aria-hidden="true">#</a> EP 3: Moon Over the Ruined Castle</h2><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Not bad. Not bad at all. I prefer plump, delicious fruit, but this is not bad.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Excellent form. Easy to transport. Keeps for days.

I can&#39;t stop putting them in my mouth!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Once you start, you just can&#39;t stop! I&#39;ve got no choice but to eat all the dumplings in the world!</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong> WWAAARRHH! NNEERROOO!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Heh, I see you&#39;re devouring them, too. You&#39;re not a true Roman emperor unless you love to eat.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Though I guess I&#39;m not really an emperor. I just laid the foundations for an empire.</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong> WAAARGGHH! FATSO!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> I am not fat! I am plump!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> There&#39;s a huge pile of dumplings behind them... We finally reached our main target, I guess.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> What will you do? Try to talk to them?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I don&#39;t think that&#39;ll work.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Let&#39;s heed Martha&#39;s warning.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Y-yes... The tyrant Caligula is a Berserker. We won&#39;t be able to talk to him.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Caesar is a Saber, so we can communicate with him, but he&#39;s also a little TOO good at talking.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> If we try to talk to him, he might just \u201Cround\u201D up the conversation in his favor.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Yeah...He&#39;s really...round.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> For now, let&#39;s approach them, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> If we attack them from the front then we&#39;re in accordance with the laws of chivalry, we won&#39;t be cowards.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You seem like you&#39;re getting angry.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Chival...ry?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Stop acting like a food processor.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Those provisions belong to Chaldea, not Rome!</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong> ...?

What is...the meaning...of this?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Stop comparing me to things that are round!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> ...Sigh. You interrupted my wonderful snack time... A mess. This is truly a mess.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> But I guess you&#39;ve appeared at last. You&#39;re here for these Moon Festival dumplings, right?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> I managed to embezzle these from that wicked Rider...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (Senpai, did he just say \u201Cembezzle?\u201D I&#39;m not hearing that wrong, right?)</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> And I have a just reason for doing so. Well? Will you listen to me, milady?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> You will, of course! Everyone listens to me!

Let&#39;s just fight. Yeah. Fight.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m not really interested in the reason. Please just give them back...</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Ahem. I haven&#39;t introduced myself. How could I forget?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> I am none other than the famous flower of Rome, the Crimson Swordsman, Red Saber!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Sorry. You&#39;re going to get sued for that.</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong> Impossible!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Hmm, no good, huh? I thought I could pull it off.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> And Caligula, you too?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Anyway, allow me to continue. Traveling this bountiful land, I encountered a delicious scent.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> And then\u2014</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You came, you saw, you bought! Right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I understand how you feel, but be quiet, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ... (Deliberately say nothing)</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> ...No response, huh? Sad...How very sad...</p><hr><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Anyway, I sensed a wicked plot was involved. Thinking I should probably take action, I confiscated them.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> But if they were stolen, I can understand your anger. A sense of righteousness can create stronger feelings than revenge.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> I dislike fighting. It&#39;s a pain. So let&#39;s do this.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> First, I will trust you, and give you back these dumplings.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> You will go around and sell them at three times the price, then come back.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> I&#39;ll take the money, and give you no less than double what they&#39;re worth!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Well? Your gain, not loss, and I get the satisfaction of having trusted you.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> How about I give them back to you under these terms?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Ooh...So peaceful!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Calm down, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> I&#39;m easily tricked, so I&#39;m not one to talk, but you&#39;re being tricked right now!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Ooh...Such a rip-off!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s right, Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Martha was correct. Talking to Caesar is a waste of time.</p><hr><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Hmm. It didn&#39;t work, huh? I tried copying Cleopatra...</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> But, very well. Fighting it is. Caligula, prepare yourself.</p><p><strong>Caligula:</strong> KWAAAOOOHH! They&#39;re clearly in the right, but WWWRROOAAH!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Heh. Come, then!

If only there were a class where I could win more easily.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Combat complete. We won, Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We&#39;ll take the dumplings back, then. Now we can return to Chaldea\u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh? It&#39;s so...heavy?! I was able to carry it before, but...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...Nom nom...nom nom...</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Wait, Mash?!

Have I cut the bag, as well? Forgive me. I do not destroy life. (Nom nom)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Something crazy came out?!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s um...Who is that? It&#39;s clearly a top-class Servant, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Well, he had to be a good guy at the end...</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Indeed. I suppose it&#39;s Caligula&#39;s destiny to be killed through a cloth...</p><hr><p><strong>Orion:</strong> No way...Altera?! What&#39;s she doing here?!</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> Why are you surprised, woman? Wherever there is civilization, I appear.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Altera? The Great King of the Western World, a warrior of the Huns, the avatar of destruction?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> But how did she get here? And how exactly did she get inside that bag?!</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> I walked here, basically. Rayshift is civilization, so I do not use it.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> You walked again?!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> ...Mash, Fujimaru. She looks calm, but don&#39;t underestimate that woman.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> She&#39;s a natural predator, not just of us, but of you humans.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> She destroys any buildings she sees, as well as some she doesn&#39;t see. She doesn&#39;t target anything of nature, but she ends up destroying it too.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> She&#39;s a giant pain in the neck, who destroys everything around her just by walking.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> That is a misunderstanding. I do make distinctions.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> In the end, it comes to feelings. I&#39;ve realized there are different types of civilization.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> Nom, mmm. Basically, there are both good and bad civilizations.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> Dumplings are good civilization. Moon Festival is bad civilization.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> So I am taking these dumplings, nom, and destroying you for having Moon Festivals, nom.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> If you get in my way, I will show no mercy.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> I will use this War God&#39;s sword, I happened to find on the ground, to destroy you.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> What do you mean \u201Chappened to find?\u201D Anything you use turns into that thing!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Hmm, this is bad. I&#39;ll help you! I can&#39;t let what happened to Rome be repeated!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master! The mysterious enemy Servant is coming! We&#39;ll fight her with everything we&#39;ve got!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> ...Well, that was not successful. The dumplings were good, though.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> Oh\u2014When will this dream\u2014When will my Noble Phantasm attain its true power\u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Good...The enemy Servant has vanished. Now we can finally\u2014</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Whew! Finally made it through! Hello? Hello?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Are you two okay!? I just detected an incredible vortex of magical energy!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Doctor, are communications back? ...Did you activate the Rayshift?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Yeah, I detected the provisions near you, and activated the Rayshift.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> You have nothing else left to do, right? Then hurry and come back to Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The Moon Festival party will be waiting for you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes...That&#39;s right. We did achieve our goals, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Huh? Where&#39;s Orion?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s right. I don&#39;t see her anymore. I wanted to thank her for her help...</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Hmph. I&#39;m still here. Do you have any goodbyes for me?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You were useless against Altera.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> I can&#39;t help it. It&#39;s my class affinity. I wouldn&#39;t be more useful than that woman Archer.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Want to join us for the Moon Festival at Chaldea?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> No, thank you. The offer is enough. Unknown Master, I hope we meet again someday.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Thank you for your help, though.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Just having you on our side was a big help.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Yes, it means one less enemy. You understand war well.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> And so I shall give you one final warning.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> When it comes to food, the first owner and the last owner are different.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> So who is the true owner of these dumplings?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Was it the one who prepared them? No. The one who cooked them? Even less so.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Then who do they belong to? They belong to the one who is last to eat them.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> You claimed ownership of the dumplings, but from \u201Cthat person&#39;s\u201D perspective, that&#39;s nothing but a joke.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Listen well. If you fail to realize this, the truth will remain forever hidden in darkness.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Caesar, what do you mean?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Hahahaha! Stay hungry, and you&#39;ll find the answer someday!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Farewell, farewell to you, girl with a bosom that&#39;s soft like a dumpling!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I-I take back my thank you! I think Rome is a bad civilization!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I was a little worried for a while there, but I&#39;m glad to see you both safe.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> We&#39;re handing out all the dumplings you recovered now. The Moon Festival party will begin soon.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Just rest a little until then.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;d love to know what happened out there, but I&#39;ll wait.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> You can tell all the staff about your adventures.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Sure, but, um...Doctor. Did you find the cause of the communications problem?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> O-Oh, no. I couldn&#39;t find it. All our equipment was working normally.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> But if there was a cause\u2014</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It wouldn&#39;t be on Chaldea&#39;s side, but your own.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Some kind of problem should have shown up during the time you Rayshifted and when the comms came back online...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Fujimaru, any idea?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...A little.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...Pick...Up...</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Well, if it wasn&#39;t a problem, you can forget it. Good work out there!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Enjoy the rest of your time at the Moon Festival party!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Something doesn&#39;t feel right.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I still feel like... I want some more rare dumplings.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We haven&#39;t caught the thief, and the greatest question still remains.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Who was that Orion?</p><h2 id="ep-4-does-moon-goddess-dream-of-dumplings" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ep-4-does-moon-goddess-dream-of-dumplings" aria-hidden="true">#</a> EP 4: Does Moon Goddess Dream of Dumplings?</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> These...appear to be the hills of France...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But what are we doing here? We were gathering rare dumplings...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Hehehe. I&#39;ll tell you, Mash.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> \u201CThank you for all the work you&#39;ve done for me and Orion. Good job, you two!\u201D</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Just kidding! Good evening, Master of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Miss Orion!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Hey, how&#39;ve you been, Mash\u2661 It&#39;s a bit late, but do you need an introduction and explanation?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yeah, I think we kind of do.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Hehe. Soft on the outside, and prickly where it counts. I like it.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> All right, time to explain! I was the one who attacked Chaldea&#39;s food supply!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Or at least, that was the plan. But it didn&#39;t work.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Um, I virtually proved the causality of being summoned by you, and managed to get into Chaldea,</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> but then it was just one failure after another. Lots of nasty traps kept me out of the storage.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> All I could do was transport your entire storage into the Singularity.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> And once I&#39;d done that, I jumped to retrieve them, but...</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> By an unfortunate coincidence, a passing queen got to them before I could.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> You know the rest. I chased after the dumplings,</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> gathered almost enough rare dumplings for the special Craft Essence, and waited for the time of my full revival!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> No, I think we&#39;re good.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> R-Really? Hmm, you don&#39;t need an explanation, huh?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> But, that&#39;s fine. It makes this easier. All that&#39;s left to do is fight.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So you were the real culprit? But why?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> For the dumplings, of course. The dumplings.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> The dumplings are a manifestation of faith, created for the moon... An offering to the moon.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Do you understand? They&#39;re a way to win the favor of the gods and bring them here.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Even if Chaldea didn&#39;t intend for it to happen, doing a ritual like that in a place with a summoning system...</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> ...was enough for me to awaken. More specifically, it slapped me awake.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> But when I woke up, I was starving. I didn&#39;t have nearly enough magical energy.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> So I wanted dumplings. The sacrifices that were created for me.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> They are thoughts, created for me. A rare source of magical energy that exists to feed me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Then\u2014for the last few days Senpai and I have been running around to try and revive you!?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> That&#39;s right\u2661 But please don&#39;t treat me as evil or anything.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> I&#39;m on your side...well, I&#39;m not. But, I&#39;m not your enemy.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> If my darling is on your side, then I&#39;m willing to be, too.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Anyway, thanks to all the rare dumplings that Fujimaru found, I can join your other Servants.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> All that&#39;s left is to wait for you to summon me\u2014 But first, don&#39;t you think we need to test your skills?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> [\u2642 Agreed. You&#39;ll pay for tricking me. /\u2640 Agreed. You&#39;re going to regret this.]</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Hmm... I guess you&#39;re right. I didn&#39;t trick you, but it is true that I was having fun...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Can we talk instead of fight?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Impossible. I don&#39;t like humans to start with. And I dislike the weak ones the most.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> So I want you to show me that you&#39;re strong enough to beat selfish, unreasonable, and inhuman old me.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Otherwise, you can&#39;t handle a Servant like me.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Sigh...I figured it would end like this.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But I was kind of ready for it, so it&#39;s fine!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Mash Kyrielight\u2014 Ready to go, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Right! Let&#39;s beat this goddess, Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Orion:</strong> That&#39;s the spirit! Let me reintroduce myself then.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> I am the deity of moonlight, the elegant representation of purity, virginity, hunting, and eternity\u2014</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> One of the ancient gods of Mt. Olympus! I, the Moon Goddess Artemis, shall test you!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> I hope you do well. Try and beat me, just like my darling did that day\u2661</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Kyaaahh! You! Beat! Me!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We did it! A perfect victory, Master! We defeated the Moon Goddess Artemis!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> (Sob, sob) I told you to fight hard, but you didn&#39;t have to hit THAT hard... Oww!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Now causality is established. I don&#39;t know when we&#39;ll meet again.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Maybe when we do, I won&#39;t remember Mash, or you, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> But I have become a part of you. The Moon Goddess shall flow from Olympus to Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No... Goddess Artemis is disappearing...</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Aww, silly. Next time, just call me Artemis, Mash.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> This is just a temporary goodbye. I&#39;m sure that before long...we&#39;ll see each other again on those familiar seas.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Until then, goodbye! It wasn&#39;t very long, but I enjoyed our Moon Festival night adventure!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Artemis...disappeared.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> We&#39;ll see her again.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You&#39;re right. Even if none of us remember what happened tonight, I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll be able to get along.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I hope we can see her again.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We will. She loves humanity so much. I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll see her soon.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I know she said she didn&#39;t like humans, but I&#39;m sure that&#39;s just because she can&#39;t leave us alone.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...The dream is ending. Our night of adventure is coming to a close.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Good work this time. I&#39;ll see you when you wake up, Senpai.</p>',684),a=[n];function g(i,h){return o(),e("div",null,a)}var u=t(s,[["render",g],["__file","dumplings.html.vue"]]);export{u as default};
