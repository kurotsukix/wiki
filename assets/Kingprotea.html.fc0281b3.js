Where am I...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Did I take a wrong turn somewhere...?</p><hr><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> Mistakes were made. What were you thinking, leaving SE.RA.PH under these circumstances?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> Ever hear of curiosity killing the cat? Or did the sight of this deep-sea beauty make you go soft in the head?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> Not that either case says anything good about your intelligence! Now I&#39;ve got to step in to help clean up your mess, stupid!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Do I know you...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...Who are you again...?</p><hr><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> Hmm. So, your perception is just as shot as I thought. You aren&#39;t able to reconcile what you&#39;re seeing now with your own memories, huh?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> Your mind and memories are both still sharp, but they&#39;re having trouble accessing what happened here.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> You&#39;re now essentially back to square one...a rookie Master who barely knows what [\u2642 he&#39;s /\u2640 she&#39;s] doing.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> Ah, well. I suppose I&#39;ll have to pull out all the stops to help your sorry ass!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> I&#39;m H. C. A., the electronic fairy in charge of this trash compactor...the Cage of the Fallen, Klein Cube.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> You can think of me as an acquaintance of BB, since she&#39;s the one who summoned me, not Chaldea.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> An acquaintance of BB...?</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> That&#39;s right. We&#39;ve only ever talked online, though.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> But I&#39;m not a digital demon like her. I&#39;m more like a Rogue Servant.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> I have plenty of time on my hands, and I only want to spend it working on my stories at your world&#39;s outskirts. I really don&#39;t have any desire to get involved with your world.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;m sorry, what was your name again?</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> ...I&#39;m H. C. A., an electronic fairy. Ugh, it&#39;s kinda hard to actually say that without cringing.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> I know no one else is going to hear this, but still, it&#39;s really damn embarrassing.</p><hr><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> Anyway, let&#39;s start by breaking down where you are and what&#39;s going on here.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> Right now, that building sinking to the bottom of the sea that looks like a bad joke... Sorry, Freudian slip.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> That building used to be an oil rig called Seraphix...but now, it&#39;s called SE.RA.PH, and none of the standard laws of physics apply to it.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> In SE.RA.PH, time doesn&#39;t flow in only one direction. Instead, it&#39;s something that can be measured in some interesting ways.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> And the spacing on the calipers used to measure it is nothing like your conception of physical space.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> That&#39;s probably because time and space are both measured from a one-dimensional perspective there.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> Sometimes, you can even be in two different times while in the same space. This area we&#39;re in now is proof.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> Here, neither BB nor SE.RA.PH can touch us. Why? Well, think of us as being a failed timeline.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> Even though Seraphix is currently in the process of being reborn as SE.RA.PH, a purely digital structure...</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> ...this place we&#39;re in now was produced as a sort of nonexistent space, even in the original SE.RA.PH.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> What for, you say? To get rid of anything unwanted, obviously.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> Think of it as the oil rig equivalent of sweeping things under the rug.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> Humans have always been good at ignoring things they&#39;d rather not think about. It&#39;s one of their best defense mechanisms.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> This is rather like that, only more so. Like sweeping things under a rug, then destroying both it and the rug so thoroughly it is as if they never existed.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> Now this place is beyond all things, outside thought and knowledge, a place where one cannot normally reach.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So...it&#39;s like the Trash Heap?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Does that mean it&#39;s like that one pitfall?</p><hr><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> Good! That&#39;s pretty much the right idea! This place is basically a hole, like a cave or a tree hollow!</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> That gravitational field continues on to a place absolutely no one knows about. It&#39;s almost like a trash can where the bottom is thousands of light-years away.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> However...while this cage was originally supposed to sink into the void forever...</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> ...the one who recreated SE.RA.PH, unbelievable as it may be, seems to have also gone to the trouble of recreating its surrounding data.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> She knew about the danger involved, and went ahead with it anyway because she thought it seemed fun.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> This kind of reckless laziness is just like her. She wants everything she sees, but she can&#39;t even be bothered to get out of bed.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> I knew she had a cow&#39;s tits, but I didn&#39;t know she had a cow&#39;s brain too! Hell, maybe those horns of hers are actually something she was born with!</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> Still, that alone wouldn&#39;t be too much of a problem. It&#39;s only now that another idiot&#39;s got [\u2642 himself /\u2640 herself] mixed up in all this that it&#39;s become such a mess.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Another idiot...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What idiot?</p><hr><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> You&#39;re the idiot! It&#39;s you!</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> What else would you call someone who just waltzes into a place they don&#39;t even need to be during an ultra time-sensitive emergency!?</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> Now that you being here has accidentally proved this place exists, the proverbial gates of hell are about to be thrown wide open!</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> That gravitational field didn&#39;t even exist until you showed up. Same with the path that brought me here.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> Oh well. I hate physical labor, but I love seeing idiots get what&#39;s coming to them.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> Now listen up, Fujimaru. There&#39;s a Servant sleeping at the very bottom of this hole.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> A monster so awful that even BB threw her hands up pretending not to see it, and so dreadful even that lazy cow gave up on it.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> She&#39;s still sleeping right now, but it&#39;s only a matter of time until she starts looking for you in her dreams.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> Now that you&#39;ve opened this place up, you two have practically already locked eyes.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> If you leave here now, she&#39;ll sort of wander outside in her sleep, looking for you.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> And if that happens, it&#39;s game over. You and everyone on SE.RA.PH will be utterly obliterated.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Th-that&#39;s awful!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> So, then...what should I do?</p><hr><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> Oh. Finally starting to understand how bad this is, are we? Good. Now is the time for action.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> You&#39;re the one who opened this hole, so you&#39;re the one who has to close it.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> And to do that, you need to defeat the monster who&#39;s been relegated to the bottom layer of the trash compactor.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> Once she falls at your hand, she should remember that no one needs or wants her, and go back to sleep.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Okay. So I just have to get to the bottom, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> By the way, what are you doing here?</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> Oh, that? I&#39;m just the odd spirit out. SE.RA.PH might be summoning Heroic Spirits from throughout all of history...</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> ...but it&#39;s also set up so that I can never get inside. Call it a mental block made tangible.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> Who knows why she even bothers! I can only guess she must have something she really doesn&#39;t want me to see, though I couldn&#39;t even begin to guess what might be worth hiding at this point!</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> If she&#39;s gonna be that embarrassed about it, she could start by giving her mind a good, thorough scrubbing!</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> Of course, she&#39;d need to work AWFULLY hard to get all the dirt out! Hell, she could probably spend a lifetime in a washtub and it still wouldn&#39;t be enough!</p><hr><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> ...Anyway, enough chatter. You&#39;ve got a long way to go before you reach the bottom.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> The whole place is full of things that were tossed out for being too dangerous, just like her.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> You&#39;ll have to defeat all of them before you can reach the Cage of the Fallen.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> Now go, Fujimaru! Whatever you accomplish here, it better be at least good enough for a special edition book&#39;s cover art!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> ...Good, you finally made it to the bottom. Now, before you go on, let me tell you a little story.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> This story took place on the Far Side of the Moon, a world entirely different from yours.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> Back when BB was modifying herself over and over to help her corrode the Mooncell, she ended up creating five clones.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> These clones were High Servants, made by fusing the growing emotions she could no longer control with the essences of various goddesses.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> These Alter Egos came to be known collectively as the Sakura Five.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> Meltryllis, the Alter Ego of pleasure. Passionlip, the Alter Ego of love and hatred.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> And Kingprotea, the Alter Ego of yearning, is the one being compressed right over there.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> She&#39;s a sentient life-form who will grow and expand to infinity if left unchecked, and can only exist digitally.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> Left to her own devices, this walking disaster would consume SE.RA.PH and the Mooncell, eventually contaminating the ocean of stars.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Kingprotea...</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> Right. Don&#39;t let her current six-sided appearance deceive you.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> This entire gravitational field is being generated by Protea herself. If that cube opens up\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> She doesn&#39;t look all that dangerous...</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> That&#39;s only because she&#39;s been reset to level one. She&#39;s practically a newborn right now.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> And even then, just look at all these gravitational fluctuations she&#39;s causing. If she were ever to get out into the physical world\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> Here she comes! She grows bigger with every passing second, so you can&#39;t let this fight drag on!</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> Blast her with everything you&#39;ve got right away! If you can hit her faster than she can grow, you&#39;ll win!</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> Another option, though I don&#39;t recommend it, is to hold out for as long as possible! Even a monster like her has limits!</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> There should be a moment of vulnerability when she&#39;s transitioning to her next growth phase that you can take advantage of!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> The cube&#39;s cracking...!</p><hr><p><strong>Kingprotea:</strong> Love me... Love me... Please...love me...</p><p><strong>Kingprotea:</strong> I just want...someone to love me... But nobody...ever does...</p><p><strong>Kingprotea:</strong> Please...tell me why I was born... Please...help me quench my thirst...</p><p><strong>Kingprotea:</strong> I&#39;m so hungry... No matter how much I have...it&#39;s never enough...</p><p><strong>Kingprotea:</strong> Oh... You&#39;re the one who found me...aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Kingprotea:</strong> I love you. I love you. I love you. So please...</p><p><strong>Kingprotea:</strong> Please give yourself to me. Please allow me to live.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Kingprotea:</strong> Ah...</p><p><strong>Kingprotea:</strong> So, this means...I&#39;m going to disappear, doesn&#39;t it... Now I&#39;ll never...get to go outside...</p><p><strong>Kingprotea:</strong> Still...</p><p><strong>Kingprotea:</strong> At least...you came all this way... You weren&#39;t afraid of me...</p><p><strong>Kingprotea:</strong> I hate my mother, but...my memories of her...are warm...</p><p><strong>Kingprotea:</strong> All I wanted...was to touch someone... That&#39;s all I needed...to be fulfilled...</p><p><strong>Kingprotea:</strong> Even though our contact was barely enough to satisfy my curiosity...I&#39;m still glad I got to touch you.</p><p><strong>Kingprotea:</strong> I&#39;m so happy I met someone stronger than me.</p><p><strong>Kingprotea:</strong> Hehe... The universe really is a big place, isn&#39;t it. Maybe this means...</p><p><strong>Kingprotea:</strong> ...I&#39;ll still get to be...a beautiful blushing bride...someda\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Did I really do the right thing...?</p><hr><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> About Kingprotea, you mean? It may not have been the happiest solution, but yes, it was the right one.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> That thing has no place in a digital world.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> In a world without physical limits, Protea has no way of escaping her own ego\u2013her t\u1E5B\u0301\u1E63\u1E47\u0101.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> Buddhism teaches that love is essentially a heart that never stops yearning.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> It is du\u1E63k\u1E5Bta, in which no matter how much you eat, how fulfilled you feel, or how much you grow...</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> ...it will always leave you wanting more. Such longing is a black hole for the mind.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> No matter how much love you give it, it will never truly be full. And so long as it is not full, the heart can never hope to grow.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> That Alter Ego can never hope to find salvation as long as she&#39;s in SE.RA.PH.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> However, in a physical world, with firm laws and built-in limits, that&#39;s a different story.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> After all, once you&#39;ve run out of food or can&#39;t grow anymore, that&#39;s proof that your cup runneth over.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> So if a certain Master with freakishly weird taste decided to try summoning that monster just for kicks...</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> Who knows? [\u2642 He /\u2640 She] might just miraculously succeed at saving her without changing her monstrous nature.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> Anyway, now that Kingprotea is gone, the gravitational fluctuations have followed suit. This little side story has officially come to an end, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> It&#39;s time for you to get back to the main plot. Go laugh that ridiculous cyber city out of existence!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...I&#39;ll do my best!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Aren&#39;t you gonna help me, electronic fairy?</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> Didn&#39;t I already tell you? I don&#39;t do hard labor. I mean, just look at me. My claim to fame is writing fairy tales.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> I&#39;d need to make the story a whole lot more exciting before I could show my face in the epilogue!</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> So I&#39;ll sit this one out and let you guys handle it. If I showed up now, I&#39;d end up making the ending one big anticlimax.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> Believe me, I have every confidence I&#39;d take the wind out of that cow&#39;s sails with my sweet nothings!</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> That said, there&#39;s no way she&#39;d be satisfied with only dying off once.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> She&#39;d just come right back to life, and I&#39;d have to destroy her all over again. It wouldn&#39;t actually resolve anything.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> No, the only kind of person who can really break her spirit is a fool like you, not a twisted guy like me.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> Of course, if you try to face her directly, she&#39;ll probably just wipe you all out, but I&#39;m sure you can figure a way around that if you put your mind to it.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> So once this is all wrapped up...make sure you tell the other version of me all about this someday. It&#39;ll give him a good laugh.</p><p><strong>H. C. A.:</strong> Consider that my reward for showing you the way here. Now go out there and win one for the fairy!</p><hr>',174),a=[r];function i(h,g){return e(),o("div",null,a)}var p=t(s,[["render",i],["__file","Kingprotea.html.vue"]]);export{p as default};
