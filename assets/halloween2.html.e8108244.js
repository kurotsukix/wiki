Are you ready for this?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> Also, is my makeup on right?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> ...Of course, me. We&#39;ll defeat the witch and take back Castle Csejte!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> And of course my makeup&#39;s perfect! It&#39;s me we&#39;re talking about!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> Yup! By the way... Why are there two of us?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> Well, it doesn&#39;t really matter,</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> If you ask me, by splitting into two, our idol coefficient&#39;s gone up several thousand times.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> Even my idol frenemy got a bride costume so...</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> That&#39;s right! If there are two of her, there should be two of me!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> Exactly! Smart thinking, me!

It&#39;s So Sweet!\u201D</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> ...is about to begin!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> Ticket sales are projected to completely sell out! I had to reserve some tickets for Chaldea!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> As such, I can&#39;t let the schedule get messed up, now, can I?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> ...Which is why I need to take back the castle, me!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> Okay, let&#39;s go! Ready, set, go!</p><p><strong>Both:</strong> Excuse me!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Who&#39;s making all that noise? It&#39;s the middle of the night! Why can&#39;t you be quiet?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...Hmm. Why, if it isn&#39;t two ugly little girls!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Oooh... You little shrimp aren&#39;t very fashionable at all. What a sin it is to be like you!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> And I am disgusted. Disgusted! You cling to the glories of the past...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> You&#39;re so focused on something that you fail to see the bigger picture!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Yet I will accept that my glory must have blinded you. So sorry!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> Huh? Oh, uh, no. But thank you.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Humph! Don&#39;t get the wrong idea. It&#39;s not like I was trying to be considerate or anything when I said that!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Now get back to your dank little caves, you scrawny lizards!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Because, as you&#39;re quite well aware, staying out late is very bad for the skin!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> Tch... She gives off such a powerful aura just by standing there...! Her idol coefficient is really high like always!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> Jeez! I understand why I would shake in the presence of a powerful enemy, but for now, just concentrate!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> I-I know that! Now get ready, witch!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> You make me laugh! I&#39;ve never gotten myself ready for anything! Because\u2014</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Because my heart is free as a feather! I have no worries about anything!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> Ugh... this self-confidence and boastful attitude... She reminds me of someone...!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> She&#39;s like a woman I see every single morning... when I&#39;m checking myself in the mirror...!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> And, obviously, the word \u201Cwitch\u201D is inappropriate for me.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> \u201CWitch\u201D in this region refers not to an embodiment of beauty such as me, but rather to that Halloween girl next to you, right?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> This is just a stage outfit based on the concept of a witch! I&#39;m the mistress of this castle!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Hahaha! Hahahahahahaha!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> You may not look that great, but you&#39;ve got a real sense of humor! It&#39;s tasteless, low-class, and ridiculous!</p><p><strong>Both:</strong> WHAT DID YOU SAY!?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Hahaha. If you&#39;re telling me that the job of a castle mistress entails wearing a ridiculous outfit like that, even I can&#39;t help but laugh.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Actually, I&#39;m tired from laughing so much. I&#39;m going to bed.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I&#39;m the owner of this castle now. Naturally, I am also assuming direct control of these lands as well.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Being a ruler is much too difficult for tryhard lizards like the two of you! Now be good little commoners and quietly take your leave!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Hahaha! But I don&#39;t know if freeloading nobles like you can handle the life of a commoner!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> What...!?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> What did you say!?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Don&#39;t scream at me. It&#39;s like listening to surround sound.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> Shut up! You took my Castle Csejte without asking!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> You&#39;re not even from the right culture anyway!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> You don&#39;t match Castle Csejte at all!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...? Are you so excited that you haven&#39;t even bothered to look outside?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Hahaha. It&#39;s too late. Behold the snake that foretells the end!</p><p><strong>Both:</strong> Huh?</p><p><strong>Both:</strong> Something weird&#39;s sticking out!?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Oh, you&#39;re back! Good evening! You do know I&#39;m actually really busy?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> What is that!? Why is my castle a pyramid!?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> Actually, why is the pyramid upside down!?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> The castle&#39;s all smooshed! All you did was stack it on top! Talk about cutting corners!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Hahaha, you&#39;ve got me there, little lizards! But I&#39;ll tell you one thing:</p><p><strong>???:</strong> This is remodeling!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Farewell to that nasty, disgusting prison castle! What this era wants is simplicity!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> The golden ratio is the basis of beauty in this world! That&#39;s right! Just like me! Exactly like me!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> No, it looks really out of place. I mean, this is Europe... Besides, how is that \u201Cremodeling\u201D!?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Avant-garde! Hakone! Art park! Museum!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Anyway, this castle is under my control! But I understand beauty. I&#39;m not a monster.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> If you insist on holding a concert, out of respect for the former owners, I will offer you a place.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Yes... I know exactly where! How about that stable?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> That&#39;s rock n&#39; roll style right there! You can jam in the same kind of place that holy man was born in!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Hahaha! It&#39;s fine, it&#39;s fine. No need to thank me with words! Just bow down before me in gratitude!</p><p><strong>Both:</strong> Hell no!!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Humph. So negotiations failed, huh? ...How disappointing.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I guess I have no choice then. Behold my power!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...Is what I&#39;d like to say, but fighting directly isn&#39;t elegant. It&#39;s bad for my skin, too.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> So I&#39;ll leave that to my stand-in. Fierce, ugly knight of steel, come forth!</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Tristan the Tragic has arrived.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> What...?</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong> As has Lancelot the Sorrowful.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> No way...!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Now then, I have to get back to my book. Finish them by the time I&#39;m done, you losers!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Of course, if you fail, you&#39;re banished. I have no use for men whose only redeeming quality is their beauty.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> How sad... You&#39;re underestimating our power, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong> I agree with Tristan. We&#39;ll have this finished before you can read the next sentence.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong> Now then. It&#39;s time for you to go.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> H-Hey, time out!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> We&#39;re here to fight with that nasty woman over there!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> A truly good mistress has talented retainers. Heh... I&#39;m so perfect.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Oh, I&#39;ll give you one last bit of advice.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Remember this face, for it is my consolation to you.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> After all, they say seeing beautiful things makes you more beautiful, right?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> Why, you...! Let&#39;s do this, me!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> Wah!?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> Funyah!?</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Now go. We weren&#39;t told to take your lives.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong> You cannot beat us, let alone our mistress.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong> You need to grow at least 10 years older, cute little girls.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> Waah! We lost to a couple of literal homewreckers!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> W-We&#39;ll get you for this! You COUGAR LOVER!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> We&#39;ll be back! Real soon!</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong> Hahaha. I look forward to it. Now let&#39;s go, Lord Tristan.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> ...Homewreckers...</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong> (He&#39;s genuinely shocked that she called him that!)</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> (Panting) W-We made it out okay, somehow, but...</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> What do we do, me!? We can&#39;t hold our concert at this rate...</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> I hate to say it, but we can&#39;t handle this on our own.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> ...Uncle Vlad is away on business...</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> And Tamamo Cat said, \u201CWoof! I&#39;m leaving on a journey for paws unknown!\u201D and quit her job.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> By the way, do you think she was lying about why she quit? Were we tricked?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> It doesn&#39;t matter. No, I mean, it does matter, but...</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> Waah! If only my [\u2642 Puppy /\u2640 Deerlet] were here!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> No sense in complaining about what we can&#39;t have.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> Ugh! I&#39;m so pathetic, relying on others and whatnot!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> Humph. S-So what, me!? Do you have any good ideas?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> N-No, but...</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> Then stop complaining!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> Wh-What!? You don&#39;t have any ideas either, do you?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> You&#39;re stupid, so just shut up!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> Argh! You&#39;re me, so you&#39;re stupid too!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> I&#39;m a Caster, which makes me one rank higher than you in intelligence!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> There is no such stat!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> ...And you know what? I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s a good idea for Caster me to be one rank lower in MP either!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> Gah! You know that&#39;s a sore spot for me!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> What, you wanna fight!?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> \uFF06\uFF04\uFF03\u3013\uFF05\uFF06\u2227\xA7\u2019\uFF08\uFF06\uFF08\uFF05\uFF06\uFF09\uFF09!!!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> \u201D\uFF09\u203B\uFF04\u3013\u3013\uFF0A\uFF40\uFF05\u201D\uFF5E\u2019\uFF04\u2019\uFF05\uFF03!!!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> Huh?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1AElisabeth:</strong> Huh?

Aren&#39;t I always like this? Haha, or maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;ve been staying up late lately.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Doctor, sorry I haven&#39;t been able to help you out even though we&#39;re in such a tense situation.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...That&#39;s suspicious...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Oh, what&#39;s wrong, Fujimaru?

I think it was...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Castle Csejte.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Yeah that&#39;s it! Got it? Time to head out!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Doctor!

It&#39;s almost Halloween!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It was supposed to be a cordial gathering, but last year&#39;s Death Concert is still haunting us!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai, it&#39;s too dangerous!

Dismissed!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Right!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I have only a bad feeling about this, so I&#39;m going to take a voluntary leave of absence!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> That&#39;s not going to work! All staff, scrum!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Once we save the world, I&#39;ll personally review your current salary!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It&#39;s time to show them the muscle you&#39;ve gained from training with Leonidas!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Th-That&#39;s not fair, Doctor!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fouuu!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Let&#39;s do it!

Now then, commence forced Rayshift!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> We&#39;re here...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, the Rayshift succeeded.

Anyway, how are things looking over there?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It looks like...a graveyard.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We can get back at the doctor later. Let&#39;s keep moving for now.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Sorry, Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> If I remember correctly, last year when we came here, there were ghosts all over the forest.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We&#39;re in a graveyard, but I don&#39;t see any ghosts.

Heeeeeey!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> L-Let&#39;s make a run for it, Master!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Wait! Hey, waaaaaiiit!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> She&#39;s chasing after us! Also, I think I just saw a familiar face!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Maybe that was just my imagination! But we don&#39;t have time for that!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Waaaaaiiiiit!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master! Master!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It was basic survival instinct that made us flee, but maybe we should at least listen to what she has to say!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Y-Yeah! It&#39;s bound to be one of the causes of this Singularity, after all!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Sorry, I just couldn&#39;t help it...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Last year&#39;s Halloween must be a great source of trauma for you, Master...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Mash is right, but...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No, I get it. Our feet just started moving of their own accord!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> You made me fall over! That hurt! Don&#39;t leave me behiiiiiiind!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master... I hear crying... from behind us...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Goodbye, eardrums...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Hello, Halloween...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Okay... Let&#39;s head back.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou! Fou, fou!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> What do you want? I have a broken heart, you know...

So you did hear me!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I&#39;m not happy about this at all!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> You made me so worried! You should be punished!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Is that you, Elisabeth...?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Have you forgotten!?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> It&#39;s me, the celebrated diva, praised as a talent that only comes once every thousand years, an unbridled genius!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Elisabeth the Crimson Hero!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou-bah!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Where&#39;s Lancerbeth and Casteli?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Why the nicknames!?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> ...They&#39;re not around anymore.

At this time of year?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s right. The swimsuit event is over, Elisabeth.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> What? Wait, you had a swimsuit event without me!? Where was my invite!?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> That&#39;s not fair! That&#39;s not fair at all!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Well, let&#39;s forget about that for now.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Let&#39;s not!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> I want to know precisely why no one called me!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I see. So dual Elisabeths were driven out of Castle Csejte by this queen.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Yeah, exactly. Now do you understand?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> The LanCas duo couldn&#39;t finish what they started. So now there&#39;s something I must do... For their sake.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> In other words, once more\u2013</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> That&#39;s right!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> That cursed pyramid has destroyed my concert hall!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> I&#39;m going to take it out and overthrow the queen within! That is the mission of the Crimson Hero Elisabeth!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So that&#39;s what&#39;s going to happen this time...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. I see. That&#39;s why there are tons of adventurers in the tavern.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Crimson Hero...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Fou&#39;s trying to say something, but it&#39;s best not to translate it.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> There she is! Surround her!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Oh? What&#39;s going on? This is...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Elisabeth, who are these people?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> The queen&#39;s lackeys! Be careful! They&#39;re all pretty strong!</p><p><strong>Queen&#39;s Knight:</strong> We are knights in the queen&#39;s service. We fight to purge Halloween.</p><p><strong>Queen&#39;s Knight:</strong> Those who speak of or desire to bring back Halloween shall be exiled or sentenced to hard labor, without exception!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s terrible...!</p><p><strong>Queen&#39;s Knight:</strong> And we also received a complaint that this girl over here... is, um... not wearing appropriate attire in public...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> That&#39;s not true! I&#39;m quite obviously dressed as a hero! ...Wait, I am, right!?</p><p><strong>Queen&#39;s Knight:</strong> (Ahem)</p><p><strong>Queen&#39;s Knight:</strong> In any event, it&#39;s exile or hard labor.

We&#39;re going to fight!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Wait.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Can you at least tell us why Halloween was banned?</p><p><strong>Queen&#39;s Knight:</strong> Because, uh... Because the queen ordered it!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Then we&#39;d like to ask the queen why.</p><p><strong>Queen&#39;s Knight:</strong> The world&#39;s most lovely queen will not hold an audience with the likes of you!</p><p><strong>Queen&#39;s Knight:</strong> Sorry, but we&#39;re going to restrain you!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Like hell you are!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> If you&#39;re going to stand in the way of my concerts and everything I stand for...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> ...I don&#39;t care who you are. I&#39;ll use every ounce of my strength to defeat you!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Looks like there&#39;s no way around it. Let&#39;s go, Master!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> By the way... Do you keep seeing someone lurking around here?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Queen&#39;s Knight:</strong> W-We&#39;ve failed...! Retreat! Retreat!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We sent them running, but... they were all quite skilled.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A queen adored by knights of such caliber... I wonder what she&#39;s like.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> We&#39;ll probably need to meet her if we&#39;re going to repair the Singularity.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Now, [\u2642 Puppy /\u2640 Deerlet], you&#39;re going to help me, right!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Fujimaru has joined the party!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> ...Th-Thank goodness...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Thank you...

Fast much!?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> ...Whatever. Anyway...!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> The legend of the Crimson Hero Elisabeth is going to start right here! That witch needs to brace herself!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Crimson Hero Elisabeth&#39;s Adventure has begun!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So why were you in the tavern with that sign?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Oh, that? All I did was say this to the owner lady:</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> \u201CNow then! I&#39;m looking for some strong, radiant companions! Ones who will put me in the spotlight and worship me!\u201D</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> \u201CI&#39;ll be on vocals. I&#39;ve never been in a band before. Looking for pros on guitar, bass, and drums.\u201D</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> When I did, she smiled and just handed the sign to me! Isn&#39;t that mean!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I guess it serves you right...</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong> Your Majesty, we have confirmed visitors from Chaldea. It seems they were caught in the Bounded Field that was put up.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Ha! Oh, I am so perfect, I predicted all of this! I of course have countermeasures in place!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> With the ultimate gatekeeper on watch, my superiority cannot be challenged... Oh, it&#39;s too beautiful...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I rule this land appropriately, with tolerance and ruthlessness.</p><p><strong>Queen&#39;s Knight:</strong> I-If I may, Your Majesty... Will Halloween continue to be banned?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Dunce! How about going to a salon and cleaning up your dull look first!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> It&#39;s too soon for the common fools to celebrate Halloween!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Holding such a lighthearted festival when the world is in such an unstable state? Pure idiocy!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Endure with patience, and keep love within your heart! Follow in my footsteps!</p><p><strong>Queen&#39;s Knight:</strong> ...But everyone was looking forward to Halloween... My children, too...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Blasphemy! Backtalk is punishable by death! But, for the sake of your children, I shall give you a day off. With remuneration!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Lay down your sword and return to your pitiful family at once! That is, if you value your life!</p><p><strong>Queen&#39;s Knight:</strong> Er, Your Majesty? I, uh, I don&#39;t quite follow...</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong> Just go home. It means you have tomorrow off.</p><p><strong>Queen&#39;s Knight:</strong> ...Understood. Then with all due respect, I shall receive your punishment of...paid leave.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong> Now then, my queen. What would you have us do?</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong> Shall we take them on now so we don&#39;t have to worry about them later?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! You fool!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> If we did that, it&#39;d be like I was afraid of them for some reason!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I&#39;m sending the knights into town. It&#39;ll prevent the citizens from becoming restless.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> As for you two... Well, there&#39;s no need for you to be deployed.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I know you&#39;re planning on hitting on the local girls the second I send you there. Sorry, but things don&#39;t always go your way!</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong> ...No, that&#39;s not what I...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Unbelievable... She sees through our very way of life...</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong> No, Lord Tristan. I really just care about the safety of the town.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> ...I hear there&#39;s a girl with a broken heart at one of the taverns. Apparently her man left her after losing his entire fortune on a bet the other day.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong> Which tavern is that? You mean that cute girl from Ash Tree Tavern on 3rd?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Ohoho. Maybe you would like to wait in prison instead of your own rooms?</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong> Excuse us. We will remain on standby, Your Majesty.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong> Then we shall take our leave. Please get some rest, my queen.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I will, of course. Now leave immediately!</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong> Yes, Your Majesty. ...Tristan?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...?</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> ... (Snoring)</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> ...How sad.

But I think there&#39;s an even more pressing issue at hand...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Umm... So you&#39;d like a Caster as well?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Yep, yep! And a cleric type would be good too. One who can use their cure magic for healing!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Healing, huh...</p><p><strong>Nurse:</strong> ...Now then, let&#39;s begin the treatment.</p><p><strong>Nurse:</strong> This is to save you. You will have to endure one or two broken bones, and maybe the loss of an arm or two. Or three.</p><p><strong>Nurse:</strong> Okay, here I go!</p><p><strong>Monk:</strong> Hm? Healing? You don&#39;t need that yet. We can self-heal through adrenaline and endorphins alone!</p><p><strong>Monk:</strong> Come now, don&#39;t cry. Pull yourself together.

Yeah, yeah, sorry about that.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> The outskirts of town have been dangerous lately. Pests and werebeasts have been lurking about.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> Probably because it&#39;s almost Halloween.

I get all anxious.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Are you sure that&#39;s the werebeasts&#39; fault? Is it not just that you need traps around to feel at ease?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> The latter, of course. A free safe haven doesn&#39;t feel right. Safety is maintained through hard work and money.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;re pretty cautious.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> Yep, I&#39;m a cautious guy. Only the humble survive in the forest.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> I&#39;m naturally a coward. I&#39;m scared to see my enemy&#39;s face straight on.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Is that why you take them down from the shadows? You&#39;re actually an Assassin, aren&#39;t you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Werebeasts...</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> Yeah, beasts typically don&#39;t go near human territory. They&#39;re careful, after all.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> But they&#39;ve gotten so close. We&#39;re in a perilous situation here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It does seem that it is unusually dangerous here. I bet that pyramid is the main culprit.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> That&#39;s right, Mash! Nicely done!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> That pyramid is the cause of everything! I&#39;m sure something can be done if we travel there!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> You think so?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> To be honest, the werebeasts started showing up way before the pyramid\u2014</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> Hey, looks like someone else got caught in the trap.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> If you&#39;re going to take on the pyramid, I don&#39;t mind lending a hand. That queen&#39;s brazen attitude is just too much for me.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> I was just thinking that she could use a little punishment.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Thank you very much! Elisabeth, we got ourselves a scout!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Scout? You mean someone who looks for potential idols!?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> ...But I don&#39;t feel like joining an agency yet...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> What should I do...?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> Considering you&#39;re a ruler, I really think you should stop daydreaming like that, you know?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Sh-Shut up. Anyway, let&#39;s take out those werebeasts!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> [\u2642 Puppy /\u2640 Deerlet], Mash, Robin... Follow me!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> I can&#39;t have dirty werebeasts attacking my town!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Robin, what&#39;s wrong?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> Oh, nothing. Just thinking about how the apple doesn&#39;t fall far from the tree, so to speak...</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> That dragon girl has no other plan but to rush in. We&#39;ll just have to support her, won&#39;t we?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> There you are! Hahaha. Something really did get caught!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> You look stupid hanging upside down like that!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Elisabeth! You should think about what happened to you a few minutes ago!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> I decided to stay positive, and keep anything that happened in the past locked away in my heart!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> Well how about you examine some of those things tucked away in your heart, huh?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Yeah, I couldn&#39;t forget them even if I wanted to!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Anyway, Green! You&#39;re joining us once we take them out!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> Sure. Once we get rid of all of them, there&#39;s no reason for me to stay in this forest anyway.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> This is totally going to be a pain, but I guess I have to. I&#39;ll join you on your Death Tour!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> It&#39;s not a \u201CDeath Tour\u201D! It&#39;s a curing, shiny concert tour!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Alright, the scout will now scout for us!

Well, that&#39;s fine.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> I do know someone, but... um...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Is there a problem?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Is it because they have gone insane, or that they build miniature gardens, or that they&#39;re fighting between AC and DC, or that they summon a flying saucer...?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> ...Well, those would be problems, yeah... It&#39;s just, she&#39;s a lot like someone we know.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> A lot like who?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> (Points silently)</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Me?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> (Gasp!)

Who is this mage you&#39;re talking about, and how is she like Elisabeth?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> They&#39;re practically one and the same. She&#39;s just a bit more intelligent.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> She&#39;s a bright one, but she&#39;s narrow-minded. Arrogant. Bossy. Fairly serious, but with a low boiling point.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> She jumps to conclusions and goes out of control, leading to disastrous consequences. It&#39;s all very painful to watch.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Foou...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> What? That&#39;s not like me at all.</p><p><strong>Both:</strong> It&#39;s just like you.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> (Gulp)</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> She&#39;s a pharaoh, and a queen, as well as a self-proclaimed god of the sky and the underworld.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> What? Don&#39;t you think that&#39;s too much description? Only idols of little talent have that many traits.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Noblewoman, vampire, serial killer, bat wings, dragon horns, idol, dragon girl.

Begone, impudent ones!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fooou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> S-So sudden!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Waaaaah!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> Calm down! It&#39;s an illusion. An illusion!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> Hey there, Your Majesty.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong> May King, you must be mad to bring them here.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong> We made a pact to protect one another&#39;s territory.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> Firstly, stop calling me that. It&#39;s embarrassing.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> And secondly, what&#39;s your deal?

That&#39;s good.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Both:</strong> TELL ME YOUR NAME!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> When these two start talking, I get the feeling it will never end, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Introduce yourselves!

Yes, name.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> My name is Nitocris. I am a pharaoh from a distant land.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> The god of the underworld, and the incarnation of the sky god Horus.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> And now, I study magecraft while I frolic with my phantoms in a deep cave.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> My name is Elisabeth B\xE1thory. As you can see, I&#39;m an idol.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> My specialty is idol pop, I suppose. An since I have draconic blood, naturally I also have a breath attack!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> And I&#39;m also a distinguished noble. And these wings and horns? Cute, aren&#39;t they? Anything else?</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> I see. Now we understand each other well.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> That&#39;s right.

It&#39;s time to duel! I&#39;ll smash your face in with my holy sword!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> Fine! I&#39;ll teach you and your 80s style who&#39;s really the boss!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> That armor is just old! I can&#39;t say exactly what&#39;s old about it, but it&#39;s very old!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> What? You don&#39;t even know that retro style is the new trend!? What a dummy!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> The only thing retro we need around here is Egypt! You moron!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong></p><p>RAAARRGGH!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong></p><p>HISSSSSS!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master, I don&#39;t understand what&#39;s going on.

Come on, [\u2642 Puppy /\u2640 Deerlet]!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I got it, so let go of my hand!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> We&#39;re through! Let&#39;s keep going!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> My throat&#39;s all warmed up now!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> Tch, I can hear those evil sound waves all the way here.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> It&#39;s like the wails of the dead from the underworld! Honestly, it&#39;s a genre I like!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> Idol pop... I guess I can&#39;t take it lightly!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> What do you mean by wails of the dead!?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> The motto of idol pop is \u201CCute, Cuter, Cutest,\u201D you know!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> But I&#39;m not done yet! ...Sphinx! Come on out!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What!?</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> Heheh. It costs a lot to rent, but this sphinx is the true guardian of my cavern.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> Pharaoh Ozymandias may not look it, but he runs a very honest business...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> \u201COh, you want to borrow my army of holy beasts? Then the rental fee is three scarabs a week.\u201D</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> \u201CIf you want a Marika Sphinx, add in 10 chains. Also, make sure its stomach is full when you bring it back.\u201D</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> He gave me those very reasonable terms! Now, get them!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Tch! Even I can tell... That thing is really powerful!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> But don&#39;t worry, [\u2642 Puppy /\u2640 Deerlet]. I will win. You know why?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Not a clue...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Heheh, so even my little [\u2642 Puppy /\u2640 Deerlet] doesn&#39;t know? Then I&#39;ll tell you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Because you&#39;re strong?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Close. But might doesn&#39;t always make right.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> It&#39;s because I&#39;m a hero. In other words, the good guy always wins!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Now do you get it, [\u2642 Puppy /\u2640 Deerlet]?</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> ...That&#39;s strange. My pharaoh-vision shows your original alignment as Chaotic-Evil...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Sh-Sh-Shut up! Bring it, you hag!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> ...That was surprisingly easy!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> Th-That&#39;s strange! There&#39;s no way my guardian sphinx is this weak!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Maybe it&#39;s not in its natural habitat?</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> That&#39;s it! How foolish! I should&#39;ve brought a heater!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It seemed tired.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> (GASP!) It must have been tired from its long journey from Egypt...!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> And it probably couldn&#39;t adapt to the environment either! How foolish of me!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Now we finally meet!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> So you made it through all my challenges, and now here you are at last.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> I shall praise you for that! But this is the end of the line!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> Why? Because I&#39;m splendidly strong! I&#39;ve been cooped up in my room perfecting my magecraft!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> ...Unbelievable. She&#39;s bragging about being a shut-in!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Wait, are you okay? I really hate dark and cramped places.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> Me too! But this is the underworld right now! If I want to enhance my dark pharaoh power, this is the only place!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> To be honest, the Western underworld is just too damaging.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> The Egyptian underworld is vast, comfortable, and dry... Why do you people view death as a negative thing?</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> Rather, why do you have to punish souls who have already lost their bodies? Does your god actually hate humans?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> ...Listen to you. You&#39;re pretty cynical. You look pretty sporty, but you&#39;re actually just another bookworm.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> Book...worm? No, I study curses, see...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> I wrote messages as a pharaoh, but most of what I wrote were spells and curses...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> So you&#39;re a bass player!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> The person that works hard to set the tone of the band from behind the scenes and carve an oppressive sound into the audience!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> But the sound is usually hidden under the melody of the guitar. The guitar plays the melody, the bass lays down the rhythm...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Oh, it&#39;s so sad! The bassist is lonely, but their job is the most rock n&#39; roll of them all! That&#39;s what I think!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> You must&#39;ve endured a lot, despite your demeanor!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> I don&#39;t really know what you mean by bassist, but I appreciate your noticing that!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> And I can see you struggle a lot, too! Just look at how hard the people around you struggle!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Yes, of course! Wait... Was that a compliment?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Of course.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Right!? Zebra stripes says some good things, despite being our enemy!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That&#39;s Nitocris for you... She&#39;s just a little off...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Yeah. She has the insight to understand a situation in a single moment, but her conclusions always seem to miss the mark...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> I accept it. That woman is a tough foe! That&#39;s why I won&#39;t use any tricks. I&#39;ll fight her head-on!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> Haha, bring it on. If it weren&#39;t for this situation, I&#39;m sure we&#39;d\u2014</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Yes, I&#39;m sure we could&#39;ve been friends...! But that future will never happen.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> It&#39;s sad to say it, but you&#39;re right. Now let&#39;s fight...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Are you sure you guys aren&#39;t actually getting along...?</p><p><strong>Both:</strong> 100% SURE!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> Heh... Not bad... I&#39;ve run out of my hardworking phantoms...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> You&#39;re not so bad yourself. Those were some amazing moves... Also, those phantoms are cute.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Especially the ones with the sheets on their heads. The ones that go in circles.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> I feel like they could give me some useful ideas for my concert!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> So you noticed my Medjeds... I guess you&#39;re not just a harmful beast after all.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> Your songs really were wonderful... The phantoms were all applauding...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> And so was I... It felt so good that I was inspired spiritually.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Huh?</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> It&#39;s true that the pyramid has been in the back of my mind. As pharaoh, I figured I needed to \u201Csay hello\u201D...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> But I didn&#39;t think it was right to take them on alone, so I stayed here in my little abode.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> ...Very well, Crimson Hero Elisabeth. I will help you with your concert.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Thank you. I have a feeling we will become good friends.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (Panting) We&#39;ve finally caught up... Huh?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> A-A handshake? Not a fight?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um... Master? What happened?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I knew they&#39;d be friends.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> ...But if two troublemakers become friends, that just means an exponential increase in problems for us...</p><p><strong>Both:</strong> WHAT DID YOU SAY!?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Anyway, let&#39;s get going! Our goal is to reach Pyramid Csejte!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Our next stop takes us through the Glacier Zone!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Glaciers!?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> ...Now that I think about it, yes, it&#39;s weird to have something like that on the way to a castle...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I think it&#39;s a staple for these type of adventures.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...Hm? I&#39;m seeing one, two, three, four... five Servant responses...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> There&#39;s one too many of you!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> ...Humph. There&#39;s an un-candy lack of candy around here... And no, that wasn&#39;t meant to be a joke.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> What&#39;s going on, Fujimaru? You didn&#39;t lie to me, did you!?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> I thought Halloween was supposed to be this wonderful festival where you can eat all the candy you want!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What are you doing here?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> Idiot! I&#39;ve been here the whole time! You just failed to notice me!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> How long have you been here?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> Fwahahaha! I Rayshifted here with you!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So I wasn&#39;t seeing things...! Thank goodness!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Huh? Who are you? I don&#39;t want a Jester joining my party!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> Who are you calling a Jester!? I&#39;m not some drunk Kyoto commoner!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Looks like the next episode will still be chaotic!</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> ...Humph.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> Hahahaha! What a boring book this is! Though it is killing time, I guess...</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> You there! The sleeping pig!</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Yes ma&#39;am. Sleeping pig Tristan, at your service.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> I don&#39;t like that music. Play something else.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Then what about this?</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> Stop it, you&#39;re driving me crazy! I can&#39;t read my book in peace!</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> I thought a more upbeat tune would be better...</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> There are limits to how far you can go! Limits!</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> And night has fallen. Loud noises are unrefined.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> And actually, how did you play that sound with a harp?</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong> Excuse me, my queen.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> What do you want? I&#39;m going to bed. If you have something to report, tell me tomorrow\u2014</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong> Pharaoh-You-Know-Who has joined the party from Chaldea.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> WH...</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong></p><p>WHAT DID YOU SAY!?</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> The pharaoh aligned herself with that stupid, foolish girl who lacks even a shred of intelligence!?</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> How sad! Our queen&#39;s face is twisted in sorrow...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> ...but even then it is still radiantly beautiful...</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> With her involved, they will even break through the Lava Zone, not to mention the Glacier Zone...</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong> What shall we do, my queen?</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> It seems an idiot can exceed one&#39;s expectations.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> This is difficult... Humph...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> The worried look on Your Majesty&#39;s face is beautiful too\u2014</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> I&#39;m trying to think, and there you are getting in the way. Go jump out a window.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Oh... I can fly...!</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong> He really jumped...!</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong> He&#39;s using sound waves to fly...</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> Of course he can fly! Haven&#39;t you heard of the Tristan thrush? Anyway, Sir Lances-A-Lot-Of-Married-Women...</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong> Yes, Your Majesty... I mean, what!?</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> I&#39;m deploying those girls to the Lava Zone. Hold them back no matter the cost.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong> Wh-What...? But those girls are far too dangerous.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong> They might get out of control. No, I mean they will! I&#39;m sure of it!</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> Hahahaha! It&#39;ll be fine! Why? Because it&#39;s me doing it!</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong> (That worries me...)</p><h2 id="section-5-it-s-frozen-so-let-it-go" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-5-it-s-frozen-so-let-it-go" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 5: &quot;It&#39;s Frozen, So Let It Go&quot;</h2><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> There&#39;s no need to introduce myself!

This is not my intention!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> Humans are the ones who offer me sweets to save their lives!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> Meat is a better choice than sweets when you get hungry. Then again, after becoming a Servant, I am never hungry!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> So I&#39;ll let them live in exchange for this unsubstantial offering of sweets, but just this once. Welp, I feel like I&#39;m going to melt!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I see. Intentions aside, your true feelings are totally showing.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> But once you step out of town, what the heck is going on!? Treat! Treat! Treeeaaat!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> I keep yelling the password, but no one shows up! Ah! Oh no! I&#39;m getting sugar withdrawal symptoms...!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> I need something to munch on! Something sugary! Something tough!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> But if you don&#39;t have anything like that, one of those Evil Bones you always have stocked up will do!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Oh hell no! Anything but an Evil Bone!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> Then candy! Marshmallows would be fine, too!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> Come to think of it, running around in the cold is making me crave something with calories in it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What about Mash!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> S-Senpai!?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> Mmm, she looks soft but not sweet! Rejected!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I don&#39;t have any more!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Hahaha. That&#39;s because we used a lot on Caster Elisabeth.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> What...did you just say!?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong></p><p>So... no more sweets? All gone?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> But I still haven&#39;t had my favorite\u2013this thing you call \u201Cchocolate\u201D!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s the way the cookie crumbles...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> Grrr, grrr, hahahaha! ...I&#39;m going home...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> I&#39;m going back to the mountain!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> P-Please, wait, Ibaraki! I&#39;ll give you sweets when we get back to Chaldea!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Our meeting up here must be fate. Please, won&#39;t you help us?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> Bwahahaha!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> Nonsense. A human seeking help from an oni is the height of absurdity!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You&#39;re right, but...</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> ... (Rustle, rustle)</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> In the first place, I only came here for fun. I am what you could call a visitor from out of town, and yet you ask for my help to\u2013Mmmpph!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Hmm?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong></p><p>Ohhh... Ooooooohhh!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> Whoops, silly me, throwing chocolate around like that! I was saving that for the kids in town...</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> Although I suppose this works in a Japanese sense. Don&#39;t people there yell \u201COni out, luck in!\u201D while throwing food?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong></p><p>This is... choco... chocolate...! It&#39;s sweet as hell... and sweet as hell to boot!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> This oni here isn&#39;t good at expressing herself.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> But it won&#39;t work. Just a measly piece of chocolate won&#39;t work on me at all! It won&#39;t work...!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> She&#39;s gritting her teeth through a torrent of tears... Her lament is making me choke up...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> Yaaa! What&#39;s wrong, good man in green!? Aren&#39;t you going to attack me more!? Come on, come on!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> Like the time at Rashomon! Just like at Rashomon!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> Well, I wish I could give you more, but...</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> Uh-oh, something&#39;s coming. This is no time to be throwing chocolate around.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong></p><p>Hahahahaha, this infuriates me even more! Scum! Get out of here. I&#39;ll rip you from limb to limb!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> M-Moving to battle formation! Whenever you&#39;re ready, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> Green man! Green good tidings, green pilgrim, green hermit, green geezer!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> As you can see, the pests are gone! So come on! Pretend it&#39;s Setsubun and throw me some sweets!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> All right, all right. I suppose you deserve it. But call me a geezer again and you can kiss chocolate goodbye.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> Mmm. Understood. I&#39;m clever in that area. But... Mmm. Mmm-mmm-mmm.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> We got rid of those enemies as quickly as the chocolates melting in my mouth.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> Even this delicious chocolate isn&#39;t enough to keep me here. This place isn&#39;t worthy anymore! You heard me!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> Farewell! Farewell!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> Oh really? I was going to say... If you can defeat the queen living in that pyramid, you&#39;ll have all the sweets you can eat. Too bad.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> I knew that pyramid was trouble. When do we leave?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Ibaraki...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Hmm. She&#39;s an unexpected addition to our party, but Ibaraki-Douji&#39;s strength is the real deal. Besides...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Besides what, Doctor?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I think it&#39;s a good thing she&#39;s showing an interest in human culture.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Even if her underlying aggression towards humans can&#39;t be changed, having a favorite food in common with us is a positive thing.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, certainly. I think that leads to mutual understanding.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Yeah. So, Fujimaru, I know it&#39;ll be tough, but please look after her.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Sure, I&#39;ll do my best!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> She&#39;s perfectly tame now.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> So where do we go from here?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Next is... the Lava Zone! ...But why is there lava...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> L-Let&#39;s just go.

You should refer to me as \u201Cuncle\u201D when I&#39;m summoned as king.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> I told you before. Each different aspect of a particular hero manifests as its own distinct Servant.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Like what has happened with me here, now.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> But, but even so... you&#39;re still Uncle Vlad.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> ...Even though you may hate me.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Even though I may have done things that are unforgivable.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> You have indeed. You committed a sin... though the world may not consider it that way.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> That sin is not even engraved upon your Spirit Origin. After all, that world has been forgotten.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> ...But I shall never forget.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> You denied the final integrity of my light, my wife, my love.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> For her sake, I will not forgive you. Even if she herself may have...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Elisabeth...</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> ...I see. I somewhat recall it too. Man, humanity being in a state of flux is a nuisance.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> That Vlad III and Elisabeth had a bit of a history together.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> This isn&#39;t about who&#39;s right and who&#39;s wrong.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> The World isn&#39;t concerned by human values like virtue. It will just adopt whatever means are useful to guarantee the continuation of its existence.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> Whether it&#39;s a young lady who tries to atone for her grave sins, even if she knows no shame...</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> ...or the conviction of a gentleman who won&#39;t accept any kind of atonement, but just seeks to punish every evil act... The World considers them equally sinful.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...Right. They&#39;re the same, so it will choose the one that&#39;s more effective\u2013even someone evil, if it means preserving humanity.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> If humanity&#39;s preservation isn&#39;t wished for, they won&#39;t be allowed to be summoned as a Heroic Spirit. Even if they stand for righteousness.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> But if that&#39;s the case, it means even Vlad III wishes for the preservation of humanity.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> After all, he was summoned as a Servant this time.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> ...I think you&#39;re right. I hate humans. I don&#39;t like them and I don&#39;t trust them.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> That being said, I have no intention of destroying their world. After all, humans are useful for a number of things.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> I exist because humans, my enemies, exist. In a world without humans, neither Shuten nor I would be summoned.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> Isn&#39;t that true, Red Horns? No matter how many sins you&#39;ve committed...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> No one can reject your being here right now. As long as you don&#39;t wish for \u201Cnothingness,\u201D you&#39;ll be a Heroic Spirit like the rest of us.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> Of course, as an Anti-Hero... A sacrifice whose role is to lose to the Heroic Spirits.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> ...You&#39;re right. Thanks, Ibaraki. I&#39;m grateful.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Now then...

Were my countermeasures too flimsy!?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> No, no, calm down. Calm down. Everyone makes mistakes. I&#39;m no exception.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Rather, a beautiful queen is the only one allowed to make careless mistakes. Paradoxically, those mistakes are what make her a queen in the first place!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Yes, that&#39;s right. That proves I&#39;m not at fault here.

She really is a queen, right?</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> Because I&#39;ll be forced to surrender if it turns out to be some extravagant man with eyes like the sun and a beautiful voice...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Don&#39;t worry. She&#39;s a woman for sure. Just her true nature is different.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> I may be a dragon, but she&#39;s a snake\u2013a fiercely venomous one at that!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong> I see you haven&#39;t learned anything from your two defeats.

You look stronger than before!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Heh, for you to notice that... That&#39;s some observation you got there.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Yes, I was born once more through a Palingenesis-like process from the humiliation of having everything taken from me, and my own self-denial...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> I am the muscle-based idol that has become a Saber-class Servant, Elisabeth B\xE1thory (Brave)!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Oh I get it now...!

Or you need fervor!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong> That reason may be that you&#39;re as beautiful as the heavens. It could be that you wield power, even though you&#39;re hideous.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Oh, that stings...

Only the B\xE1thory part is right!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong> Now that you mention it, you&#39;re right, but who cares about the small things! We&#39;re having an important discussion right now!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> That&#39;s my line!

You mean that Paris Fashion Week girl is Queen Cleopatra...!?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Ohohohoho. Even a girl with the bare minimum of nobility like you knows my name.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Then I shall ask again. Can you compete against my beauty?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> ...This is bad. When it comes to whose Heroic Spirit is more beautiful, she has the upper hand...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> No matter how you look at it, my style is more modern, but I can&#39;t beat her brand reputation...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Modern?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Style?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> What, are you saying my bikini armor is old-school!? It&#39;s totally modern! Right!?</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> Yes, I think that outfit is good. It would make perfect sense in Ancient Egypt.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> I know, right? Finally somebody from Egypt gets me!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> To me you both look the sa\u2014No, never mind.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> But, well, in terms of looking dignified, the queen over there is on a different level. Her self-confidence has no limits.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> I don&#39;t know what to say. My standards of beauty are different from humans&#39; to begin with.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> That being said... Hahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> Master! Master! She has an ulterior motive, and a malicious one at that.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> Like she&#39;ll bite you or tear you up if you get close. Well, I guess for a demon, that&#39;s pretty beautiful!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Hmm... You&#39;re not human, huh? Then it makes sense you can&#39;t understand me.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> And also...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> You...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> Quiet, Cleopatra. I simply ended up on this side by chance this time.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> I am just a normal Caster, a mage. You just need to live up to your beliefs without wavering.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> ...Yes.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> So, Elisabeth, let me ask you again. Do you intend to compete with my beauty?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Ha...hahahaha! Ohohoho! No way, that would be impossible! That&#39;s not even a contest!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> If you&#39;re a woman, then you know there&#39;s nothing more terrifying than being judged based on your beauty!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> I am the world-renowned Cleopatra! That contest would only make you lose face...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Huh? I can compete.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> ...What was that?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> It&#39;s true that if we&#39;re just talking how our bodies look, my physical age might put me at a very slight disadvantage...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> In any event, diversification is in right now. There are more standards of beauty now than there were in the past. Espeeeeecially...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Yes! What about cuteness? I sing, dance, and smile for my pig fans!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> That&#39;s something only an idol like me can do! And something a queen, who is served on every day, cannot!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> In other words, you&#39;re not someone that rules over others...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> That&#39;s right! Your Majesty, I challenge you to a duel! As an idol!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Oh, and of course I&#39;ll take up the reins of government. An idol can rule just fine.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> How dare you... How dare you... You have no idea how mad your proposal makes me...!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Beauty is born from intelligence. Thus, ruling is carried out through beauty...!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Ruling over the masses merely because you&#39;re \u201Ccute\u201D... As a queen, I won&#39;t allow such happy-go-lucky attitudes!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (I kind of get why Cleopatra is mad...)</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> (No, Elisabeth is just that selfish. After all, she&#39;s an Anti-Hero...someone who&#39;s been making mistakes her whole life.)</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> I&#39;m an idol, and the mistress of Castle Csejte!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Servants get summoned as Lancers, Casters, and so on, right?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Just like Uncle Vlad accepted me for who I am and didn&#39;t forgive me\u2014</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> I&#39;m greedy, prideful, and selfish. That&#39;s why both versions of me are important!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> I won&#39;t give up on either one!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> So you&#39;re not going to give up...on either of you? This is why regional rulers are so annoying...!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Very well, we&#39;ll see just how long you can keep that attitude. I&#39;ll test you!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> ...At the end of the day, you&#39;re just spouting nonsense! Drown in the beauty of Cleopatra...and die!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> ...Splendid. This is different than before. A complete defeat...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Ha... Excellent. Truly excellent. A splended defeat is quite exhilarating.</p><p><strong>Mysterious Black Knight:</strong> (I&#39;m not sure about that... I feel like we fought for nothing...!)</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> ...I can&#39;t believe it. I didn&#39;t think I would lose...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> The match is over! You&#39;re going to give me back Castle Csejte!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> And do something about this pyramid! Actually, don&#39;t bring this kind of stuff in here!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> ...That&#39;s... kind of difficult...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> What?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> ...Well, I&#39;m not the one who brought this pyramid here.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Then who dropped this annoying thing on my castle?!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Well...</p><p><strong>G\uFF1A???:</strong> IT WAS ME!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Who are you!?</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> Th-That voice...!?</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> It can&#39;t be?! It couldn&#39;t, could it!?</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong> If you want to know who I am, I shall answer. I am Ozymandias, the king who rules the sun!!</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong> Hahahaha! Cleopatra! They&#39;ve completely crushed you!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> H-How embarrassing! As someone who holds the name of pharaoh, I have fallen hard...!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> I cannot bear any additional embarrassment. Please sever my head!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> I don&#39;t want you making a bloody mess here! We&#39;re going to decorate for Halloween!</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong> Yes. Just as that thin girl over there says. We need to decorate this castle now.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong> Your blood would ruin the festival. Your punishment will be to sit there and take your shame!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Yes, Your Majesty!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Ozymandias... In other words, Ramesses II! To think someone so important would show up in this weird Singularity...!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It&#39;s like an adult showing up to a kid&#39;s event, you know!?</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong> Adults have fun, too. Grown-ups enjoy this kind of levity!</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong> But that&#39;s why you should not worry. I will not fight.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong> Cleopatra was ruling over this pyramid, and was defeated by you.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> I would have never thought Your Majesty... If you had given me word... I wouldn&#39;t have joined their side...</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong> Heh. Don&#39;t say that, Nitocris. I told Cleopatra to keep her mouth shut.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> I-I&#39;m not displeased at all! My apologies for slipping my tongue!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> ...Umm, I&#39;m not really following what you guys are saying. Why are people from Egypt here?</p><p><strong>Both:</strong> HOW DISRESPECTFUL!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Whyaun!?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> I can&#39;t help it! I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m being disrespectful! I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> That&#39;s right. You guys really have no connection to this place whatsoever, so why are you here?</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong> Umph, No Face King of the Forest.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong> ...Very well. It&#39;s no fun just seeing you all rack your brains.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong> Then I shall ask you. Does anyone know the final moments of this woman, Cleopatra?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Y-Yes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> They say she committed suicide after her husband Antonius, general of the Roman army...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...lost to Augustus in the naval battle of Actium and later died.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong> That&#39;s right. The Ptolemaic Kingdom quickly collapsed and the country disappeared.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong> Leaving her as the last pharaoh.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong> And thus, she has avoided wishing for anything, and refused to be summoned as a Servant until now.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...What do you mean?</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong> She has a personal desire.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong> And it&#39;s something that won&#39;t come true unless she participates in a Holy Grail War as a Servant.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong> But it&#39;s not a wish as a pharaoh. It&#39;s a selfish desire you could find anywhere on the streets.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong> She feels so responsible for the destruction of her country that she has locked it away in her heart.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong> Thinking that someone that has done what she did should not be allowed to have a wish!</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong> But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s something to be suffering over for a thousand or so years, so I gave her an opportunity.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong> To rule this upside-down pyramid as queen...</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong> ...Until Halloween ends.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong> And had she done that, I would have granted her wish with the Holy Grail I was given.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A Holy Grail...!?</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong> And then you lost. You have no objections. Right, Cleopatra?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> ...Correct.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> I realized that it&#39;s wrong for someone like me to hope for something.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong> I see, and so you&#39;re going to suppress that wish and turn your back on it for the rest of eternity, then!?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> That is the least I can do to atone for destroying my country.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong> ...Heh.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> ?</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong> Hahahahaha! Hahahahahahaha!! That&#39;s your answer!?</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong> Ridiculous! Anubis would be holding his belly laughing, I imagine! Did you hear that, thin girl?!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> I told you to call me Elisabeth! Or if you want to be more friendly, Elly is also good!</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong> Huh. I see. In that case, Elly, or whatever, if you have something to say, you should say it now!</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong> I appreciate that ridiculous arrogance of yours!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Did you just say Elly!?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Then I&#39;ll say it.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Umm... You know, Cleopatra... You&#39;re an...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> IDIOT!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> What...!?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Didn&#39;t I tell you? That I would be both an idol and a ruler!?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> You can be a pha... pharaoh? and have a personal desire at the same time!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Take part in a bunch of Holy Grail Wars, and do your best to get it granted!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Why can&#39;t you do the things that I can do?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> You can do it right? I bet you could do it while you dance gracefully even.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> That&#39;s...!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> I don&#39;t want to say this, but...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> I got all excited about being an idol, I forgot about Halloween, so you might have ruled a bit... better, maybe.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> You can have your own personal desires!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> ...Are you sure... I don&#39;t know if I can\u2014</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> It&#39;s fine! You think so too, right [\u2642 Puppy /\u2640 Deerlet]?</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong> Humanity&#39;s final Master, Fujimaru! You look like you want to say something.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong> It&#39;s fine! Finish her off! Don&#39;t hold back and tell her!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You can be selfish.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Selfish...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> ...You&#39;re right. I&#39;ve wanted to be, this entire time.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You do you, Cleopatra.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Be...myself... You&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> That&#39;s what I&#39;ve been trying to be this whole time, but...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> At some point, all I could think about was being a pharaoh...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Sun King, Ozymandias. Incarnation of Horus, Queen Nitocris.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Please forgive me. From this day forth, I will accept myself for who I am, and not just be a pharaoh.</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> I forgive you. Become the strength needed for those that follow you. Act like the name you have carved into history.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong> I too grant forgiveness. Have the name of Cleopatra shine brightly, arrogantly, and proudly!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> ...Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> My name is Cleopatra VII. A former pharaoh.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> From this day forward, I will answer the summons as a Heroic Spirit and protect human history.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> When that happens, I will use this beautiful face, this voice, this body to be an Assassin class Servant.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> In other words... My glory is wasted on you. Give it up and resign yourself to it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;d welcome you any time!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Th-That was a good answer, Fujimaru! You&#39;ve been wonderful this far. Now you just need to rest!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> All right. Everything&#39;s good now!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> Mhh. So is everything done here? (Crunch, crunch)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ibaraki-Douji... Slow down when you eat. There will be plenty of candy once Halloween begins.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> I&#39;m not eating. I&#39;m not eating any candy.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> ...So what was that selfish wish, anyway?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Th-That...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> I&#39;ve never heard of your wish. Would you tell us, if you don&#39;t mind?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Yes, if that&#39;s what you want, Your Majesty. My wish... Well, I have several, but...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> I&#39;d like to see the man I loved one more time. I don&#39;t really want to get back together with him, but...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> I still remember...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> The day he whispered sweet nothings into my ear while holding me in his slender but strong arms...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> His chiseled features, his cheek bones ever so tempting... And he was so sincere...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Yes... I&#39;d like to see my Caesar again...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mysterious Black Knight:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> What happened? Has the last boss made their appearance?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Everyone, emergency huddle.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> This is bad. She&#39;s talking about THAT Caesar, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, Caesar, one of the three least trustworthy Servants in Chaldea, and almost always the mastermind behind everything.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...By the way, this is what Chaldea&#39;s Caesar looks like.</p><p><strong>Ozymandias:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Nitocris:</strong> Gahgh!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...They both passed out.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh no. It looks like King Ozymandias is holding his stomach and trying to hold back his laughter...</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong> Yeah, it&#39;s quite a shock to see Caesar for the first time...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Should we tell her the truth?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I don&#39;t think we should... We would be destroying her dream...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> ...But we should tell her someday.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> How sad... People change... They say aging isn&#39;t ugly, but...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> ...This goes beyond aging... Please forget this song...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> This is definitely a severe case of stress eating... Oh, how sad...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> I have only seen this level of stress in Agravain...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> You look like you&#39;re having fun over there! Let me join in too!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> And why are the great pharaohs collapsed on the floor like they had a sudden stomach ache or something!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> H-Hold on a second!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Huh? What&#39;s wrong? Did you call me? Want me to answer?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> W-Wait. Hold on! Don&#39;t just Rayshift without my permi\u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Doctor? Doctor...!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> H-He really did Rayshift...!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> This is bad! That means...!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> VENI!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> ...! This voice...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh... He really did come...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> VIDI!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> My Caesar...!? To think I can meet you again at last!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> I-I need a mirror. Does anyone have a mirror!?</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> Is my makeup running? We were just fighting after all! Is it okay? Is it okay!?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Now all I have to do is show myself!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> My Cae\u2014</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> IT IS I!</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> WHAT!?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Hahaha. It&#39;s been a while, Cleopatra. Hmm? I guess this is the first time meeting each other as Servants.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> ... (THUD)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yeah, I thought so...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> I guess she couldn&#39;t accept reality and escaped it by fainting...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> Humans are frail beings. They should just be positive as long as they have something to strive for.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, a Holy Grail fragment came out. I&#39;m going to collect it.</p><p><strong>Cleopatra:</strong> ...Uuugh... Round... I saw something round... Rolling... Rolling around... Uuuugh...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> ...I can&#39;t tell her to leave with the pyramid right now...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Let&#39;s have her rest here until her emotional scars heal.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Once Halloween starts, she might calm down a little bit too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, let&#39;s all have a very fun Halloween for her sake too!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Very well! So who should I trick\u2014I mean, persuade?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> I haven&#39;t made much of an appearance lately!
