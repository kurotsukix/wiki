Sam〇</h2><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> Ho ho ho. It&#39;s me, Santa.</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> I was all set to deliver presents to good boys and girls with my trusty sheep, Zerco, again...</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> ...but apparently no Santa can keep the job two years in a row, no matter how good they may be at it.</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> But, even if there will be no more Altera Santa, there will always be a Santa. This year, I think it should be you who takes up the mantle.</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> Ho ho ho. If you asked me to give you a reason for that, I would say it&#39;s because you and I are somewhat...similar?</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> I just have a sense that we share similar roots. Call it an Altera hunch.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Vaya! Bien! I have heard of this being who brings joy to all, yes!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> As the goddess of prosperity, it would be my pleasure to accept this honorable job, yes!</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> Hang on. You say you&#39;re a goddess? As in...deity?</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> (...Would this be a sign of me approving of Western values if I appoint her the next Santa...?)</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> ............(Well, I suppose gifts of raw liver would still count as presents...)</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> Yep, this should be fine. I think. I mean life is all about trying new things and taking opportunities as they arise... And Christmas should be no different.</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> Besides, one of the great things about Chaldea is that everyone gets a chance at being Santa, no matter who they might be.</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> Okay, now that I have completed my completely perfect explanation, go ahead and take the Christmas Grail.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Oh? What&#39;s this now?</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> It&#39;s a one-of-a-kind superitem that can bring to life all manner of fluffy, wonderful Christmasy things.</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> Don&#39;t ask me how I acquired it. I just looked down one day and there it was, in my hand.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Well, I don&#39;t know what all that&#39;s about, but it sounds lovely, yes! All right then, don&#39;t mind if I–</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> Oh my... This is...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Whoa, whoa! You there, the two A-rankers! What&#39;s with the weird signal we just detected from here!?</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> I&#39;ll admit that this didn&#39;t go quite as I thought, but never mind that. The important thing is that a new Santa has been born.</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> Take a look. This is this year&#39;s all-new Sa–</p><p><strong>E：Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Olé! Now I am the perfect one to spread happiness and joy everywhere! I should start dancing now, no?</p><p><strong>E：Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Let&#39;s try this! And some of this! Hmm, yes, yes! This should bring joy to all!</p><p><strong>E：Quetzalcoatl:</strong> And since this involves so much exercise, it should help me train my core for lucha as–</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> ...Quetzalcoatl.</p><p><strong>E：Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Sí?</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> That&#39;s a samba.</p><p><strong>E：Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Tope con Girooo!?</p><p><strong>E：Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Whoops! I guess I must have misheard you.</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> That&#39;s all right. These things happen.</p><p><strong>E：Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Hmm, now what do I do? My Spirit Origin has stabilized, so I can&#39;t change it again, no.</p><p><strong>E：Quetzalcoatl:</strong> But then again, maybe I don&#39;t have to! Who says I can&#39;t dance and deliver presents at the same time!?</p><p><strong>E：Quetzalcoatl:</strong> In fact, I bet that would make everyone even happier! Esto no es un problema!</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> True, Santa is more of a state of mind than a specific form. Changing up a letter or two shouldn&#39;t really make any difference.</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> In fact, for all we know, Santa and samba might even have the same etymology. What do you think, Da Vinci?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> No. No, they do not.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Still, I can&#39;t imagine a Divine Spirit of Quetzalcoatl&#39;s caliber buying into a different religion&#39;s customs, so I can&#39;t say I&#39;m shocked that her interpretation of this is so...um, unique.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That&#39;s not really why I&#39;m here though. About that signal I mentioned...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I have to say, it seemed way stronger than anything that going into...uh, Samba Mode should generate. Any idea what may have caused it?</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>E：Quetzalcoatl:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Oh yeah, you two definitely have more than an idea. What happened? Come on, out with it.</p><p><strong>A：Great Sheep Zerco:</strong> Baaa. (Allow me.)</p><p><strong>A：Great Sheep Zerco:</strong> Baaa. (I saw the whole tragedy unfold from the beginning. Who am I, you ask?)</p><p><strong>A：Great Sheep Zerco:</strong> Baaa. (I&#39;m Zerco.) Baaa. (Lady Altera&#39;s faithful sheep.)</p><p><strong>A：Great Sheep Zerco:</strong> Baaa. (Basically, Quetzalcoatl and the Christmas Grail were an exceptionally bad fit for each other.)</p><p><strong>A：Great Sheep Zerco:</strong> Baaa. (Their myths were...mismatched.) Babaaa. (A mythmatch, if you will.)</p><p><strong>E：Quetzalcoatl:</strong> No lo entiendo, pero what an observant little sheep, yes!</p><p><strong>E：Quetzalcoatl:</strong> I did not think there was a problem with the Grail, no! Not after I transformed like this!</p><p><strong>E：Quetzalcoatl:</strong> But...I will admit I was a little surprised by all the backlash.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Backlash?</p><p><strong>E：Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Sí. To put it simply...</p><p><strong>E：Quetzalcoatl:</strong> ...it feels like my power has been split in two, and as for where the other half could have gone... No sé!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> I did see a light flying off into the sunset earlier. I think that must have been Santa.</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> Also, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s with your other half or not, but I think the Christmas Grail disappeared somewhere, too.</p><p><strong>E：Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Oh no! Lo siento! I can&#39;t believe I lost it right after you gave it to me!</p><p><strong>E：Quetzalcoatl:</strong> But, if you think about it, Santa is all about giving presents, not getting them, yes?</p><p><strong>E：Quetzalcoatl:</strong> So it feels wrong for me to receive such a grand gift...</p><p><strong>E：Quetzalcoatl:</strong> ...especially since I have already obtained more than enough power to become Santa!</p><p><strong>E：Quetzalcoatl:</strong> So I&#39;m not going to worry about the rest of the Holy Grail power going off on its own, no!</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> Good point. The power is yours to do with as you wish. As long as Christmas is peaceful, I&#39;m a happy Santa.</p><p><strong>E：Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Sí. I might be half the goddess I once was, but I still shouldn&#39;t have any problem performing my duties as Santa.</p><p><strong>E：Quetzalcoatl:</strong> In fact, I think the part of me that flew off was the part that likes things a bit of rough-and-tumble, yes!</p><p><strong>E：Quetzalcoatl:</strong> So I think the peace-loving part of me should be able to handle being Santa just fine!</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> (Hmm. Now that I look more closely, I can see she&#39;s a Ruler.)</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> (Is that because the side of her that got her people to stop making human sacrifices is stronger now...?)</p><p><strong>E：Quetzalcoatl:</strong> I&#39;m sure the half that flew off will come back on its own once Christmas is over and I&#39;m back to normal.</p><p><strong>E：Quetzalcoatl:</strong> So don&#39;t you worry about a thing! I&#39;m going to be the best samba Santa there ever was, yes!</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> Ho ho ho. That&#39;s just what I like to hear.</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> Very well then, I look forward to seeing you in action. Merry Sambamas!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Whaaat?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> A mass of...sorta Holy Grail energy AND a being as strong as Quetzalcoatl are off to who knows where?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Oh yeah, nothing could possibly go wrong here...</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s Christmas season again, Senpai!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou fooou!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Looks like this year&#39;s Santa isn&#39;t wasting any time...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> This year&#39;s Santa sure has been keeping busy...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Olé! Has the samba rhythm got you yet? Are you all nice and warmed up?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Then let&#39;s get this present party started, yes!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> So flashy it&#39;s refreshing! So potent it&#39;s dangerous! From high atop the ring post, here comes the Avalanche...of presents!</p><p><strong>Good Boys:</strong> Aaaugh!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> She definitely has a...unique way of handing out presents, but at least nothing strange is going on.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I think we might just have a normal Christmas in Chaldea this year...relatively speaking.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hey, guys? We&#39;ve gotta talk. Can you swing by the Command Room real quick? And, uh, bring the luchadora with you too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Aaand here we go...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (Sigh) Come on, Mash...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...So that&#39;s what&#39;s been going on in the time leading up to Christmas this year. With me so far?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So that&#39;s what the samba thing was about.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I don&#39;t even know where to start with this...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Hehe, oh no! I&#39;m so embarrassed! I guess even goddesses can make mistakes just like mortals!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Now we get to the real problem.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> We found out where the other half of your power and the Christmas Grail went.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Oh, bravo! I wasn&#39;t exactly worried about it, no, but knowing is always better!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> So, where did they go then?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> To your home. Mexico.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Last week, in fact. They went while Christmas preparations were still underway.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Oh? I&#39;m not sure what you mean.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You&#39;ll understand when you get there. Trust me, it&#39;s not your everyday Christmas prep.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Something is clearly messed up there, and we definitely have to sort it out.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> We may even have a minute Singularity on our hands.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So, basically...you want Senpai to go there and investigate, as usual?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yup. Pretty much. But don&#39;t worry; you&#39;ll also have a capable ally helping you out again.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Isn&#39;t that right, Quetzalcoatl? You don&#39;t mind helping to clean up this mess you made, do you?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Of course not!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Once I&#39;ve collected the things I dropped while I was changing, I&#39;ll be back to hand out more presents in no time!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Well, there&#39;s no time like the present! Let&#39;s get this samba Rayshift party started, yes!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> A white Christmas? In Mexico!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Achoo!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> F-fochoo... Fochooo!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> What...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I was aware that in some areas of Mexico, the temperature could get under freezing...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...but there shouldn&#39;t be anywhere staying that cold long enough to accumulate so much snowfall!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> And this doesn&#39;t look like fresh snow, either...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I suggest you use the winter clothes I packed for you, Master. You should find them at the bottom of your bag.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I heard Blackbeard grumbling about how there&#39;s nothing sadder than catching a cold on Christmas, so I wanted to make sure you were prepared for anything.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Of course, I made sure to pack a fluffy scarf for you too, Fou.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou fooou! Fouffy...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> There&#39;s our first major abnormality then. I can&#39;t imagine that just happened on its own.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Now, what about the people living there?</p><p><strong>Townsperson A:</strong> Brr, I&#39;m freezing. It&#39;s never been this cold before.</p><p><strong>Townsperson B:</strong> Sooo cold... But I haven&#39;t been this excited in ages, now that it&#39;s finally about to open... So, who&#39;s your money on?</p><p><strong>Townsperson A:</strong> The Mexican team, of course!</p><p><strong>Townsperson A:</strong> I know that&#39;s the obvious choice...but there really is something about them that makes me feel stronger! They&#39;re like the sun god come to life!</p><p><strong>Townsperson B:</strong> True, true. But the Russian team seemed pretty tough too, don&#39;t you think?</p><p><strong>Townsperson A:</strong> I mean, as long as we&#39;re thinking in that direction, there&#39;s something frighteningly unpredictable about the Chinese team, too...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Very strange, yes. Even though this bizarre cold is bothering them, they seem more preoccupied with something else.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Whatever is going on, the whole town seems abuzz with excitement, yes!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Just goes to show that humans can adjust to almost anything. This weather should be unheard of there, but everyone&#39;s just dismissing it as merely “odd.”</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hm? Oho, we just got a reading that looks like it might be related to the Holy Grail! I&#39;ll send you the coordinates right now, so stay on your guard and head on over there to see what you can find.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> You got it, yes!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Even the jungle is covered in snow. It&#39;s kind of refreshing, in a strange sort of way...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You should be coming up on the target area pretty soon now...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What the!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I think I see something!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A pyramid...!?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> It could be a temple, or a sacrificial altar. I wonder which it is...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> ...Huh? Who&#39;s there!?</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong> There you are, my other half. I&#39;ve been waiting for you.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>???:</strong> There you are, my other half. I&#39;ve been waiting for you.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Oh wow! Quién es esa luchadora with the amazingly awesome mask!? I might have to get her autograph, yes!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hahahaha. As if you don&#39;t already know it&#39;s the other half of you we&#39;re searching for!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou fou!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> I suppose this isn&#39;t the best time to be joking. Let me set my fighting spirit aside and do this properly...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Ahem. Hola, my other half. I&#39;m here to take you home.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> I can see you must have split off from me after my Spirit Origin became more Santay...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Pero you need to come back to me, um, me. What are you doing here, anyway?</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong> You saw the town for yourself. Isn&#39;t it obvious? I&#39;m getting things ready.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Huh? Ready for what?</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong> To create the true Santa Claus. What else?</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong> This ritual relies on the Christmas Grail&#39;s power. Whoever wins will become the true Santa.</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong> Behold!</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong> I plan to hold a competition that will decide the true Santa: the international Santa Tag Team Tournament!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s no altar. It&#39;s a ring!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Gah! What&#39;s wrong with me!? Nothing about this makes sense, but I can&#39;t help wanting to go along with it!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um... Quetzalcoatl?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Oh, sí. I only mean that if nothing else, I can tell she has a great deal of love for lucha.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> This...really isn&#39;t the time to be admiring that.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> These readings make it pretty clear that she&#39;s got the Holy Grail under control. We can&#39;t let her keep it!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master, Quetzalcoatl! Please, you have to stop her!</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong> If you want to stop me, you&#39;re very welcome to try.</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong> But I&#39;ll warn you now, Master of Chaldea and my other half, you&#39;d be wasting your time.</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong> I am Black Quetzal Mask!</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> I am the strongest ruda to ever live. I am the monarch who will reign over the greatest show in all the world: Christmas!</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> Those of you who have never so much as stepped into the ring will be down and out before the ref can count to three!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Hrrng!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> She&#39;s strong...!</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> I am you. I am the side of you that embraces fighting in all its forms. And like I said in my smack talk bit, you can&#39;t touch me.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Ah, entiendo... So that&#39;s why you chose a tournament as the format for this ritual.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> Hehehe... It would be sooo easy to just kill you both now, but you&#39;re in luck.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> I thought you might show up, so I kept a special seed slot open for you, so you could skip the prelims.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> You can take it, and try to make your way through the tournament. I will fight for Mexico. Claro?</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> If you&#39;re lucky, we can settle this in the finals.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...Rituals often have the effect of bringing two vastly different forces together, like humans and nature. Or gods and humans, in this case.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Fighting while bound by the same rules should help get around the difference in strength, but...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um... Can I ask you a question? Why would you suggest something that works to our advantage...?</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> Heh. I may be a ruda, but I am not a cheater, no. The ring is holy, and its rules absolute.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> Perhaps my respect for such things is even why this Spirit Origin was designated a Ruler.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> Furthermore...this battle is meant to celebrate Christmas.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> The more exciting it is, the better for everyone.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Hmm. Opponent or not, I can&#39;t argue with that! There&#39;s no point in putting on a show without working up the crowd, no!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Show stuff aside, I don&#39;t see you guys being able to win right now anyway.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> At this point, I think making a strategic retreat, entering this tournament, climbing the rankings...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...and eventually facing off against Dark Quetzal Mask in the ring might be our only realistic option.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> You should listen to the chica inteligente.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Why thank you. But you&#39;ll have to forgive me if I&#39;m not entirely buying what you&#39;re selling here.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It&#39;s a bit hard to believe you&#39;re using the Holy Grail&#39;s power out of the goodness of your heart.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> And since we can&#39;t let you get away with whatever you&#39;re planning, entering the tournament is just the most expedient way to stop you.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> Oh, don&#39;t doubt me. I meant everything I said.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> This battle will decide Santa&#39;s rightful successor. The winner WILL become Santa.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> A Santa so powerful they&#39;ll be able to make every day Christmas, whether it&#39;s December 25th or not....</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> ...and leave every other Santa as nothing more than a distant memory.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...(Gulp)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (I don&#39;t know what that means, but it sounds...big.)</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> As a Santa aspirant, I&#39;m sure you want this power for yourself.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> Now go on. The tournament begins tomorrow.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> Show me you meet the minimum qualifications to enter and I&#39;ll permit you to do so as Chaldea&#39;s team.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> Go ahead and do your worst. Hahahaha!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> This is a very unexpected twist, yes! But getting to fight by the rules of lucha is the best news I&#39;ve had all day!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> As long as I&#39;m in my precious lucha ring, I can piledrive that masked goddess into the mat any day of the week, yes!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Pero I still have no idea what she was talking about. She&#39;s very bad at explaining things.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> She said something about qualifications, yes?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Why would she tell us to qualify after she personally invited us to enter the tournament? It makes no sense...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Now that you mention it, that does seem strange...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Yeah, I wonder what that was all about?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Nnn, fou...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um... I&#39;m sorry to interrupt, but I think I might know what she meant.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> She gave us a hint earlier. What did she mean by “minimum qualifications”?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> ...Are you saying you figured it out?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. Black Quetzal Mask actually said it quite clearly.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This tournament...is a tag team competition!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Which means you need to find a partner who will step into the ring with you!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Plancha Suicidaaa!?</p><h2 id="day-0-an-encounter-with-a-knight-and-a-base-in-a-dense-forest" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#day-0-an-encounter-with-a-knight-and-a-base-in-a-dense-forest" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Day 0: An Encounter with a Knight and a Base in a Dense Forest</h2><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> I can&#39;t believe it... I never dreamed she would set such a diabolical trap, no!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> No matter how strong I am, I can&#39;t possibly fight in a tag team match by myself!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> That would go against everything lucha stands for, yes...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Ahh, where am I going to find a righteous luchador or luchadora who can fight by my side...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I trust this goes without saying, but just in case, remember that having Master join you in the ring is not going to be an option.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Sorry I&#39;m not in better shape.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Sorry I&#39;m not better at pro wrestling.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> That&#39;s okay. I could never actually drag you into the lucha ring, even if I wanted to.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> I still don&#39;t know what I&#39;m going to do, though... Hm?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Did you hear that? ...It came from that alley.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It looks like someone just collapsed.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Aah! That pile of rags is twitching!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I...don&#39;t think that&#39;s a pile of rags. Are you sure that isn&#39;t just a person all bundled up?</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong> Oogh... So hungry...</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong> I don&#39;t think...I&#39;m gonna make it... I&#39;m sorry...</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong> ...No. No! I&#39;m not giving up now. I&#39;ve been through much worse than this in my travels...!</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong> Still, starvation might be a first for me. Who knew going so long without eating could do this to you...</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong> ...Khh, now that I think about it, this might be the most humiliating thing that could happen to a knight. Just go ahead and kill me now!</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong> Not that there&#39;s anyone around to actually do that for me. Ah man...</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong> ...I could reaaally go for some bread right about now...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong> Wh-wha...? Oh man, I must be even closer to death than I thought.</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong> Now I&#39;m hallucinating a tiny animal that somehow reminds me of Lord Merlin booping me on the nose to see if I&#39;m alive...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou fooou, fo fo fooou!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I&#39;m guessing you&#39;ve put it together already, but that&#39;s a Servant under those rags.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> This particular Servant appears on the verge of disappearing due to severe lack of magical energy.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It&#39;s the Servant equivalent of dying in a ditch on the side of a road. So, what are you gonna do about it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I think I can at least give them some bread...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Well, since Fou went and confirmed they&#39;re still alive...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> My Master is so kind, yes! I love how you never hesitate to help someone in need!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> I&#39;ll help you. Come on, let&#39;s get them up and give them some water, too. Levántate.</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong> ...Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Are you awake now?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Did you get enough to eat?</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong> Huh? I don&#39;t understand... What&#39;s going on?</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong> And why can I still taste delicious wheat!?</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong> Wait a minute... Did you guys save me or something?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You could say that, yeah.</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong> Oh man, I knew it!</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong> I&#39;m so sorry for the trouble! This is so embarrassing. Knights are supposed to help others, not be helped...</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong> Oh, but where are my manners? Thank you so much!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s okay. All we did was provide you with a few supplies.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A little bread and water for nutrients, and a bit of magical energy from Master&#39;s Mystic Code has you back on your feet.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We have plenty of supplies to spare, so please, don&#39;t worry about it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I have to say though, I&#39;m surprised there was such a beautiful woman beneath all those rags.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Your shield is amazing, too. Like a burst of light. As a Shielder myself, I&#39;d love to hear all about it...!</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong> Hm? You&#39;re using magecraft to see and talk to me from far away...? Does that mean you guys are mages?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Not me! I am a Servant who brings joy to everyone with dancing and presents, yes!</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong> A dancer Servant? I didn&#39;t know those were a thing... You know, your outfit looks kind of familiar. Is that what&#39;s trendy right now?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I guess I&#39;m a mage. Technically.</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong> I knew it. Oh, I haven&#39;t heard many good things about mages, but I guess you did save my life. Then again...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fooou.</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong> Huh!? Wait a sec... I knew that animal reminded me of Lord Merlin! Err...well, it smells kind of like him.</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong> In fact...I kind of sense Lord Merlin in you two, too!</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong> Would you... Would you two happen to have some connection to him?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Well, I&#39;m a ways off from living in the lap of luxury like him.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I guess you could say we know each other.</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong> Great! Then I know I can trust you.</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong> I don&#39;t care for mages much–in fact, I kind of hate them–but Lord Merlin is another story.</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong> He&#39;s helped me out on my journey plenty of times!</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong> So you&#39;re a relative of Lord Merlin, huh? Great! You&#39;re not the first people like that to help me out of a jam!</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong> Oh, right, I almost forgot to introduce myself. My name&#39;s Bradamante. As a loyal knight to the Kingdom of the Franks, I travel the world, righting wrongs in the name of the true king!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Bradamante of the Franks? Does that mean you&#39;re one of the Twelve Paladins of Charlemagne?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> So you&#39;ve heard of us? Yes, I serve His Imperial Majesty Charlemagne alongside my brother, Rinaldo.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Astolfo&#39;s been a big help to me.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> You know Stolfo, too!? I apologize on his behalf if he&#39;s made any trouble for you!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> He&#39;s a good guy, really! He just...doesn&#39;t always think things through! Or, um...ever...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I could&#39;ve sworn I&#39;d seen Charlemagne on the moon or somewhere.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hmm, so many questions, so little time... Okay, let&#39;s start with this: Can you tell us how you got here?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Or at least how you ended up covered in rags, almost dead in an alley?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> I-it&#39;s, um....kind of a humiliating story... Especially for a knight...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> But since you did save my life, I suppose you deserve the truth. Okay, here&#39;s what happened...</p><p><strong>H：Bradamante:</strong> Hmm, I&#39;ve been summoned... I have no idea where this place is! Now what do I do?</p><p><strong>H：Bradamante:</strong> I don&#39;t see a spellcaster anywhere... Maybe I was summoned by some sort of relic or something? ...Hm? What&#39;s that?</p><p><strong>H：Bradamante:</strong> Whoa, this treasure must be awfully powerful. Is this what called me here?</p><p><strong>H：Bradamante:</strong> I&#39;m not sure... But I am sure there&#39;s only one thing to do when you find a powerful relic like this! You have to pray to it!</p><p><strong>H：Bradamante:</strong> Okay, uh... May there be peace on Earth and happiness for all in God&#39;s name.</p><p><strong>H：Bradamante:</strong> And, uh, speaking personally...there&#39;s this person I&#39;m looking for, so...</p><p><strong>H：Bradamante:</strong> Whaugh!</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> This Holy Grail goes only to the victor. I won&#39;t have anyone trying to steal it on my watch.</p><p><strong>H：Bradamante:</strong> Vic...tor...?</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> But you do appear to be some sort of hero yourself. Then I&#39;ll settle for stripping you of your power.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> Under the circumstances, I should even be able to add it to the Christmas Grail.</p><p><strong>H：Bradamante:</strong> Khh... If you&#39;re only going to humiliate me, then–</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> Kill you? No, I don&#39;t think so. I can&#39;t just reduce the number of fighters before the tournament starts.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> There shouldn&#39;t be a problem gathering more than enough, but better safe than sorry.</p><p><strong>H：Bradamante:</strong> (My magical shield should be able to...! ...Oh no, I&#39;m too lat–)</p><p><strong>H：Bradamante:</strong> Khh... Gaaah!</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> Hehehe... Hahahaha... It will be me who becomes the true Santa, but I should at least give everyone else a chance at it.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> If you wish to take back your power, your only recourse is to enter the Santa Tag Team Tournament! Haaahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> ...And there you have it. Oh, this is so embarrassing...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Now I see. So you&#39;re a victim of Black Quetzal Mask, too.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> But I am still a knight, sworn to see justice served! I don&#39;t know the meaning of the words “give up”!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> So I decided to take her advice, enter the tournament, get my power back, and rub it in her smug face...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> ...but then I found out you need a partner to participate.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> I tried exploring the town, but since I don&#39;t know my way around this place, I haven&#39;t been having any luck–</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> And eventually, your magical energy ran out and you ended up collapsing in the alley where we found you.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fou.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Such a kind gaze... Are you trying to cheer me up? Oh, Lord Fou, you and your Lord Merliny smell are so wonderful!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Still... Hehehe, your timing couldn&#39;t be better. Don&#39;t you agree, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Talk about divine providence.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Maybe Merlin really did have a hand in this.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou fou, fooou.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> ...Oh yes. As a matter of fact, I&#39;ve been examining you for a while now...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> A sexy, yet flexible leotard... A blue and white color scheme that would stand out beautifully in the ring...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> And above all...!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> You said your name was Bradaman!? It&#39;s like you were born with a great ring name...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Oh, you would be...nueva luchadora perfecta! Or rather, a technica and limpia, to use the official terms!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Wh-what? My name is Bradamante, not Bradaman!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Oh, really? Well, no problem. I&#39;ll just have to come up with a ring name for you myself then, yes!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> I will be using a ring name for myself as well!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Besides, this is the homeland of the faith that worshipped me, so better if I don&#39;t go around showing my face and using my True Name here. Instead...</p><p><strong>H：Quetzal Mask:</strong> Ta-da! And for my ring name, I&#39;ll go with...Quetzal Mask, Luchadora of Mystery!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (Bad. Ass!)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (She&#39;s really not cut out for disguises or dissembling, is she...)</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Huh!? You&#39;re the one from those ruins!? I THOUGHT I recognized your outfit! Now you&#39;re in for it!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> W-wait, please! Look, the mask is a different color! You&#39;ve got the wrong god!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> So she didn&#39;t even notice up till now... Well, that&#39;s okay. This is a good chance to explain why we&#39;re here.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> So, you want to enter the Santa Tag Team Tournament too...?</p><p><strong>H：Quetzal Mask:</strong> Sí! If Black Quetzal Mask is going to be the ruda, then I&#39;ll be the technica who&#39;ll take her down!</p><p><strong>H：Quetzal Mask:</strong> I was just out looking for a baby-faced teammate to join me in the ring when we found you, yes!</p><p><strong>H：Quetzal Mask:</strong> And as I said earlier, you would be perfect. Will you be my partner, por favor?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> It doesn&#39;t look like I have any choice.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> I don&#39;t care about being Santa, but I do need to win if I&#39;m going to reclaim my knightly powers.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> And most importantly, I owe you guys my life.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> All right then. On my honor as one of the Twelve Paladins of Charlemagne...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> ...I, Bradamante, vow to fight by your side as your tag team partner to the very last!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> By the way, I might as well ask: You haven&#39;t seen Ruggiero anywhere, have you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Who?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> In the legends of Charlemagne, Bradamante is generally depicted as pursuing her lover, Ruggiero.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> They started out as enemies, but fell in love after fighting a duel, only for fate to tear them apart...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Then she goes on to search far and wide for her lover, refusing to give up no matter the hardship she encounters.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I remember that story well. It&#39;s a wonderful tale of bravery and adventure!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> I-it&#39;s a little embarrassing, hearing you all saying it like that...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> But yes, that&#39;s pretty much what happened.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Even now, chasing after things is just in my nature. I can&#39;t help but try to look for them.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> I&#39;m sorry, I haven&#39;t seen anyone like that. You&#39;re the first Servant we&#39;ve met here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I don&#39;t think he&#39;s at Chaldea, either.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Gotcha... Maybe he&#39;s just nowhere to be found anymore...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> ...But that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m giving up!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Whether I&#39;m being pushed off a cliff or getting trapped in a mage&#39;s illusions, I don&#39;t ever give up!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> I can still see justice done, whether Ruggiero is here or not!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> So you can always count on me to do my very best, Manager!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Manager?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Oh, right! I almost forgot.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Now that Bradamante and I are a tag team, we share the same goal: winning the tournament!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> As for you, I told her you were our trainer-slash-manager who will help us with everything besides the fighting itself, yes!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> As a knight, I never forget the debts I owe to those who support me in my adventures.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> In fact, I&#39;ve also heard that you gave the order to help me when I was on the verge of disappearing.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Your kindness reminds me of Lord Merlin, Fujimaru. I have nothing but respect for you!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fooou? Fou fou fo fo fo fooou?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Damn, I&#39;ve never heard anyone actually speak fondly of Merlin. Not even the Knights of the Round Table like him.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Honestly, I have to wonder... Was it really his spirit that helped Bradamante out on her adventures...?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Huh? Did I just sense someone doubting Lord Merlin...?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ♪♪ (Whistling innocently)</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> (Well, I guess this just goes to show how earnest she is? Makes sense, given how her thing is being in love.)</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> How much longer until we&#39;re there? It feels like we&#39;ve been walking a long time now, no?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> We&#39;re almost there, all right? Would you just shush for meow and let me lead the way?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> I mean, it&#39;s not easy charting routes to keep all the different teams from running into each other, you know?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> In fact, it really wets my fur being caught between a good Kuku and a bad Kuku like this.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Even if I did already decide to side with the dark, scary Kuku, since she got to me first and I really, really don&#39;t wanna make her mad!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> I see... It sounds like you&#39;ve had it hard too, Jaguar.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Okay then, as soon as we get to our assigned gym, I&#39;ll pay you back by practicing my plancha on you.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> You&#39;ll be the perfect sacrificio to try out this Spirit Origin&#39;s new Noble Phan–I mean, lucha technique.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Whoa, whoa, slow your roll there, Kuku! I&#39;m just on the administrative team here, remember? This cool cat&#39;s gotta take care of all the fighters!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> So you keep your toe beans to yourself, you hear? And seriously, stop using me as your emotional (and physical) punching bag!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Hmph. Claro. That just means I&#39;ll have to dance the samba right on top of you, yes!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Now feel this censuring rhythm as it speaks directly to your conscience!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Please, stop! I honestly can&#39;t take it! Man, why&#39;re you the only one who gets to be a different class!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I feel I should ask why you are going to all this trouble to keep different teams from running into each other.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Oh, that? Dark Kuku said it was to keep the matches as fair as pawssible.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> That&#39;s why we&#39;re keeping the fighters&#39; info top secret, even from the other fighters. We&#39;re also keeping the brackets all hush-hush, meow.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Otherwise, the matches might be decided by whoever has the most intel, rather than who&#39;s really the strongest, meow.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> I see. I should have known my other half would be so thorough...</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Of course, that isn&#39;t stopping the townspeople from trading rumors and placing bets, but that&#39;s not my domain, so.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Anyway, we purrvide as fair a venue as possible, and all you fighters have to do is give it your all!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> So that&#39;s why you&#39;re giving us all our own gyms out here in the jungle.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Enemy or not, I must commend your chivalry in this!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Right? And it&#39;s not just the gym. This whole jungle is great for training, too. The reason being–</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> It&#39;s chock-full of monsters like these!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> There shouldn&#39;t be anything like these creatures in modern Mexican jungles.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Black Quetzal Mask and the Christmas Grail must have brought them here, just like the snow... At any rate, I can&#39;t let them run around doing whatever they please.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> This&#39;ll be a good preliminary skirmish!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> This should be a good warm-up!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Correcto, Master! Let me just put my mask on to get in character...</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> Well, partner, are you ready?</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> Don&#39;t worry! These are weak! We can carve our way through them as easily as dancing a samba, yes!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Right! Thanks to Fujimaru, I&#39;ve got a good amount of magical energy back, too!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Let&#39;s go, Quetzal Mask! I&#39;ll show you firsthand how brightly my magical shield of justice shines!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> No contenders shall be turned away. The path to becoming the true Santa is open to all.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> However, some rules must be set in place, lest everyone on Earth be swept up in a massive battle royale.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> And so I hope you will understand why I have chosen to limit the pool of applicants by their country of origin.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> In return, I promise that the sweetness of fighting for your homeland will make the battle all the more delicious.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...See see see! Once we become the true Santa, Christmas will be ours to rule!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Of course I&#39;m going for this. I have to.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Duhuhu! Once we become Santa, even we won&#39;t have any trouble scoring chicks!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Yeah! As long as we never give up, we have as good a chance of becoming Santa as anyone!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> What do I think about Santa? As if you need ask.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Santa is a weapon.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> (*We at the Santa Tag Team Tournament have censored this comment due to excessive brutality. We apologize for the inconvenience.)</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Don&#39;t worry! Everyone I&#39;ve seen here is so weak! We can tear our way through them as easily as dancing a samba, yes!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Remember, regardless of your motives for becoming the true Santa, all are equal once they step through these ropes!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Now...the ring has been set.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Come forth, contenders among contenders for the crown of Santa, and show us what you are made of!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...What did I just watch?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Can&#39;t say I saw that promo video coming.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um... Jaguar Warrior? What was that...?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> The video? The boss said to play it after showing each team to their gym-base thingy, meow.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> It&#39;s a smart, stylish way to get the fighters fired up in lieu of an opening ceremony. You should be glad you got to see it!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> We also had all the fighters wear disguises so they wouldn&#39;t spoil anything!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> I guess you could call them Mysterian Servants?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> So why was I the only one you didn&#39;t do that for?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> In fact, our whole section of the video was taken from the battle we had with those monsters just now!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> And I am quite sure that you chose that only to make it look like I was talking trash, yes!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> I think I even saw “Confusion” written on the screen right after! This is absolutely malicious editing!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Yep, that footage was one-hundred-purrcent fresh! Right from the camera to the screen!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Dark Kuku said to go ahead and use it since nobody would know who the mysterious masked woman was, so I did.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> This isn&#39;t my fault! Please don&#39;t samba on my conscience again!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> What about that part at the end where it said one hundred teams would be competing? Is that true?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Sure is. We&#39;re talking about a weeklong tournament where one team could end up fighting in up to seven matches.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> That&#39;s not even counting the four seed teams Dark Kuku has waiting in the wings. They&#39;re kind of like the Four Heavenly Kings, and they&#39;re scary as hell, meow.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Oh, and fur your information, there&#39;s no telling if any of the teams you saw in that video are one of the special seed teams...</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> ...and there&#39;s also no guarantee that you&#39;ll be matched against one during the tournament.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So when&#39;s our first match?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Let&#39;s see... You guys are in the special slot, so...you&#39;ve pretty much got at least a whole day.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> &#39;Course, the first round&#39;s got the most fighters, so it&#39;s gonna be reeeally rough. I ain&#39;t kitten you, there&#39;ll be familiars, clones, the works.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Anyway, I&#39;ll come get you right before you&#39;re up, so go ahead and spend your time however you like until then. In fact...go do what you want, and like it!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The first match will be especially important, so we&#39;ll have to make sure we&#39;re ready for anything.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Let&#39;s see... What do you want us to do, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Why don&#39;t you two spar in the ring to get used to each other&#39;s style?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It might be good training to just keep fighting the creatures outside.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Makes sense to me! Will do! I promise I&#39;ll do everything I can to get ready for our match!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> No objections here! Let&#39;s make sure we&#39;re in tip-top shape for our match, Bradaman!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> ...Um, could you just call me by my normal name when we&#39;re not in a match? It feels kind of weird otherwise...</p><h2 id="day-1-confronting-the-inevitable-and-silliness" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#day-1-confronting-the-inevitable-and-silliness" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Day 1: Confronting the Inevitable...and Silliness</h2><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> ...It&#39;s time, meow.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Ooh, so this is it. Are you all ready?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Spirit, not strength, is most important to start a campaign. You must be mentally prepared to go to battle.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> You can always get your body warmed up in battle, but there&#39;s no helping an unprepared mind, no!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> If you need a shot of courage, we can always dance a samba! Come on, shake your hips with me! Olé!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> No need to worry about me! The Paladins of Charlemagne are always ready for battle!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> You kind of have to be when the others are a pack of crazy children who cause nothing but trouble...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I think I might be the most nervous one here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I hope I can be a good trainer...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> You have nothing to worry about either, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> I have a very good idea of your coaching skills now, thanks to all the training we&#39;ve done.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> I know you&#39;re every bit as trustworthy a mage as Lord Merlin!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Besides, we have our own glorious knightly ambitions that shine so bright!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> I&#39;m fighting to take back my stolen power, and Quetzalcoatl is fighting to take back her rightful Santa Claus power.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> I don&#39;t think our opponents have the drive, or the NEED to win like us! Why, I bet they&#39;re just out to claim the Santa title on a whim!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> With justice on our side, we can&#39;t possibly lose!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hmm, I&#39;m not so sure about that. It looked like there were all sorts of competitors in that promo, you know?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Here we are! Your opponents have already arrived, meow.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So they&#39;re still disguised. I guess we won&#39;t even know who they are until it&#39;s time to fight...!</p><p><strong>Mysterian Servant No. 1:</strong> Heh... You really cannot tell? How imprudent of you.</p><p><strong>Mysterian Servant No. 2:</strong> Hm...? Hmm... Wait, what!?</p><p><strong>Mysterian Servant No. 1:</strong> Hm? What is it, partner? Is something bothering you?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> To be purrfectly frank, there&#39;s no reason for them to still be wearing those cloaks with the match so close at hand! It&#39;s just a mood thing, really.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Now go on! That ring on top of the pyramid is looking mighty empty!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Once you&#39;re up there, go ahead and reveal your true identities!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> And please, try to hurry? There were sooo many matches today, and I&#39;m dog–I mean, cat-tired! Dark Kuku is really running this jaguar ragged!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> All right then, let&#39;s get the final match of the first round of the Santa Tag Team Tournament underway! Our matchup is...!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Chaldea vs. England!!!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Who better to be the true Santa than the original? That you fail to grasp something so simple is deplorable.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Santa Alter!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> It has been quite some time, Reindeer. Christmas has come once again.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This is only your first match, but you&#39;re already facing such a powerful opponent!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Although... Um, isn&#39;t her partner from France...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Hm? Astolfo?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Do not say it, Reindeer. Remember, you are an honorary reindeer.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> And since I could not find you anywhere, I had no choice but to hold auditions. This is the result.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> He says his bloodline makes him an English prince, and he has an animal with which to draw my sleigh, and so I accept that he is qualified.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> No way! It IS you, Bradamante! Hey heeey, how&#39;ve you been? I&#39;m doing great, thanks!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Whoa! It really has been forever, hasn&#39;t it, Stolfo?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> I never expected to run into you here, but I could tell you were doing well as soon as I heard your voice. Phew.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> ...So, um...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> He hasn&#39;t been making too much trouble for you all, has he?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Nope! He&#39;s pretty much always like that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Nah. His cheerfulness is actually really nice.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Hey! I&#39;ll have you know people really depend on me here!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> By the way, Stolfo...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> ...is it just me, or are you even cuter now? Hmm, what&#39;s changed...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Oh, I&#39;ve got it! It&#39;s your outfit! That&#39;s the one you got after Roland went nuts, isn&#39;t it!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> It&#39;s adorable, right!? I always wanna be the cutest me I can be!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> It really is! Rinaldo might not approve, but I think that outfit is great!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Say, uh, Bradamante? I just had a thought. If you&#39;re here with Master, not off on a journey... (Gulp)</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> ...does that mean you and Ruggiero broke up?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> D-don&#39;t be ridiculous, Stolfo! Of course I&#39;m still looking for him!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Well, just in case, I&#39;m pretty sure Master isn&#39;t his reincarnation or anything, okay?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> I know that! Fujimaru and I are only together by...happenstance, I guess?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> I am here to pay [♂ him /♀ her] back for saving my life, just like any holy knight would.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Don&#39;t worry, I have the greatest respect for [♂ him /♀ her] as a mage-slash-manager, especially as [♂ he /♀ she] knows Lord Merlin. I would never confuse [♂ him /♀ her] for Ruggiero.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Oh, okay! I just had to ask, since I know a kinda snaky girl who&#39;s reeeal big on romance, but in a, um, veeery different way.</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> That&#39;s right. It is both happenstance and destiny that brought us here today. And it seems this will be a showdown between the old Santa and the new, yes?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Old and new? Cursed Altera. What was she thinking, entrusting my role to this gaudy, flamboyant woman...</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> ...Tch. I will admit that you must be the world&#39;s strongest Christmas tree. You certainly stand out.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> However, the only song suited for Christmas is Jingle Bells! Your samba has no place here.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> As the original Santa, it is my duty and right to test your powers personally!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> I&#39;m just here &#39;cause it sounded like fun!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> I mean, reindeer get to wear Santa outfits if they want to, right? I think it&#39;d look real cute on me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So one member of the first tag team you will face turned out to be another fighter with clear reasons for wanting to become the true Santa, and the other turned out to be...well, Astolfo.</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> This is all my fault, yes.</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> So I&#39;m going to clean up my own mess, and prove beyond all doubt I can be a great Santa! See for yourselves!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Santa&#39;s role has nothing to do with shaking one&#39;s booty! (The sound argument)</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> Ulp... I will hand out presents too, of course! But Santa should evolve with the times, yes!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Whoa! Things are really heating up now!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> In the red corner, representing England, we have the Great Britain Combination! And in the blue corner, representing Chaldea, we have the Quetzal Sisters!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Are the fighters all set? Then let&#39;s get ready to jingllle!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Bouclier d&#39;Atlante!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Aah! I can&#39;t see!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Now&#39;s my chance!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Sorry, Stolfo, but there&#39;s too much at stake for me to go easy on you.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> There! All I have to now is wait for him to come back down, and–</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Huh? Why can&#39;t I move my lance?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Heh heh heh. You&#39;ll need to do better than that to get past my trusty hippogriff!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ah! Astolfo&#39;s hippogriff just perched on the tip of Bradamante&#39;s lance! I can&#39;t believe how nimble it is!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Well, don&#39;t forget it can fly on its own.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> (Staaare)</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Hey, Stolfo? That&#39;s not MY hippogriff, is it?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Huh? Oh, err, good question. Ahaha, you know, I&#39;m not entirely sure!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> &#39;Cause he looks an awful lot like the one I worked so hard to take from that evil mage Atlante!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> So why are you going around riding him like you own him? Well!?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Hey, come on! I rode him after all that went down too, so I have just as much right as you do!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Then he really IS my hippogriff!? Get down here this instant so I can take a closer look at him!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> I don&#39;t know... I mean–</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Do not let them distract you, Pinky! Look out above!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Huh!? You mean the other one&#39;s even higher up than me and my hippogriff!?</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> Sí! We luchadoras excel at airborne mobility! A bounce from the ropes is all I need to get so high up, yes!</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> There, that should be high enough! Present Nucadora!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> She&#39;s gonna powerbomb him, hippogriff and all!?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Oogh...</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Dammit! Hold on, I shall come and–</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Oh, no you won&#39;t!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Kh...! My eyes...!</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> Nosotras ganamos! Ahh, I never get tired of hearing that three-count, no!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Phew. W-we won... Thank goodness...</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Now then, Stolfo, where were we?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> H-hey, come on, be reasonable. I can&#39;t give him back to you now; he&#39;s my Noble Phantasm!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> ...Fine, then just take good care of him, okay? Oh, but more importantly...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Ruggiero rode him too, right? So maybe there&#39;s still a little of his scent on him?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> I think he used to sit around here... Or was it here? Ahh...</p><p><strong>Hippogriff:</strong> Squaaawk!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> She&#39;s, uh, really sniffing away there, huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> She&#39;s digging her nose into the hippogriff&#39;s backwith a thousand-yard stare...</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Hey, Master? You&#39;ve prolly already figured this out by now, but Bradamante gets kinda...stupid sometimes.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Stolfo!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> ...A present drop, hm. It would seem you have at least the bare minimum of pride necessary for a Santa.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Very well, a loss is a loss. I concede, and we shall step aside for you.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> But remember, this is only the beginning. From here on, you shall face all manner of aspiring Santas.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> They may be Santas from the past, like myself, or they may be–</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> No matter! I am the newest Santa, and the only one to deliver presents while dancing! I fear nothing!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Thank you for all your help, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> I was really able to relax and focus on fighting thanks to your orders.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Of course! [♂ He&#39;s /♀ She&#39;s] not just a great manager, after all. [♂ He&#39;s /♀ She&#39;s] also got what it takes to be a great trainer!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I agree with that, of course...but I must say, I was surprised how serious your opponents were about winning.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We should probably expect the other upcoming battles to be similarly challenging...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Good point. You never know what might happen in a battle, after all. We need to be ready for anything...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Ahh, my beloved gym! So good to be back! Thank goodness we didn&#39;t have to say goodbye after our first match!</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong> There you are. I&#39;ve been waiting for you.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Huh!? Who are you!?</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong> I didn&#39;t come here to talk. I came to fight.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Nnn...?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou fou!</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong> Oh good, you&#39;re finally awake.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong> My apologies for getting so rough... I didn&#39;t mean to take it this far.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> If you really want to apologize, why don&#39;t you start by taking off that disguise?</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong> Oh, right. I only wore this because I wanted you to face me without bias.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong> Now that I&#39;ve tested your strength for myself, it&#39;s no longer necessary. Pardon me...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Martha!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Martha? As in, the saint of Tarascon?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What are you doing here, Martha? Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;ve entered the Santa Tag Team Tournament too...?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> No, although I did come here with that in mind.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I thought if Saint Nicholas wasn&#39;t going to be teaching children right from wrong, it would fall to me instead.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I&#39;ve noticed that, lately, people have been asking me why I&#39;m carrying a cross, like they have forgotten that I am a saint at all...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> ...so I thought this would be a good opportunity to restore my original saintly image.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> So, just to be clear, you&#39;re not in the tournament, right?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> That&#39;s right. I sort of forcefully entered the prelims with Tarasque as my partner, but unfortunately, I failed to qualify.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> What rotten luck. How could I have known a puppy would try to cross the tracks during the Train Attack event!?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Well, I couldn&#39;t just let him get run over, could I? What self-respecting saint could!? I had no choice but to stop the train in its tracks!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (Couldn&#39;t she have just grabbed the dog and run...?)</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou fooou!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Now I understand. That story tells me everything I need to know about how trustworthy you are, yes!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> But there&#39;s something I don&#39;t get. Why would a saint, pure of heart and perfect of body, want to ambush us?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Because I wanted to test your strength, obviously.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I may have failed to qualify, but I still have to give you a piece of my mind.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Not you, Quetzalcoatl; your religion and this samba thing are way outside my area. No, my business is with you!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> M-me?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Yes, you. I used a secret move to spy...I mean, observe your first match...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> ...and you don&#39;t seem nearly as much like a holy knight as you should!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> !</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I can&#39;t stand seeing you not living up to your potential! I know that you can manage a much holier aura than that!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Don&#39;t you have some sort of divine protection? Something that could emit a blinding white light for kilometers whenever you make a move!?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> I-I&#39;m pretty sure I never had anything like that...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> But, you do have a point. With over half of my power gone...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> ...I can&#39;t imagine I&#39;m doing what I should as one of King Charlemagne&#39;s holy paladins...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I&#39;m sure you&#39;re not. Which is why I&#39;m here to help.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Huh?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Training you should prove–if indirectly–that I am not just some rowdy town girl!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> So it would benefit both of us!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> So just say the word, and I&#39;ll teach you everything I know about my holy fighting style!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Y-yes! Please! I was just thinking I need to train for the upcoming battles!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> We&#39;ve got a coach!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> We&#39;ve got a trainer!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Olé! In that case, you&#39;re more than welcome here, yes! You can never have too many sparring partners!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> This calls for a celebratory samba!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This is certainly an unexpected development, but it looks like the Chaldea team has a new staff member!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So let&#39;s take advantage of this to get in plenty of training for the next match!</p><h2 id="day-2-santa-s-killer-instinct" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#day-2-santa-s-killer-instinct" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Day 2: Santa&#39;s Killer Instinct</h2><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Put your back into it! And don&#39;t forget the prayer!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Imagine there&#39;s a real smug bastard with a super punchable face leering down at you, then go like this!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Saint! Saint! I call this one...Saint Samurai Style!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Sa...Saint!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> (Huff, huff)</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> You follow instructions amazingly well. I never thought you would get this far in a single day...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> You soaked up my teachings like a sponge! I&#39;m a little jealous of what a good foundation you knights have.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Here, have a towel.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Thank you, Manager!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Aah... There&#39;s nothing better than a fluffy towel after working up a good sweat!</p><p><strong>Tarasque:</strong> Gruuu... (I&#39;m kinda wiped out too, Boss...)</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I&#39;m sorry to ask so much of you, Tarasque. I really do appreciate your help. Here, have some water.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Oh, but don&#39;t get too comfortable. You need to stay fierce if you&#39;re going to be a good sparring partner.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Especially since you&#39;re helping me to teach her one of my fighting styles, namely, “Pacifying Raging Beasts.”</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Does that mean all those sounds I thought were coming from a punching bag were actually–</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Time for your second match!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> That was sooner than I expected.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Bradamante, I&#39;ve done my best to teach you the fundamentals, but I still haven&#39;t passed on the entirety of my style.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> So get out there and win, and we&#39;ll pick up where we left off.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> You got it, Coach!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Olé!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Hmm, it&#39;s so nice to have an expert around who still hits back after I surprise them with a plancha.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Now I have even more chances to practice and develop quick counterattacks!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I wish you would stop doing that. It&#39;s exhausting...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Anyway, you be careful, too.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> You may have retained your combat senses when you got knocked down to being a demigod, but that alone is not going to be enough.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I imagine you&#39;ll struggle most against those calculating fighters out there.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Gracias! I&#39;ll be sure to keep that in mind, yes!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I wonder where your opponents for the second match are from...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fou.</p><p><strong>Mysterian Servant No. 1:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> Oh? I sense some powerful fighting spirit indeed... That one looks like they&#39;ll put up a good fight.</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> I can&#39;t wait to face them in the ring, yes!</p><p><strong>Mysterian Servant No. 2:</strong> ...Oh gods, my stomach is killing me...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> That other one already looks exhausted... I wonder why?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Now, let&#39;s see who&#39;ll be competing in this battle! Do the face reveal!</p><p><strong>E：:</strong> Did someone say battle!?</p><p><strong>E：:</strong> ...Tch, I can&#39;t smell him...</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> Phew, looks like I get to keep breathing for at least another day. This is hell on my poor heart.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> If we ever do end up fighting the Greek team with you-know-who on it, I&#39;m just gonna run while I can...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> If those two are here, then they must be...</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Yup. They&#39;re representing Troy, meow.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I didn&#39;t know fighters could represent countries and cities that don&#39;t even exist anymore...</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Oh yeah, Dark Kuku&#39;s totally cool with anything! Shouldn&#39;t that have been obvious since Chaldea got its own team?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Hm? Is that... Um, excuse me, but the way your weapon shines looks very familiar.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> That wouldn&#39;t be Durendal...would it?</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> Hm? Uh, yeah, I guess so. Though I call it Durindana myself.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Oh my gosh! Th-then, if you&#39;re representing Troy...does that mean you&#39;re Lord Hektor?</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> It&#39;s a little weird to be called “Lord” by a girl I&#39;ve never met befo... Wait. On second thought, I could get used to this.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> Indeed, I am the one and only Hektor of Troy, missy. Did we know each other back when I was alive or something?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> I knew it! I&#39;m Bradamante, a knight of the Franks.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> I&#39;ve heard all sorts of rumors about you, Lord Hektor. One of them says you&#39;re Ruggiero&#39;s heroic ancestor!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> That would mean you&#39;re King Charlemagne&#39;s...and by extension, my ancestor, as well...</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> Really? I can&#39;t say I know too much about my bloodline after I died...but if that&#39;s true, that&#39;s quite the coincidence.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> Even more so since we&#39;re meeting for the first time and are about to have to fight each other.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> That&#39;s true. Still...there&#39;s something I&#39;ve always wanted to tell you, if I ever got the chance.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Would you mind if I told you now...?</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> &#39;Course not. It&#39;s not every day you get to meet your own ancestor, right? Oh, should I grab a pen to sign something?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Okay then...here goes...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Take care of your gear, dammit!</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> Huh!?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> And I don&#39;t just mean Durendal. That goes for your armor, too!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Do you have any idea how much trouble we paladins have had to deal with because of your gear? I can&#39;t even count all the weirdos we&#39;ve had to fight!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Your shining gear has been the source of so many conflicts... So, so many...</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> T-that so? Sorry. I wish I could&#39;ve helped out more with that, but since I was, you know, dead at the time...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Ah!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Y-yes... That&#39;s, um... You&#39;re right... I&#39;m so sorry, Lord Hektor...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> We&#39;ve just had so much trouble because of that gear, I got a little carried away...</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> Man, you&#39;re an earnest one, aren&#39;t you. ...Hm? Is this what they call the student council president type?</p><p><strong>E：:</strong> Whatever connection those two may have, it is no concern of ours.</p><p><strong>E：:</strong> All that matters is whether you are weak or strong. I am pleased to see that you look like you could provide me with a proper fight, though.</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> I think I feel the same way! You two remind me of a wild animal and its tamer, yes!</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> Still...I may as well ask. Why do you want to become the true Santa Claus?</p><p><strong>E：:</strong> Heh. As if the answer were not obvious.</p><p><strong>E：:</strong> So I can use the power of Santa to kill him.</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> ...Qué?</p><p><strong>E：:</strong> I am told that Santa is a granter of wishes.</p><p><strong>E：:</strong> I have never needed nor wanted another&#39;s help in making my own wishes come true, for such is the mark of a weakling.</p><p><strong>E：:</strong> But...if I were the one granting wishes, then there would be no issue. None in my tribe could object to using power in such a way.</p><p><strong>E：:</strong> And so I shall become Santa Claus, and in doing so, I will gain the power to grant my own wish!</p><p><strong>E：:</strong> I will, in essence, be using Santa Claus as a weapon, much like my beloved mace.</p><p><strong>E：:</strong> Hehe... Soon, the time will come when the blood that is spilled at his hour of death shall drip from the name of Santa Claus!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m not really sure what she&#39;s talking about, but I do know she&#39;s as singularly focused on her sole obsession as ever!</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> Hmm. Usually, I wouldn&#39;t mind the mix of pure and impure motives like this...</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> ...but as I am this year&#39;s Santa, I cannot condone using the power for such selfish ends, no!</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> You really think she&#39;ll listen to reason? That&#39;s, uh, not really what this Berserker is about. Trust me.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> Ugh, this is such a pain. This old man just wants to go home...but someone&#39;s gotta keep the reins on her so she doesn&#39;t cause even more trouble.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> Even if it is kinda ironic that the reindeer partner&#39;s the one holding the reins.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> And, well, if she does manage to beat his ass black and blue, you won&#39;t exactly see me crying.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> He and I aren&#39;t really what you&#39;d call friends. And if he can get his without me having to risk getting my ass kicked, so much the better!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> I can&#39;t say I&#39;m surprised, Lord Hektor, but I&#39;m still disappointed that you would think to use Santa Claus&#39;s power for your own benefit.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> As a true and holy paladin, I cannot let this stand!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Those of us with power have a responsibility to wield it properly, just like we need to take good care of our gear!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> So you all have personal reasons for fighting today, meow? ...I&#39;ll allow it! Go wild out there!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> In the red corner, representing Troy, we have the A.Revengers! And in the blue corner, representing Chaldea, we have the Quetzal Sisters!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Annnd fight!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> You know, I wasn&#39;t sure what to make of that at first, but now I get it.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> You&#39;re using that samba thing to figure out how your opponents will act. I&#39;ve seen it enough times now to recognize the pattern!</p><p><strong>F：:</strong> [[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Yikes, she&#39;s so strong! It&#39;s like fighting a raging beast...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> ...Raging beast...?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> (Gasp) I understand now, Coach! This is the time for me to use that technique you just taught me!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> One of Lady Martha&#39;s many fighting styles: “Pacifying Raging Beasts.”</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Okay, assume the stance...fill my heart with devout prayer...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> ...then punch with all my righteousness! Saint!</p><p><strong>F：:</strong> Khh... Did she just focus her strength to enhance her attacks!?</p><p><strong>F：:</strong> So you have a routine to strengthen your warrior&#39;s soul in an instant...not unlike the Amazons&#39; roar!</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> Whoa, whoa, come on, Queenie. Don&#39;t tell me you actually lost!?</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> Damn, maybe I should&#39;ve used that secret cologne I had made to kick her rage up another notch:</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> “Eau de Greece: Absolute Rampage”...</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> Then again, if I had, there&#39;s a solid chance I&#39;d have been the first casualty of that rage. Too risky.</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> Your team&#39;s division of labor couldn&#39;t be more obvious, no! She is always focused on offense while you are always playing defense!</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> But now that your partner is down for the count, you will find that defense alone cannot win a match, no!</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> Ow ow ow ow...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Lord Hektor, I just want to check while I can... You wouldn&#39;t happen to know where Ruggiero has materialized, would you?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> You don&#39;t? Okay, I just had to ask...</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> Phew! Our opponents were tough, but we are getting stronger too, yes!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou fooou!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Good job! Let&#39;s keep on winning!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m not used to battles like this. This is all so nerve-wracking.</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> Nerve-wracking? I think you mean exciting!</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> Lucha Libre is meant to get you muy emocionada by all the dazzling techniques being employed one after another! Though of course, it&#39;s even more exciting when you win, yes!</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> Now come on, let&#39;s all dance a victory samba to celebrate in style! Olé!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Let&#39;s not let the victory go to our heads.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Good point. We shouldn&#39;t take it easy just because things have been going well.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> ...(Sigh) If only more of the Twelve Paladins thought like that...</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> So, they won. Good. This should help keep things interesting.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> This is a festival of fighting. Painful fights, bloody fights, intense fights, fights to the death, and more!</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> I want to hear bones breaking! Screams of agony! War cries! The sounds of battle echoing far and wide!</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> For it is then that the true Santa Claus will be born. A Santa with the power to keep Christmas going forever...</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> Now, who is my other half&#39;s next opponent... Hehe, I see. One of the four strongest teams.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> It doesn&#39;t matter which one wins, as long as the battle is fierce.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> The tournament is a truly wonderful invention. The results of one match feed directly into the next, and the losers&#39; regrets weave together to push the battles ever forward...</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> Hehe. Be warned, other me. Your next opponents are truly formidable.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> They are one of the Four Heavenly Kings...the team that embodies growth better than any other.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> I look forward to seeing how you fight against them...</p><p><strong>Mysterian Servant No. 2:</strong> So, what do you wanna do? Should we practice for tomorrow or something?</p><p><strong>Mysterian Servant No. 1:</strong> Haha, our combination is already perfect. Better to conserve our energy than waste it.</p><p><strong>Mysterian Servant No. 1:</strong> Besides, our time would be much better spent coming up with a flashy entrance for our next match!</p><p><strong>Mysterian Servant No. 1:</strong> Deee see see see see! (Laughing, technically)</p><h2 id="day-3-eternal-feasting-in-paradise" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#day-3-eternal-feasting-in-paradise" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Day 3: Eternal Feasting in Paradise</h2><p><strong>Martha:</strong> There they go...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I may not have been able to teach her everything I know, but at least I was able to get through the basics.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Still...in the end, a fighting style is nothing more than an opportunity. Especially since she isn&#39;t a saint.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> But even so, I&#39;m certain we value the same things.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> She holds all that is holy and righteous in her heart, even as she faces down all that is wrong.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I helped her to build a foundation, in hopes that it might be of at least a little help in regaining the strength she has lost.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Good luck, Bradamante. It may not be much, but I&#39;ll be praying for your victory...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So that&#39;s our next opponent...!</p><p><strong>Mysterian Servant No. 1:</strong> Deee see see see! It&#39;s about time you showed up! We&#39;ve been out here for ages!</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> So that is our next opponent, hmm... Their laugh is so unnatural I can&#39;t help but be suspicious, yes!</p><p><strong>Mysterian Servant No. 1:</strong> YOU are going to talk to ME about being unnatural while you&#39;re dressed like that!?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Never mind that, Quetzal Mask. Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s strange that there&#39;s only one of them?</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> True. Can&#39;t fight a tag team battle alone. And if their partner had been injured, they would have had to forfeit.</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> So where could the other one be...?</p><p><strong>Mysterian Servant No. 1:</strong> Deee see see! So you haven&#39;t figured it out? What am I saying? Of course not!</p><p><strong>Mysterian Servant No. 1:</strong> My partner...is already here!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Huh!? Why is the ground moving!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Say whaaaaaat!?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fooou!?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> I think...there&#39;s a giant that&#39;s shaking this entire pyramid!?</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> Wow! Even I have to admit that is one amazing entrance, yes!</p><p><strong>Mysterian Servant No. 1:</strong> That&#39;s it! Way to make an impact!</p><p><strong>Mysterian Servant No. 1:</strong> This is exactly the sort of forward-thinking innovation we intellectual Servants live for!</p><p><strong>Mysterian Servant No. 1:</strong> ...That said, don&#39;t you think that&#39;s enough now, partner? I&#39;m starting to feel a little...urp...dizzy myself.</p><p><strong>Mysterian Servant No. 2:</strong> &#39;Kaaay! I&#39;ll go back to normal then.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Huh? That other one seems a lot smaller now...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> I mean, they&#39;re still plenty big, but nowhere near big enough to pick up a whole pyramid.</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> They can shrink and grow their body at will? Then they must be–</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Everyone done with their warm-ups? Then let&#39;s see who you&#39;re up against, meow!</p><p><strong>Lionman:</strong> Deee see see see! I am the Direct Current Superhuman...Lionman!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Direct Current...Superhuman...?</p><p><strong>Lionman:</strong> My ring name, of course! It signifies my love for direct current and my superhuman capabilities!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Ohhh, now I get it. DC... Dee see...</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> ...Sí, sí! This is the perfect lucha show I&#39;ve been waiting for!</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> What a wonderful lion mask you made!</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> I&#39;m so happy to finally find an opponent using a ring name!</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> So that strange laugh you were doing was all part of your character... Estoy extática!</p><p><strong>Lionman:</strong> Hehehe... I mean, dee see see see! (Delighted) And I&#39;m glad you understand, madam.</p><p><strong>Lionman:</strong> As you surely know, professional wrestling is hugely popular in the United States as well.</p><p><strong>Lionman:</strong> Every moment of a wrestler&#39;s performance, from their entrance to their exit is a grand spectacle. Music, video, gunpowder, the works!</p><p><strong>Lionman:</strong> We may have fallen behind Japan&#39;s genius promoters for a time, but there&#39;s still no wrestling like U.S. wrestling!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I guess this means that Edison–</p><p><strong>Lionman:</strong> My name is Lionman!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Er, Lionman, and his partner, Bunyan, must be representing America then.</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong> Yup! I&#39;m gonna do my best!</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong> Too bad the ring&#39;s so tiny... It reminds me of land that&#39;s been cultivated, since there&#39;s not even a blade of grass on it.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> A man with a lion&#39;s head, and a child... What an unusual combination.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> So the two of you are seeking Santa Claus&#39;s power as well?</p><p><strong>Lionman:</strong> Indeed. Well, I should say that I am not personally seeking to become Santa Claus.</p><p><strong>Lionman:</strong> Rather, it is the future that Black Quetzal Mask–or rather, this event–promises to create.</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> Hm? So, you aren&#39;t trying to become Santa yourself?</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> You just support my arrogant other half&#39;s idea of making the victor of this tournament into Santa?</p><p><strong>Lionman:</strong> Correct. According to her, whoever becomes the true Santa Claus will have the power to make Christmas last forever.</p><p><strong>Lionman:</strong> And a never-ending Christmas would be cause for celebration, regardless of who the true Santa ends up being.</p><p><strong>Lionman:</strong> Why, you ask!? Because Christmas every day means there will be presents every day!</p><p><strong>Lionman:</strong> And that means every factory in the world will be kept running at full capacity all the time!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> ...!?</p><p><strong>Lionman:</strong> And not just toy factories. There&#39;s food processing plants, artificial Christmas tree mills, Santa outfit shops...</p><p><strong>Lionman:</strong> All forms of mass production will be synonymous with joy! And, of course, each of these wonderful factories will positively guzzle down direct current!</p><p><strong>Lionman:</strong> Mass production AND massive consumption! That is what Christmas is all about!</p><p><strong>Lionman:</strong> ...Which is why I don&#39;t care who the true Santa Claus ends up being, as long as they make eternal Christmas a reality, it would bring me immeasurable joy.</p><p><strong>Lionman:</strong> As for my partner here–</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong> Christmas every day would be lots of fun! You all think so too, right?</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong> Besides...if I got to be Santa myself...</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong> ...then I could go around giving out presents with little Jeanne and the other Santas! Hehehe.</p><p><strong>Lionman:</strong> ...And there you have it.</p><p><strong>Lionman:</strong> Now do you understand!?</p><p><strong>Lionman:</strong> With my pure heart and my direct current, Lionman fights for children! For presents! For justice!!!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Justice!? Are you kidding me!? That&#39;s just blatant, self-serving commercialism!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Eternal Christmas might sound good at first, but people can&#39;t stay in paradise forever! They will always fall eventually!</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> He fights for children? Oh my, this is going to be tough, yes. Children love luchadors with animal masks.</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> It&#39;s so hard when two faces go up against each other. The audience never quite knows who to cheer for...</p><p><strong>Lionman:</strong> Oh yes, I almost forgot to activate the modifications I made to the ring. There we go.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Wh-what the!?</p><p><strong>Lionman:</strong> I switched out the ropes for something with a little more...spark. A direct current spark, to be precise! Dee see see see!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> A DC death match...!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Still, at least they&#39;re confined to the ring here.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> And that&#39;s got to be a disadvantage for her, since she&#39;s so big!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> She won&#39;t be able to use her massive size to overwhelm us without touching the electrified ropes herself...!</p><p><strong>Lionman:</strong> Did I mention I treated her entire outfit with a special insulant? She&#39;ll have no problem touching the ropes.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> .........Qu&#39;avez-vous dit!?</p><p><strong>Lionman:</strong> Deee see see see! How long do you think you&#39;ll be able to keep to the middle of the ring, given her massive size!?</p><p><strong>Lionman:</strong> It&#39;s only a matter of time until she has you up against those dangerous ropes!</p><p><strong>Lionman:</strong> Not to mention that the electrified ropes mean you can&#39;t use your aerial lucha moves!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> No fair!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That&#39;s fighting dirty!</p><p><strong>Lionman:</strong> It&#39;s called using your head!</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> So you&#39;re actually a heel in face&#39;s clothing! Well, we can&#39;t afford to lose to a team like that, no!</p><p><strong>Lionman:</strong> Dee see see, trash talk us all you like! My brains and her brawn will soon send you packing!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> I was a little shocked by this twist myself (not literally) but since Dark Kuku hasn&#39;t said anything, I&#39;m gonna give it the all clear for now!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> In the red corner, representing America, we have Lionman and BigBody! And in the blue corner, representing Chaldea, we have the Quetzal Sisters!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Now, on your marks...get set...die!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I think the American team meant to finish this...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...but when the Quetzal Sisters dodged out of the way, Bunyan, growing bigger by the minute, ended up running into Lionman...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...and now the ropes are electrocuting both of them...!?</p><p><strong>Bunyan:</strong> That tingles! Oh, but my shoulders were all stiff from cutting down trees, and I think they feel better now...?</p><p><strong>Lionman:</strong> This...this can&#39;t be right. My suit should be completely insulated from external direct current shocks...!</p><p><strong>Lionman:</strong> The only way this could happen is if...someone switched out my direct current for that infernal alternating current... Oh, now you&#39;ve done it...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m not quite sure how changing the current would affect his suit&#39;s insulating properties... But anyway, now&#39;s your chance!</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> You underestimated us! A true luchadora doesn&#39;t need ropes to pull off an aerial attack, no!</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> Bradaman, crouch down and put your hands together, please!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> I get it! You want me to be the rope and post for you! Okay, I&#39;m ready!</p><p><strong>Lionman:</strong> Dee see. (Wind knocked out of him) Impossible...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Good job on another win!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Yes, I&#39;m glad too. It helps that our opponents did some of the work of digging their own grave, though.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> ...? Is something wrong, Quetzal Mask?</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> ...No, it&#39;s nothing. I just felt like I&#39;d realized something very important for a moment...</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> Please, don&#39;t mind me. I was just caught up in my own thoughts, yes.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Anyway, these matches sure are getting tougher every round. Though I guess that makes sense, since they&#39;ve all had to be strong enough to make it this far.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> We were lucky this time, but we need to stay on our guard and keep training hard for the matches to come.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m glad you&#39;re so diligent.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You&#39;re a hard worker, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> I-it&#39;s nothing special. Any knight would do their best to secure victory.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> And I still have a long way to go, so I have to try extrahard to make up for all my shortcomings.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Please don&#39;t be so hard on yourself, Bradamante. I&#39;ve already learned a lot from you about being a Shielder.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I think it&#39;s wonderful how you&#39;re so dedicated to improving.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> I&#39;m just flailing around trying my best to catch up to where I should be.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> For example...back when I got captured by monsters because I wasn&#39;t paying enough attention...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> ...a true knight would have gladly chosen death over the humiliation of being taken prisoner.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> But I couldn&#39;t do that. Even when I told them to kill me, I kept trying to think of a way to turn the tables...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That...doesn&#39;t sound like you were doing anything wrong to me...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> ...You think so?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> ...Fooou?</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> Hm? Wait. Do you hear something?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Now that you mention it... Yes, that sounds like a child. They might be lost. Let&#39;s go check on them!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong> Ugh. Ugh!</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> I know how you feel, but please try to stay calm.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> It&#39;s unfortunate that we lost, but we fought as fairly as we could. You should be proud of that.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> All the more so given that our opponents resorted to base trickery and borderline cheating.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong> I-I know! But this stinks... You don&#39;t know how it feels, Sanson! You&#39;re too grown-up!</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> Oh, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s it. I&#39;m just good at finding the middle ground. Although...I wonder if Marie might be disappointed... Phew.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Hey there.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You guys must be the French team.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> Oh, hello, Master. I didn&#39;t know you were competing, too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I can understand Santa Lily&#39;s reasons, but I&#39;m a little surprised to see you here too, Sanson.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> I am indeed here. Though, of course, it is our little Santa here who is the team&#39;s heart and soul.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Thanks for the invitation! So you need a reindeer, huh. That sounds so fun! Would a glass horse work?</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> ...She was coming dangerously close to competing in this tournament, so I felt it was incumbent on me to volunteer in her stead.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong> Reindeer Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I didn&#39;t know you were competing as well.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong> Well of course I am! I&#39;m Santa, after all!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong> I can&#39;t let some im...imp...ipmonsters try to take over being Santa themselves!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong> An official Christmas has to have an official Santa! I&#39;m sure my mentor would say the same thing!</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> B-but I really did inherit this title from Altera, you know? I&#39;m as official as they come! Really!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong> That&#39;s what I heard...but I don&#39;t know. You&#39;re showing an awful lot of skin...and there&#39;s that whole samba thing too... (Staaare)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A-at any rate, you seemed pretty upset earlier. Is everything okay?</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> Yes, well, part of it is just the usual frustration that comes from losing a match, but–</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong> It would have been fine if we&#39;d lost fair and square!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong> But they cheated! They totally cheated!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Cheated? Well no wonder you&#39;re upset! That goes against everything we knights stand for!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong> Thank you, lady with the vaguely French color scheme!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> How did they cheat, exactly?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What was this team like? Where were they from?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong> Well–</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Whoa, whoa, whoa! What do you guys think you&#39;re doing!?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> It&#39;s a good thing I just happened to pass by and sense danger when I did!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Getting firsthand info about a team still in the running from a team they beat is purrhibited!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> No way this cat&#39;s letting that happen on my furry watch! Now go on, get outta here!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong> Hmph. I didn&#39;t see you caring that much about the rules during our match...</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> Just goes to show that the rules here can change on the organizer&#39;s whim.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> It&#39;s unfortunate, but since we didn&#39;t sign a contract to compete, there&#39;s nothing we can do about it.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> The best thing we can do is accept loss with some grace. By the way, when will we know the tournament&#39;s results?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> We&#39;ll be broadcasting the final match on every monitor here, meow. By that point, we won&#39;t need to bother keeping info about every team&#39;s secrets.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> I see. Then it will be worth staying around to cheer for the other teams.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> ...All right then, we&#39;d better take our leave, but we&#39;ll be praying for your victory.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong> (Pout)</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> Say, have you ever seen this? If you take a smooth, flat stone, and throw it at a body of water like so...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong> Wooow! Was that some kind of spell? Huh? Anyone can do it? Teach me! Teach meee! Pleeease!</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> Hehe, you&#39;re better with children than I thought, yes.</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> ...Very well, I hear you loud and clear.</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> I promise you we&#39;ll do our very best to win this tournament for your sake as well as ours, yes!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I still wonder who the other team was, though. The cheating must have been egregious for Lily to be that upset...</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> Well, it is natural to focus on the negatives when thinking back on a loss, yes.</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> So if you want to have a good, clean lucha, and respect your opponent one-hundred-percent even if you lose, your only option is to keep practicing diligent–</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> C-can we help you with something?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> There&#39;s so many of them! Maybe they want a selfie with us?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> I don&#39;t think so. They look like they mean business, and not the fun kind. Get back, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong> You the Quetzal Sisters?</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> We sure are! Did you come here to dance the samba with us?</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong> Nothing personal. We&#39;re just following orders.</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong> Don&#39;t worry, we won&#39;t kill you. We&#39;ll settle for an arm or a leg!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Orders...? You mean someone told you to do this? You should be ashamed of yourselves!</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> Well, at least this should make for a nice post-match cooldown, yes! Let&#39;s get them!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> ...And that&#39;s what happened, yes.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fooou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Given the highly suspect timing, I&#39;m guessing the team you&#39;re up against next must have sent them.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That would mean you&#39;re probably going up against the cheaters Santa Lily was so angry about... Good grief.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> So that&#39;s how Bradamante got injured...?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Ow ow ow... I&#39;m sorry I was so careless. Normally, I could handle opponents like that no problem, but I was still a little tired from having just fought a match.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> But it&#39;s okay. I think I&#39;ll be fine before it&#39;s time for the next match! And even if I&#39;m not, it would be unbecoming of a knight to complain!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Tha...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Tha?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> That does it! Now I&#39;m pissed!!!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> How dare they do this to my student–my friend! A little mischief is one thing, but I will NOT tolerate this sort of cowardice!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Oops! Silly me! I apologize for my unladylike behavior! Teehee...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I&#39;m a saint this time. A purehearted holy maiden. I won&#39;t be cracking my knuckles or sending dolphins flying. Nope.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> But even so...there are some things I just cannot simply allow to happen.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> R-right...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> ...All right, I&#39;ve made up my mind. If your next opponents are this unscrupulous, and you&#39;re starting at a disadvantage as well...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> ...something even worse could end up happening in the ring tomorrow. Something my fighting styles can&#39;t stop.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Eep! ...D-don&#39;t worry, Coach, I&#39;ll be fine! With you here teaching me, I&#39;m sure I can handle anything!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Effort alone won&#39;t solve this. And so...I&#39;m going to teach you something I never intended to.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;ll be able to use them, but I have to teach you all the same.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> It&#39;s time for you to learn the fifty-two fighting styles I sealed away for being too dangerous!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Fifty-two!? You mean you still have fifty-two more techniques I don&#39;t know about, Lady Martha!?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> My full fighting style has many different techniques. Unfortunately, some of them have...issues.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> At any rate, we only have a single day for you to learn these styles before your next match.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I don&#39;t know how much they&#39;ll help you to counter their dirty tricks, plus the training will be hard and grueling...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I won&#39;t force you, but I think knowing these styles may help you in the fight ahead. So...what do you say?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> I&#39;ll do it!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> That&#39;s the spirit! I couldn&#39;t ask for more from a partner than the determination to keep moving forward, yes!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Say, Martha, I don&#39;t suppose you could teach me too while you&#39;re at it, could you?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> No, I couldn&#39;t. There wouldn&#39;t be any point, since my styles would not mesh well with yours.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Besides, I think you already have everything you need.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> After all, it&#39;s not as though you faces only know how to fight clean, right?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Hmm, yes, I suppose you have a point.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I think I know what these “forbidden techniques” are now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It&#39;s okay, Martha. No matter what, you&#39;ll always be a saint.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Wh-what are you saying? Of course I will. Now, would you please stop looking at me like that?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Ahem. All right then, let&#39;s begin. Go ahead and get into the ring. And whatever you do, don&#39;t let your guard down.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> My forbidden Fifty-Two Street Fighting Moves are all ultrapractical techniques meant to be used in live combat.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Come at me with anything less than your best, and you WILL end up on the mat!</p><h2 id="day-4-oppressive-sadistic-nobility" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#day-4-oppressive-sadistic-nobility" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Day 4: Oppressive, Sadistic Nobility</h2><p><strong>Mysterian Servant No. 1:</strong> Oho? I see you are both still in one piece... I suppose I can only expect so much of hired amateur thugs. Though of course, I knew that going in.</p><p><strong>Mysterian Servant No. 2:</strong> Fine by me. Their bad luck is our good fortune.</p><p><strong>Mysterian Servant No. 2:</strong> Now we get the pleasure of whipping them into “shape” ourselves! Hohohoho!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Then...you WERE the ones who sent those attackers after us! You should be ashamed of yourselves!</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> I&#39;ll say. It doesn&#39;t matter what sort of underhanded moves you employ outside the ring. In the end, victory goes to the ones who train the most dil–</p><p><strong>Mysterian Servant No. 3:</strong> All&#39;s fair in love and war! And it is sometimes the tactics you employ off the field of battle that determine the winner!</p><p><strong>Mysterian Servant No. 3:</strong> Though in my case, I&#39;m happy so long as I get to run around free to do as I like.</p><p><strong>Mysterian Servant No. 3:</strong> But that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m gonna horse around! Just line them up for me, Commander, and I&#39;ll knock them down!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> A third fighter...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Oh come on, that&#39;s clearly against the rules!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> I totally get your objections, believe me, but there&#39;s a reason we have to let them compete, meow.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Take off those cloaks and show them what I mean!</p><p><strong>D：:</strong> Keh heh heh. No international competition is complete without the presence of the great China!</p><p><strong>E：Carmilla?:</strong> Let&#39;s see, was it ni hao? Ni men hao? Whatever it may be, my fellow countrywoman is correct.</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> Objeción! That one is obviously from Europe, no!?</p><p><strong>D：:</strong> Don&#39;t be ridiculous! This is my niece, Hua Meiluo! I hired–er, brought her along for her expertise in torture!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;d love to see the entry form for this...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Wh-what about, um, him...?</p><p><strong>Red Hare:</strong> I was told it would be good luck for them to ride me, Lu Bu Fengxian, during festivals and such! Makes sense to me, since I&#39;m just too strong to join the fight!</p><p><strong>Red Hare:</strong> I&#39;m here strictly as a vehicle, not a wrestler! I am a warrior out to become the strongest reindeer ever!</p><p><strong>Red Hare:</strong> Reindeer like me don&#39;t show up because it&#39;s Christmas! Christmas comes around because reindeer show up!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> A centaur!? Wait, never mind that. How can it possibly be okay to have a third member on your team!?</p><p><strong>D：:</strong> Don&#39;t be a fool. This man is my horse! Did you not hear it straight from his mouth?</p><p><strong>D：:</strong> If you mean to bar him, you would need to have the King of Knights and the King of Conquerors dismount from their steeds as well.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Now I REALLY wanna see your entry form!</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> Now I see. You have been exploiting loopholes in the rules to give yourself an advantage both in and out of the ring, yes!</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> You are certainly as underhanded as the little Santa said you were, but I see even that is not the whole story.</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> Underhandedness has become a core part of your arsenal, in every aspect of the fight.</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> So you are a ruda who is all about weapons!</p><p><strong>D：:</strong> I haven&#39;t the foggiest notion of what you mean, but I take it that is a compliment? Good! Then I must compliment you on your keen eye! Keh heh!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> But...I still don&#39;t understand. Why would you do all that just to win?</p><p><strong>D：:</strong> You need to ask? What are presents if not rewards! And who should dole out rewards to the commoners?</p><p><strong>D：:</strong> The most important person in the entire world, of course. And that is obviously the emperor!</p><p><strong>E：Madame Hua Meiluo:</strong> Did you know there is another Santa whose job is to hand out punishments instead of presents? I desire that job.</p><p><strong>E：Madame Hua Meiluo:</strong> I never dreamed there was a way I could dole out such punishment legally! Just you wait, naughty children!</p><p><strong>Red Hare:</strong> I don&#39;t know what all this Santa stuff&#39;s about. I&#39;m just here &#39;cause they said I&#39;d get lots of carrots if we win!</p><p><strong>Red Hare:</strong> Also I felt like I should serve an out-and-out tyrant like this at least once!</p><p><strong>Red Hare:</strong> Besides! I&#39;m Lu Bu! I can&#39;t betray my lord if I don&#39;t have a lord to serve. Not that I have any intention of betraying anyone, of course.</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> Maravillosa! That is all exactly the sort of thing I&#39;d hope to hear from a ruda! Now I can fight without holding anything back, yes! Let&#39;s go, Bradaman!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Right! Three against two or not, I&#39;m sure I can still manage to–</p><p><strong>D：:</strong> Oh yes, I almost forgot.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> And I thought three was pushing it!</p><p><strong>A：:</strong> Kehehehe! They are no more than equipment I use, no different than any other weapon. Surely you do not object to a fighter using weapons of her choice?</p><p><strong>A：:</strong> Now, let us have a good, clean, fair tag team match!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Man, this is confusing! What even is a tag team match anymore? Talk about it being a jungle out here!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> In the red corner, representing China, we have The Most Dangerous Team! And in the blue corner, representing Chaldea, we have the Quetzal Sisters!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> You guys can figure out who wins on your own, &#39;cause this cat&#39;s furred–I mean, fed up!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> I&#39;ve had my share of group battles before, but having to fight so many at once is such a pain!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Fighting in an open field would be one thing, but a ring is so confined. We need to find a way to turn the tables!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Hmm... Hmm...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Sorry, the only thing I can think to do is just look them right in the eye and appeal to their better nature!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> We knights are all about duels, after all, and that&#39;s not any less true in a duel of intellect! What do you say, everyone?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> If you&#39;d all be so kind as to line up in an orderly fashion, I&#39;ll show you all, one at a time, how brightly we knights can–</p><p><strong>H：:</strong> First, I have my Torturers occupy the ring&#39;s edges... And then, I turn the center into a poison pot!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Huh!? Hey! That&#39;s fighting dirty!</p><p><strong>H：:</strong> And now, for the finishing touch! Do it!</p><p><strong>Madame Hua Meiluo:</strong> Like this, right? You&#39;re not going anywhere.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh no! Now Bradamante&#39;s wrists are caught in the Iron Maiden&#39;s chains...!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fou!</p><p><strong>H：:</strong> After I surround you with Torturers, plunge you into poison, and hold you down with heavy chains, all that will remain is to look down at you from atop Red Hare!</p><p><strong>H：:</strong> I daresay there never has been, nor ever will be, a more perfect formation! Kehehehehe!</p><p><strong>Red Hare:</strong> Just so you know, I&#39;m Lu Bu, not Red Hare. Also, I have to say, actually carrying someone on my back like this is kind of annoying?</p><p><strong>Red Hare:</strong> With most empresses, it&#39;s like, “Wei? Wu? Shu? Jin? Aren&#39;t those lands all kind of small?”</p><p><strong>Red Hare:</strong> But with this one, it&#39;s like she came to power in a China that got rid of all those lands and clumped them together to form a much bigger nation... I dig it!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Khh! The more I struggle, the more these chains and the poison slow me down...!</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> Bradaman, if we don&#39;t do something drastic, we could end up losing! I&#39;m trusting you to turn things around!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Me? Why me?</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> You&#39;re the one dealing with those chains. They may be a burden, but they&#39;re also an opportunity. As long as you keep your cool...you know what to do, yes?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Okay! I&#39;ll give it my best shot!</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> Sí muy buena! Okay, see you soon!</p><p><strong>H：:</strong> What!? Why did she just let herself sink down to her shoulders?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Now she&#39;s going underneath Bradamante...and letting Bradamante stand on her shoulders!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;re using your own body as a platform!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What about the poison!?</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> Sí, this is a little rough without my full power, but I do still have my innate divine durability...</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> That said, I don&#39;t think I can last too long, no...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> So I&#39;ve got chains on my wrists, and enemies on all sides... This calls for one of the Fifty-Two Street Fighting Moves:</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> “The Time I Went to an Enemy Base to Settle Things Once and for All and Ended Up Fighting a Chain Death Match”!</p><p><strong>Madame Hua Meiluo:</strong> Huh!? How is she pulling me towards her...!?</p><p><strong>Madame Hua Meiluo:</strong> Is she more proficient in fighting with chains than I am!? There shouldn&#39;t be anyone these days who is!</p><p><strong>Madame Hua Meiluo:</strong> Very well then, I&#39;ll just have to trap her inside my Iron Maiden...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Ooh, I don&#39;t like the sound of that...!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Why me... I&#39;m just the...referee...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Bradamante used glare from her shield to throw off Carmilla&#39;s aim...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I feel bad for Jaguar Warrior, but at least Bradamante was able to take Carmilla down!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> First, I take down the opponent I&#39;m chained to as quickly as possible! Hyah! That just leaves the gang&#39;s leader!</p><p><strong>H：:</strong> She&#39;s headed straight for me now!? Hurry, Red Hare, get out of the way!</p><p><strong>Red Hare:</strong> Now that I think of it, tight places like this ring aren&#39;t a good fit for me, you know? I like wide open plains where I&#39;m free to run around That, and betraying my superiors.</p><p><strong>Red Hare:</strong> Even if I wasn&#39;t so into betrayal, I can&#39;t actually move at all with the Torturers crowded in so close. Sorry!</p><p><strong>H：:</strong> What!?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> ...We won, Quetzal Mask! Please, hang in there!</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> Olé... That&#39;s great to hear, yes... I&#39;m just a little worn out from staying in the poison so long...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Quetzal Mask!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fooou!?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> (Sniff, sniff) Now that I think about it, I really don&#39;t like dealing with poison so overflowing with curses and malice.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> That was always more that rat bastard Tezcatlipoca&#39;s thing.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Though I&#39;m sure I could have lasted longer in my original Spirit Origin.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Quetzalcoatl...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Oh, but don&#39;t worry, no! I&#39;ll be fine after a bit of rest!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I took a quick scan just to be sure.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Her Spirit Core&#39;s not going to be falling apart anytime soon, but her Spirit Origin&#39;s definitely taken some damage.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It&#39;s not clear how long it&#39;ll last, or what might happen if she doesn&#39;t stay put...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> All I can say for certain is that she needs plenty of rest.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I&#39;m glad the moves I taught Bradamante helped you win...but I never expected you to end up like this.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Since I&#39;m sure Bradamante can&#39;t bring herself to ask, I&#39;ll do it myself.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> ...Will you be able to compete in the next match?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> No sé... I&#39;m afraid I won&#39;t know until tomorrow.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Moping will not help, no! I&#39;m just sorry I can&#39;t dance a samba to cheer everyone up!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be fine! Just do what you all have to do and everything will work out, yes!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes... You&#39;re right. Between the post-match cooldown, recuperation, and preparing for the next match, there&#39;s no end of things we need to take care of.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> ...Okay, Quetzalcoatl, I understand. I&#39;ll be praying for your swift recovery!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> In the meantime, I&#39;ll take care of everything else that needs doing. Just point me in the right direction, Manager!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I can&#39;t say I&#39;m not worried...but we&#39;ll do the best we can.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> We&#39;ll get everything ready. You just focus on healing.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Right!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> I&#39;m sure everything will work out, yes. If things go really, really bad, I still have a trump card up my sleeve...well, ribbons.</p><h2 id="day-5-savagery-and-innocence-deceived" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#day-5-savagery-and-innocence-deceived" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Day 5: Savagery and Innocence Deceived</h2><p><strong>Martha:</strong> The match is coming up in just a few hours... How are you feeling?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> I&#39;m sorry... I think I still need more time...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Please, don&#39;t apologize. Honestly, I&#39;m sorry that I couldn&#39;t do more to help.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> If you were a normal human, I could have used a purification miracle to cleanse the poison...but since you&#39;re a god of this region, well...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> All right, I&#39;ll go tell Bradamante and Fujimaru you can&#39;t compete.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Hold on. It&#39;s just you and me here right now, yes?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Hm? Yes, I believe so. Bradamante and Fujimaru are both outside getting ready.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Perfect. You see, I still have one last idea. I think you&#39;ll understand if you see it for yourself.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Is that...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So she&#39;s still not up, huh...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I guess she can&#39;t compete after all...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Quetzalcoatl? It looks like you still need more time to let the poison run its course.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> I can&#39;t let you step into the ring when you&#39;re not fully recovered.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> I know I still haven&#39;t reclaimed my power...but I can&#39;t ask a friend and ally to sacrifice her life just for that.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> That would go against everything I stand for as a knight.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> So even if we can&#39;t keep competing together, that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m giving up.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> After I&#39;ve officially withdrawn, I&#39;ll find a new way to pursue my knightly duties. One where I can still hold my head high and–</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong> I feel better than ever.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fouwhaaa!?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Hm? Huh? That&#39;s strange...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> There&#39;s something different about you, but I can&#39;t put my finger on it!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Still, you&#39;re wearing a ring costume, and your mask... So you must be my partner...right?</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong> Different? Why would you think something&#39;s different?</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong> Can&#39;t you see what I&#39;m wearing on my head? Who could I be but Quetzal Mask!?</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong> Right, Master!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Oh yeah, you&#39;re a wrestler if ever I&#39;ve seen one.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You&#39;re such a natural, it&#39;s scary.</p><p><strong>E：Quetzal Mask?:</strong> Right? It actually scares me a little, too. But then, of course it would, seeing as we&#39;re both Rulers.</p><p><strong>E：Quetzal Mask?:</strong> Our whole existence is the passing on of ruling things, right? So I&#39;ve always been the Ruler of the ring!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>E：Quetzal Mask?:</strong> Pow, pow! Just look how nimble I am! You can see the poison&#39;s all gone and that I&#39;m in great shape, right!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Hey, that&#39;s great! I knew that shameful attempt to poison you would be useless against a heart so just!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> What is it, Lord Fou? I&#39;m always glad to hear anything a friend of Lord Merlin has to say.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> No comment fou.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I guess Bradamante is rather too pure to see what&#39;s going on.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I think it would be best if we didn&#39;t burst her bubble...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So, um, I hope you don&#39;t mind if I whisper here, but...are you serious about this?</p><p><strong>E：Quetzal Mask?:</strong> ...Y-yes, good point. Ahem. I guess I did get a bit carried away. I&#39;m calmer now.</p><p><strong>E：Quetzal Mask?:</strong> I asked her if she was serious too, Mash...</p><p><strong>E：Quetzal Mask?:</strong> But she just looked me right in the eye and said I was the only one who could do this.</p><p><strong>E：Quetzal Mask?:</strong> How could I say no to that? So I decided to set aside our religious differences and accept.</p><p><strong>E：Quetzal Mask?:</strong> As her friend, a Heroic Spirit, and a fellow woman warrior, I felt it was the least I could do.</p><p><strong>E：Quetzal Mask?:</strong> And, truly, the thought of having to forfeit because of something so vile and underhanded galls me!</p><p><strong>E：Quetzal Mask?:</strong> It would mean all the work I&#39;ve done as a coach would be for naught!</p><p><strong>E：Quetzal Mask?:</strong> So I figured cutting loose and engaging in a bit of mild shenanigans would at least be better than doing nothing.</p><p><strong>E：Quetzal Mask?:</strong> Heh... I guess Bradamante&#39;s tenacity must have rubbed off on me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You don&#39;t think anyone will catch on?</p><p><strong>E：Quetzal Mask?:</strong> Don&#39;t worry. No one else will figure out who I am as long as I keep this mask on!</p><p><strong>E：Quetzal Mask?:</strong> Quetzalcoatl was adamant that masks provide A-rank Noble Phantasm-level Identity Concealment in a lucha match!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> (I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s more everyone playing along than an actual effect...)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Still, are you sure it&#39;s okay to pretend like this? Especially coming so soon after all the cheating in that last battle?</p><p><strong>E：Quetzal Mask?:</strong> I asked Quetzalcoatl about that myself, and her response was, “Sometimes gods turn into things they&#39;re not just to mess with humans, yes!” So...I think it&#39;s fine?</p><p><strong>E：Quetzal Mask?:</strong> So on that note, you can call me New Quetzal Mask! Now that I&#39;ve recovered from being poisoned, I&#39;m back with many more punches and kicks than before!</p><p><strong>E：New Quetzal Mask:</strong> So please pay it no mind if my fighting style is completely different than it was before!</p><p><strong>E：New Quetzal Mask:</strong> I have to admit, it&#39;s nice that wearing this mask means I don&#39;t have to be so constantly focused on making sure I exude an aura of saintliness.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> I don&#39;t really get it, but got it! I&#39;ll make sure to follow your lead, especially since you only just recovered.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Just tell me what I can do to make it easier for you to fight!</p><p><strong>E：New Quetzal Mask:</strong> I will. Now then...let&#39;s go kick some ass!</p><p><strong>Mysterian Servant No. 1:</strong> Heh heh heh. So, you defeated the American team and the Chinese team, huh? Well that&#39;s nothing.</p><p><strong>Mysterian Servant No. 1:</strong> They may have been the most cruel and sadistic of the Four Heavenly Kings...but we&#39;re the wildest and toughest!</p><p><strong>Mysterian Servant No. 1:</strong> Get ready for the biggest twist in this whole event! Just be careful not to keel over from shock!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> We represent the animal kingdom! Mewhahaha, bet you never thought you&#39;d have to fight one of this event&#39;s officials!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> No, I had a feeling this was coming.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Expected it, actually.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> And this is my trusty partner. As soon as I saw her, I knew she was the one.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Just look at that wild boar on her shoulder! And that outfit! It&#39;s purrfect for wrestling!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll find a better warrior for the animal kingdom anywhere in the world!</p><p><strong>Atalante Alter:</strong> P-please do not stare at me. This was all her idea.</p><p><strong>Atalante Alter:</strong> She convinced me to join by pointing out that a never-ending Christmas would also mean never-ending smiles on children...but I just cannot get used to fighting for show like this.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> She seems more embarrassed to be here than anything...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> ...but the fact that this team made it this far means they must be much stronger than they seem.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> We can&#39;t let our guard down around them.</p><p><strong>E：New Quetzal Mask:</strong> Of course not. These are eminently worthy opponents.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Mewhahaha! Only “worthy”? Girl, we&#39;re this tournament&#39;s apex predator!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (She doesn&#39;t have a clue!)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (I had no idea masks really worked this well.)</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Bet you thought I was just Dark Kuku&#39;s tame house cat, didn&#39;tcha? Just thought I was an adorable, diligent kitten running around at her master&#39;s bidding!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> But all this time, you were blind to the secret truth...</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> The fact that we totally stole info about all our opponents!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s true... As the one leading all the different teams around, and carrying messages between them...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Jaguar Warrior would be able to enter each team&#39;s training gym without arousing suspicion.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That way, she could learn who each team&#39;s members are, their fighting style...all sorts of information that could give her an advantage in a tournament like this!</p><p><strong>E：New Quetzal Mask:</strong> I took you for a cat, but it seems you&#39;re more of a rat. Our last opponents were apparently not the only vermin scurrying around this place.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> I thought Black Quetzal Mask was trying to hold a fair, legitimate tournament.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Are you sure she would approve of you blatantly cheating like this?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> You know what makes wild animals wild? The fact that they&#39;ll do whatever it takes to survive!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Would you blame a chameleon for blending in? A opossum for playing dead? A sloth for being lazy?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> No, wait, scratch that last one. Those things actually die if they exert themselves too much.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Anywho!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Well, since Dark Kuku hasn&#39;t actually said anything about it all this time, I&#39;m pawsitive she&#39;s cool with it, meow!</p><p><strong>Atalante Alter:</strong> I have no interest in cowardice or honor. Survival is all that matters.</p><p><strong>Atalante Alter:</strong> Besides...I am sure there is a secret place where the results are revealed, or an illegal way to watch the matches.</p><p><strong>Atalante Alter:</strong> There must be, given that the people appear to be betting on them.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...What are you talking about?</p><p><strong>Atalante Alter:</strong> Children often come up to me whenever I am out in town lately.</p><p><strong>Atalante Alter:</strong> They ask for my autograph, or to shake my hand, or if there is any news of a figurine being made of me...</p><p><strong>Atalante Alter:</strong> I am told that Mexican children look up to strong wrestlers, so they must know that I am one.</p><p><strong>Atalante Alter:</strong> Hehe, you should see the way they smile at me... Hehehe...!</p><p><strong>Atalante Alter:</strong> Indeed, it is those smiles I fight for, and they are why I must keep winning! They are all that I need in this world!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> That&#39;s the spirit! Anyway, thanks to my little bit of subterfuge, my spying went purrfectly!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> I know everything about you! Your moves, your combinations, your weaknesses...everything!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> At this point, the Forest Fourth Dimension (that&#39;s our team name, bee tee dubs) all but has this in the bag!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> The Samba Counter Hold I came up with for this day is so tight you&#39;re gonna feel like your limbs are snapping!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> So go on, dance as much of your silly samba as you like! It&#39;s not like it&#39;ll do you any good, meow!</p><p><strong>E：New Quetzal Mask:</strong> ... (Silently raising fists)</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Uh, did you hear me? I saaaid dance all the silly samba you want...</p><p><strong>E：New Quetzal Mask:</strong> ... (Stepping in closer, fists raised)</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Huh? Orthodox karate with a super low center of gravity? What happened to the funky samba rhythm, meow!?</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> This isn&#39;t how it was supposed to gooo!</p><p><strong>Atalante Alter:</strong> What? Being overeager for victory can actually make children dislike you? That is...quite a conundrum...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The difference in New Quetzal Mask&#39;s fighting style really worked in your favor.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> In retrospect, getting poisoned might have been the best thing to happen for this fight.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!</p><p><strong>New Quetzal Mask:</strong> Hehe, we won because the Lord is with us. Why else?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Agreed! Though I have to say, you really surprised me.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> I had no idea you were so good at melee attacks, too... It was almost like watching Coach Martha!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> She still hasn&#39;t realized!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Talk about being pure of heart...</p><p><strong>New Quetzal Mask:</strong> She really does take people at their word, doesn&#39;t she... Um, is it just me, or does she actually seem holier now?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> The whole time!? No way!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> I feel totally fine after taking a day off to rest, yes! I can even dance a samba at one-hundred-twenty-percent power!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Thank goodness. I&#39;m so glad you&#39;re back to your old self...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> No need to fill me in. I can tell how the match went just from your mood. Felicidades! Congratulations on your victory!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> But, why does Bradamante look so glum even after you won?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> She&#39;s still reeling from learning that New Quetzal Mask was actually Martha all along. Not to mention...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Is it wrong that we won with a secret substitute? I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s what a holy knight should do...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> As long as you weren&#39;t disqualified for cheating, then it doesn&#39;t count, no. If it did, we&#39;d never have moves like poison mist or be able to use corkscrews during bouts!</p><p><strong>G：Martha:</strong> Just so you know, I had my reservations about this too, okay? I even said no at first.</p><p><strong>G：Martha:</strong> But if Quetzalcoatl told you “Surely Saint Nicholas would want you to fight in a mask to protect his honor, yes!”...</p><p><strong>G：Martha:</strong> ...wouldn&#39;t you be inclined to agree with her too?</p><p><strong>G：Martha:</strong> Besides, we can&#39;t let the true Santa power fall into the wrong hands and sully Saint Nicholas&#39;s name. That&#39;s the most important thing here.</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> Cowardice is always a matter of perspective.</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> If winning will serve justice, and losing allow injustice, then winning is all that matters.</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> I&#39;m certain even you have fought battles in the past where you didn&#39;t always loudly proclaim who you were at the outset.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Well, yes, that&#39;s true... Wait, who are you again?</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> Ho ho ho. It&#39;s me, Santa Senior.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> She came to pay me a visit, yes!</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> I had joined this tournament on behalf of western Asia, but unfortunately, I ended up losing.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Didn&#39;t you say it was against the rules to have the same Santa two years in a row?</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> Well, yes...</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> But if I had successfully gained the true Santa power, then I would be Neo Santa. Completely different.</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> Surely no one could take issue with me repeating a year if I underwent a drastic change of image, right?</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> Anyway, it wouldn&#39;t be any fun to just pack up and leave now, so with that pesky feline out of the way...</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> ...I thought this would be a good chance to come see you again. And to get a look at Charlemagne&#39;s niece.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Hm? You know His Imperial Majesty?</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> Ho ho. Maybe, maybe not. Certain things about my relationships are complex and difficult to define.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> R-right...</p><p><strong>G：Martha:</strong> Anyway, now that we&#39;ve won, all&#39;s well that ends well.</p><p><strong>G：Martha:</strong> And with Quetzalcoatl back in action, my stress relief–namely, being guilted into being your ringer–is over.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> While I wish I could welcome you with a pot of my famous stew...I&#39;m afraid we just don&#39;t have time now.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Between Quetzalcoatl&#39;s fighting instinct rehab and our strategy meeting for the next match...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> ...there&#39;s just too much else on our plate. I&#39;m sorry.</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> Stew, huh... Too bad. I would have loved to try some. (That&#39;s all right. Santa doesn&#39;t get hungry.)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Uh, Santa Senior? I think you got your inner and outer voices mixed up.</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> Oops! How silly of me. Ho ho ho.</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> I&#39;ll be glad to sample your stew some other time. More importantly, I need to warn you about your next match.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You mean you have some info about our opponents in the semifinals?</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> Not exactly. Then again, maybe I do?</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> This is really just a feeling... Call it sheep&#39;s intuition.</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> Your next match will be the sixth in this tournament, the semifinals.</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> The last hurdle to overcome before presumably facing off with Black Quetzal Mask in the finals.</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> They&#39;re bound to be the most skilled team in the tournament. It&#39;s not that I doubt you, but I expect you&#39;re going to have a hard time against them.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> It doesn&#39;t matter how skilled they are! We can handle anything!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Between Quetzalcoatl being back in action, the fighting styles Coach Martha taught me...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> ...Manager-slash-trainer Fujimaru&#39;s top-notch support...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> ...and Lord Fou&#39;s sheer adorableness–</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> What I&#39;m trying to say is, I don&#39;t think that will be enough.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> What do you mean?</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> It&#39;s simple. If what you have right now isn&#39;t enough, then you need something more.</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> And I&#39;m certain you already know what that is.</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> Surely it must have crossed your minds at least once or twice before.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Can you just tell us what you&#39;re talking about?</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> All right. What you lack...</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> ...is a killer finisher.</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> And unless you can come up with one...you will struggle to win your next match. Ho ho ho...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fi</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> nish</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> her!?</p><h2 id="day-6-a-killer-technique-and-a-chilly-ring" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#day-6-a-killer-technique-and-a-chilly-ring" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Day 6: A Killer Technique and a Chilly Ring</h2><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> A killer finisher, huh... I love the sound of that. It has its own unique flavor, even different than a Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> I&#39;ll admit, I was a little jealous whenever I saw the others double-teaming us...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (So honest!)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (I know what she means...)</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> So I welcome this challenge! I&#39;ll endure any training it takes to learn our own killer finisher, no matter how harsh!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> I mean, I might have a little difficulty with being trapped and abandoned in an illusory garden, or other trials of mental fortitude...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> ...but I&#39;m great at physical obstacles, like climbing out of deep pits! I&#39;m a lot tougher than I look!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Don&#39;t worry! I think this will probably play more to your strengths, yes!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> We&#39;ll use these big trees I just pulled out of the ground as training dummies.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Think of the trees&#39; roots as your opponent&#39;s feet, and their branches as arms.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Got it!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> So the idea is to float the dummies down the river, and land the move on them when they go down the waterfall.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Very well. I&#39;ll take care of that part of your training.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Muchas gracias. Now, as far as actually developing this move goes...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> I see... So we need to land the move on the dummy, all without succumbing to the waterfall&#39;s intense pressure.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> And not only that, we have to do so at exactly the same time...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Okay, let&#39;s do it! We may not have much time, but I&#39;ll do whatever it takes to make sure this new move is ready by our next match!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Be careful you don&#39;t get hurt.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Let me know if there&#39;s anything I can do to help.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Thank you, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou fou!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> I can feel all your expectations riding on me.

That move of theirs was really something else.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> I honestly didn&#39;t think the kinda stuffy Chaldea team would be able to beat their next opponent...</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> ...but meow I&#39;m wondering if we might just possibly see an upset...</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fochoo! ...Fo, fou...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It looks like it&#39;s snowing a lot harder there right now. Are you guys gonna be okay?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s almost like it&#39;s gotten colder to demonstrate how harsh this match will be...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Don&#39;t worry. No snowstorm can extinguish the fires of justice that burn within the hearts of true and just knights! Besides–</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> It looks like we&#39;re up against a couple of particularly large luchadors, yes.</p><p><strong>Mysterian Servant No. 1:</strong> Large? You are wrong there. If anything, you should be honored that I deigned to make myself so small.</p><p><strong>Mysterian Servant No. 2:</strong> ...(Nod)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...!?</p><p><strong>Mysterian Servant No. 1:</strong> We have come from the freezing lands of Russia to dominate this tiny ring.</p><p><strong>Mysterian Servant No. 1:</strong> I could squash you where you stand, but in my infinite generosity, I choose not to. You will have to forgive me for the blizzard; that, I could not leave behind.</p><p><strong>Mysterian Servant No. 1:</strong> Regardless, now that I am here, you have but three tasks: count your blessings, bow your heads before me in fear, and place your shoulders on the mat until the count of three!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s...Ivan the Terrible! He&#39;s as big as they come! I never expected to see him here...!</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Do not be so surprised.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> This battle&#39;s victor will gain the power to make Christmas eternal–and with it, bring winter everlasting.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Thus, if Santa Claus is the ruler of endless winter–the universal symbol of ice and snow...</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> ...then I, the tsar, am the rightful Santa!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...!?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fo!?</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> As such, the answer is clear. The true tsar is the one who should possess the true power of Santa Claus.</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> It must have been a lot of work, finding a golem to be your partner! Was there no one big enough for the job?</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> Sí, one of the best parts of lucha is facing opponents with ring names like “El Grande” and “El Gigante”!</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> But bigger is not always better, no!</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> A foolish notion. You think my partner a mere golem?</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> ...Mammoth Tusk!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Huh!? Why did he stab the golem with that huge tusk!? Did they have a falling-out before we got here?</p><p><strong>H：Golem???:</strong> ...Heh. It seems you aren&#39;t familiar with masked wrestlers wearing more than just one mask.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Wh-what are you talking about?</p><p><strong>H：Golem???:</strong> I encased my body in this icy form on our way here because it was SO GODDAMN HOT!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> The golem&#39;s body just shattered...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You mean Anastasia was inside all along...!?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Ivan and I aren&#39;t exactly on great terms, but we decided to put aside our differences just for this tournament.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> I too heartily agree that the Russian tsars are the rightful heirs to Santa Claus&#39;s throne.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> And since our interests align, here we are. Sure, his eyes are kind of...okay, very scary, but I can deal with them.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> And so, history&#39;s two strongest tsars came together to form a dream team to achieve their mutual goal!</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Oh, and we don&#39;t answer to Black Quetzal Mask. We&#39;re one of the Four Heavenly Kings because we&#39;re just that strong.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Just to be clear.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> In my Russia, we need not concern ourselves with who shall be the reindeer. That role will go to Old Man Frost–Ded Moroz.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Anastasia could have been Snegurochka, the snow maiden, of course, but–</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> That would have been a bit on the nose, especially since I&#39;m already very similar to her in general.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> They don&#39;t seem like the most well-coordinated team, but their noble demeanor belies tremendous confidence.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> They would probably even give Charlemagne a good run. We definitely can&#39;t let our guard down around them.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Do not underestimate us, knight of old France. Viy is here with me, and the imperial family has long been proficient in the art of self-defense.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Besides, I&#39;m actually stronger than I look. My strength may only be rank E, but there are any number of ways to make up for that.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Why don&#39;t we go ahead and show them what I mean, Your Terribleness!</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Very well!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh!? It looks like...Anastasia is wearing Ivan the Terrible like an upside down backpack...!?</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> This move demonstrates our glory and shows the world what tsars are made of!</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Try this on for size. This is our invincible move...</p><p><strong>Anastasia &amp; Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Mammoth Tusk Train!</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> Dios mío! Get out of the way, yes!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Aah!</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> So you dodged it. Good. The match is no fun if you can&#39;t put up a decent fight.</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> That speed... They must be using wintery magecraft that lets them remove the friction from their feet, yes!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That would mean they&#39;re basically ice-skating around. Pretty clever.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> So that&#39;s how they charged at us so quickly.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> I&#39;m guessing they&#39;re also using magecraft to help the girl carry the big guy on her back...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> But then again, Stolfo sometimes pulls off feats of Monstrous Strength even in that skinny body of his...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> ...so maybe she&#39;s just really strong, regardless of what her Strength rank might be.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Hey, I haven&#39;t even rung the bell yet! Ah well! You&#39;ve already started, so can&#39;t stop it now!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> In the red corner, representing Russia, we have The Tsar Missioners! And in the blue corner, representing Chaldea, we have the Quetzal Sisters!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Now, let the first match of the semifinals...begiiin!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> They&#39;re still so fast! I thought they&#39;d be at least a little slower now, but they just keep going, yes!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> And not only that... Ngh!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Just look how hard they hit, even when they barely touch us...!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Their sheer mass is incredible. Colliding with them feels like getting hit by a train!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> And trust me, that hurts like hell! I mean, I&#39;m pushing through the pain, but still!</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Heh. You make an astute observation.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> My size and strength do not merely come from the power of the tundra, but of the entire earth. I am the Great Tsar after all...</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Enemy though you may be, I must commend your judgment, and your shapely rear end, young wrestler. Come see me after the match, and I will gladly shake your hand!</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> ...I would love to throw the “Great Tsar” off this pyramid now, but I will refrain. Now is the time to endure.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> I am willing to endure any humiliation for the sake of mischief–ahem, victory. I&#39;ve even tried listening to rock music lately, though I can&#39;t say I understand the appeal.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> My point is...you may be dodging our attack now, but you can&#39;t keep that up forever.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> The Mammoth Tusk Train has no brakes.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> I&#39;ll spare you the actual calculations, but the force of our charge exceeds ten million tsarpower.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> At best, you two have no more than one million tsarpower each. Numbers don&#39;t lie. You have no chance of winning.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a real unit of measurement...!)</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> Hmm. So far, we&#39;ve been able to dodge by keeping to the samba beat...but that&#39;s only going to run us ragged, yes.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> No... No, I refuse to accept defeat! I&#39;m not going to lose now!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Even if they are stronger than us...we can more than make up for it with sheer willpower!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> My willpower has gotten me through all sorts of tight spots before. My faith in justice...in my king...has always been rewarded.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> There&#39;s no reason this time should be any different! As long as we stay focused and keep on fighting, I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll find a way to win in the end!</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Your fortitude is both admirable...and pitiful.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> No matter the willpower an ant demonstrates, it can never threaten a mammoth. It will always and only ever be an ant.</p><p><strong>Anastasia &amp; Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Mammoth Tusk Train!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Ghh! I won&#39;t let you win...I refuse to give up now! I can&#39;t afford to lose after coming this far!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Let&#39;s do it, Quetzal Mask!</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> ...Are you sure? We may have started to get the hang of it in our training, but it&#39;s still far from complete.</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> It&#39;s usually not a good idea to use moves like that in circumstances this dire...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Maybe so, but it&#39;s our only chance of winning!</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> ...I can see how serious you are about this. Okay, let&#39;s do it, yes!</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Hm? What are they up to...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Quetzal Mask put her hands together, and Bradamante is on top of them like she&#39;s getting ready to jump...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I knew it! They&#39;re getting ready to execute the new move they&#39;ve been practicing!</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> I am both the foundation and the launchpad! First I jump with all my might...</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> ...then I throw you, as a present, with all my gift-giving power!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Then I jump at the same time as hard as I can, turning myself into an arrow!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> My magical shield becomes the arrowhead. This is a very elaborate sort of shield bash, really!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Granted, I feel like I may have already been doing something similar up till now without realizing it...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> ...but this time, I&#39;m going to focus on converting all my shield&#39;s defensive power to offense!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This move is a combination of Quetzal Mask&#39;s present drop...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...and Bradamante&#39;s shield-based charge attack!</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> Try our new move... Bouclier Present Drop, yes!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Montjoie! Gooo!</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Ridiculous. A tsar never shows their back to an enemy. I forbid you to dodge, Anastasia.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> I know. It doesn&#39;t matter what sort of attack they try. Nothing they do can surpass our ten million tsarpower.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> We will crush them head-on!</p><p><strong>Anastasia &amp; Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Mammoth Tusk Train!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> They&#39;re gonna collide!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Which move will win!?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> (I can tell that their move is still incomplete. I can already see how this will play out...!)</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> (I&#39;m fully aware the odds are stacked against us! So if I&#39;m going to perfect this move...it has to be now!)</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> (How can I push it farther!? What else can I do to make it more powerful!?)</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> (...I&#39;ve got it!)</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Quetzal Mask has passed her power on to me! If you add hers to mine, that gives me two million power!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> And since I&#39;m jumping with twice as much force as usual, that&#39;s two times two million, giving me four million power!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Then, if I spin with three times the force, that&#39;s a total of twelve million power–enough to surpass you two!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Well, if we leave the odd math aside, this is amazing! Her body is glowing like an arrow of light!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> As a shield-wielder myself, I think I might just be witnessing a legend in the making...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> H-how&#39;d it turn out...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> The smoke is clearing... Who won!?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fo... Fooou!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Everyone is sprawled out in the ring! Even Quetzal Mask, who used up all her strength for the throw!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Who&#39;s going to stand up first...?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Nnn... Viy&#39;s eyelids are...so long... Ahh, it&#39;s like...the stars are spinning... So...rocking...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Anastasia is down for the count! That just leaves–</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Impressive... You have managed to give even this tsar of the icy tundra chills. Such insolence is unprecedented in all of history. You should be proud of your accomplishment, criminal though it is.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Your move was fearsome indeed. But alas, it lacked polish. Had you perfected it, you may well have defeated me...but instead, you only succeeded at breaking one of my tusks...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> N-nnn...</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> To reward your prowess, I will end you myself. It will be as though you are enclosed in Russian mountains.</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> On the count of three, you will fall deeply asleep, and your long hibernation will begin...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Aah! He&#39;s about to fall on top of her! Wake up, Bradamante! Wake up!!!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> The only one taking a nap here is you!</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Gah! My eyes!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> I knew you had to have eyes somewhere in that huge head of yours!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Allow me to explain my ultimate move.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> It&#39;s not a move I like to use, since it doesn&#39;t exactly cast me in the best light...but never mind that! I call it...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Playing possum!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> N-now that I think of it...I think I did read something about this in one of the legends of Charlemagne...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> That&#39;s right. This is the same move I used during my battle with the evil sorcerer, Atlante.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> But that&#39;s not important right now! What IS important is that this is as far as you go, Ivan the Terrible!</p><p><strong>Ivan the Terrible:</strong> Impossible! I am the tsar! I am meant to be the victor!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Montjoie! I did it!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Congratulations! Now that you defeated those fearsome opponents, you&#39;re officially moving on to the finals!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Amazing job, you two!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fou fooou!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Wow, even I never expected we&#39;d have to rely on our barely completed new move to get through that match!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> It&#39;s like I told you: I have a knack for coming through when it really counts!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Boy, it&#39;s a good thing that other Santa came to give us advice. Otherwise, we&#39;d never have come up with that move.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> I wonder...maybe she was actually Lord Merlin in disguise?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Preeetty sure that&#39;s not the case...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Anyway, it goes to show that knights who walk the path of righteousness receive just the advice they need!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> As long as we believe our path is right, and keep on fighting no matter what, I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll win the next match, too!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Still...your final opponent is definitely going to be her, right?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> That&#39;s true, yes. We&#39;ll be up against the other Quetzalcoatl...another me with her own divinity.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Since she is the side of me that is devoted to battle, she&#39;s bound to have quite the advantage over us in terms of raw power, yes.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Don&#39;t forget that the first time we fought, she overwhelmed me with strength alone...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Yes. The same thing happened to me when I went up against her.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> ...But that doesn&#39;t matter!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> We&#39;ve both grown a lot over the course of this Santa Tag Team Tournament. And now we know we have got ourselves a new move as well!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> There&#39;s no way we can lose!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Entendida, yes! There&#39;s not a luchadora in the world who steps into the ring expecting to lose, no!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> It&#39;s wonderful you&#39;re so fired up about this. What more could I want.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Still...I have to wonder about her partner.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Given that this is a tag team tournament, Black Quetzal Mask must have a partner of her own.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Right. While it&#39;s possible her partner is only there to fill the team quota, we should expect them to be quite a powerful force unto themselves.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Assuming this partner is a capable Servant, I can&#39;t help but wonder what sort of person they are.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I suppose it is a little unnerving that we have no information about them whatsoever.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I&#39;ve been looking into the earlier matches, and her partner has never so much as set foot in the ring.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> They must have kept their cloak on while Black Quetzal Mask won the matches by herself.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> She might be having her partner save her strength...or could there be another reason we don&#39;t yet know...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> ...Well, if we don&#39;t know who this mysterious partner is, there&#39;s no point in prying any further.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Besides, a moment ago, we didn&#39;t even know she had a partner. Now we do! That&#39;s all we need to know, yes!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> If this partner does not fight in the final, then we will have a clear advantage! And if they do show up, we can always try to take them out first!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> That makes sense, given that these are tag team matches.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> But anyway, even if we do only have one last match, our task is unchanged!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Train hard, and make sure we&#39;re in good condition for tomorrow! Oh, and make sure we perfect that new move of ours too!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Bring it on!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> As your manager, I&#39;ll do the best I can to finish strong, too!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Oh, right...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Since this will be our last match, that means this will also be the last chance I get to practice with you, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> I can already tell I&#39;m going to miss this time when it&#39;s over...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> But I&#39;m getting ahead of myself. We still have a big match to win first, don&#39;t we!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> And I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be able to devote myself to training, knowing you&#39;ve got my back!</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> Hehehe. So, the day has almost arrived.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> The day this festival–this tournament–must come to an end...so that I can stay true to myself.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> Although...</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> ...Hehehe. Don&#39;t worry, you still won&#39;t be going out there.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> Though you will be on the sidelines for this match as well, know that the reasons will be quite different.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> Up till now, I have kept you on the sidelines simply because I didn&#39;t need your help to win.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> But this next match will be different. Given who our opponents are...</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> ...your stepping into the ring would obliterate any chance they have of winning.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> This is the final, after all. We can&#39;t have it ending too quickly.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> If you do get a turn, it will only be at the very end, to fully break their spirit. And when the match is over...</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> ...that count of three will mark the birth of the true Santa Claus, and the beginning of Christmas everlasting...</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> Hehehe. Mwahahaha. Mwaaahahahaha...!</p><h2 id="day-7-the-black-mask-and-santa-claus" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#day-7-the-black-mask-and-santa-claus" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Day 7: The Black Mask and Santa Claus</h2><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So, this is it.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Yes. These last seven days have somehow felt both as if they went on forever, and flew by in an instant.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> But either way, one thing I know for sure...is that they&#39;ve been tremendously fulfilling for me.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Even with my pride and power stripped away, I&#39;ve been on a new journey ever since you gave me that bread without seeking anything in return.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Thank you, Fujimaru. I can&#39;t tell you how grateful I am.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> That goes for all of you too. Mash, Lord Fou, Coach Martha...

No...something I need to say.</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> I&#39;m sure none of you have forgotten, but it&#39;s my fault this whole mess happened in the first place.</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> I&#39;m so sorry you&#39;ve had to go this far to help me clean it up, Master. And...thank you.</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> I promise I&#39;m going to settle things today, and make sure we all get a proper Christmas.</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> And put a stop to this ridiculous spectacle the other me came up with.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> (I can&#39;t help but wonder...how proper can Christmas really be when it&#39;s being led by a samba Santa?)</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I&#39;ve taught you everything I can.

Pay close attention to how it feels to step over the ropes.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> Because when we are done here, only one team will have a chance to step back over them.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> That will be the team worthy of obtaining Santa Claus&#39;s true power.</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> One thing is clear after coming this far.</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> You have been pouring the magical energy released during this tournament into the Christmas Grail, strengthening it.</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> That&#39;s why this tournament will result in a more Santay Santa than ever before. It has nothing to do with the Christmas Grail&#39;s power.</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> That can only mean you planned this whole ordeal from the start. Why? Why did you want to do this?</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> Want to? I didn&#39;t WANT to do this! Given who I am, this was something I absolutely HAD to do!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> I have no idea what this is all about, but I do know these fighters are both ready and raring to go!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> And at this point, this jaguar actually couldn&#39;t care less which of them wins!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> The only thing on my mind right now is the stack of delicious meat I was promised for services rendered once this is all over!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Look, Quetzal Mask. She really did bring a teammate.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> They&#39;re standing perfectly still, which just makes them creepier. We should keep an eye on them, too.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I&#39;m not picking up much from them actually... In fact, I&#39;m not even sure they&#39;re a Servant at all. Hmm?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Maybe it&#39;s just a golem she brought in to fill the other slot on her team...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Just don&#39;t let your guard down.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Let&#39;s just focus on the match at hand.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou fou!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Of course. A good knight never lets down her guard. I&#39;ll put everything I have into this fight, and make sure we come away with the win! Montjoie!</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> I&#39;ll dance my heart out to make sure we win too, yes!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Only a week has passed since they last faced off...but things couldn&#39;t be more different now.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I know you two can win this!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> In the red corner, representing Mexico, we have the Black Quetzals! And in the blue corner, representing Chaldea, we have the Quetzal Sisters!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Win or lose, laugh or cry, it all comes down to this final match! Let&#39;s get ready to jingllle!!!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> ...? That should have done a lot more...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> I know Black Quetzal Mask is an experienced fighter, but something doesn&#39;t seem right.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> My attacks seem to be landing okay, but it&#39;s almost as though yours are being repelled...</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> Hehe. Hehehe. Took you long enough to figure it out.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> This is no trick. The simple fact is that you cannot possibly beat me in a real fight.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...! If this is what I think it is, then...that&#39;s just ridiculously unfair!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Do you know what&#39;s going on, Da Vinci!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Well, we all know that the original Quetzalcoatl is a god of good.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But now that there are two of them, well...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...I think the simplest explanation is that they are manifestations of the good and evil sides of Quetzalcoatl, who is inherently good.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> So if the original Quetzalcoatl&#39;s innate goodness is shared by both of these Santa versions...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...then it isn&#39;t possible for the good Quetzalcoatl to hurt the evil one.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Quetzalcoatl has never been able to be harmed by anything good, remember?</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> As a Servant, I would never demonstrate my superiority over all good unless there was a big reason to.</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> It&#39;s still technically a part of me, but it&#39;s not usually something I use, no.</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> And naturally, now that I&#39;m split in half and don&#39;t have my proper Spirit Origin, I couldn&#39;t use my superior goodness even if I wanted to.</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> But it looks like there&#39;s just one exception to the rule: myself.</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> I can&#39;t deny the goodness inherent in me...even if it belongs to my wicked other half.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Now what do we do...!?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> So what? No, really! So what!?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> This is a tag team match, and I&#39;m your partner. Just because you can&#39;t defeat her doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Come on, Quetzal Mask, there&#39;s no reason to hold back now! Let&#39;s finish this with our new move!</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> ...You&#39;re right! Your attacks should work fine. Okay, I&#39;m counting on you now more than ever, yes!</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> The one thing our move lacked...was rhythm. Sí, my passionate rhythm is an essential part of this me!</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> I can&#39;t forget about that if I&#39;m to entrust you with all my power!</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> So this time, I&#39;m going to launch you in time with my samba rhythm...like this!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> ...That&#39;s it! We&#39;ve finally perfected our move... Neo Bouclier Present Drop!!!</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> Huh!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s even stronger than when it defeated the Russian team! That&#39;s got to be more than enough to win!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> No, it&#39;s not over yet.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...She&#39;s getting back up!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Huh!?</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> ...I see. That is quite the technique. I actually felt threatened for a moment.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> Bradamante, of the Twelve Paladins of Charlemagne, you have earned my respect.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> My other half alone may be no match for me, but the two of you together are indeed a worthy foe.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> You have earned the right to face me at my full strength. How unfortunate for you that you were unable to finish me in a single strike.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> It&#39;s over. You can blame yourselves for devising a technique that forced me to stop holding back.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Come on, Quetzal Mask! If we do it again, we can–!</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> You will never get another chance! Come forth, my partner!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> She&#39;s finally unveiling her mysterious partner! Just what sort of fighter are they...?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fo...!?</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> Is that just...formless power...?</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> It is Santa Claus.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Huh!?</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> My partner here is the very concept of Santa Claus, extracted directly from the Christmas Grail.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> Of course, my partner and I have a combination move of our own...even if it only amounts to me wearing it like a cloak.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> This Santa is nothing like your silly samba, which wouldn&#39;t even exist had it not been for your airheaded mix-up.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> I finally have the power of the true Santa Claus. The true...Dark Santa.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> And so, fair knight, Bradamante...I am now impervious to your attacks as well!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> She didn&#39;t even feel it...!?</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> I will tell you once more: your attacks will no longer work on me. Why, you ask?</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> Santa Claus is a giver of gifts, not a target to be attacked. The very concept protects me now.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> A Santa Claus this pure can only be defeated by a Santa Claus of equal purity!</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> Hmm. Yes, that tracks. (Completely clueless)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> B-but, all the Santas we&#39;ve seen before have been–</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> They were the results of Servants forcefully altering their Spirit Origins. Not one of them had the purity I am speaking of!</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> That, of course, goes for you as well, you absurd samba goddess.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> Now that I am armored by this pure concept of Santa Claus extracted directly from the Christmas Grail...</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> ...only a Santa Claus concept of the same purity can ever hope to touch me!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Okay, it is important to me that you know everything she just said sounds completely ridiculous. Even so, none of your attacks are touching her!</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> Of course they aren&#39;t. Everything I have said is absolutely true.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> Infusing this tournament&#39;s magical energy into the concept I wear has created the true Santa Claus.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Th-there&#39;s no way something so absurd could be–</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> It&#39;s the truth.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Waaaaaah!?</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> Aaah!</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> Now do you understand? You&#39;ve lost any chance you may have had at winning.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> Quetzalcoatl can never defeat me as I am now. The only one who would stand a chance is another pure Santa.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> Bradamante and Quetzal Mask, you have already lost. All because you chose to team up with one another!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fou fou, fooou!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Th-this is awful. She&#39;s just...whaling on them...</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> This is...very bad, yes. The samba rhythm is...fading...away...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> (Huff, huff)</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> You can take a lot of punishment, but you must be reaching your limits. This is Lucha Libre. Giving up is always an option.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> What did...you say...?</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> Never, no! We&#39;re still–</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> Standing in the ring? Not for much longer.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Quetzal Mask!</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> Giving up now means that you recognize me as the true Santa Claus.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> It is tantamount to making a wish upon me; an act that will be to your benefit as much as it will mine.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> Needless to say, I will be happy to grant your wish. I am the true Santa Claus, after all.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> Go on. Think back to that day–the day when you lost your power. Say now what you tried to wish for back then.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> (My wish...?)</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> (Well, I wished for world peace, of course...)</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> (And...if possible...)</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> (...to find Ruggiero...)</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> Why do you hesitate? You were the first to appear before me, so why shouldn&#39;t I grant your wish?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Huh? What do you mean...?</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> I first turned samba to grant wishes. It was only afterwards that I split off as the evil side in charge of fighting.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> This means that my essence lies in granting wishes...through battle.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> That is why I created this tournament. What&#39;s more, I did so not only for my sake, but for yours as well.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> As a holy knight, I believe you were drawn here by the Christmas Grail.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> I... Maybe I was. But what does that have to do with–</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> It has everything to do with this. No wishes can be granted until somebody makes one.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> Without you, I would not be able to grant any wish at all, even as the true Santa Claus.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> The fact is, you came here to have your wish granted. There is no need to hesitate. Everything you want can be yours.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> Accept me as Santa, and admit defeat. Bow your head in prayer, and tell Santa what you want for Christmas!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> I... I...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> I want...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> ...to find who I&#39;m looking for myself, by doing what I know is right.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> ...What?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> If that was too hard to understand, then I&#39;ll put it another way.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> I am a knight, so I want to find who I&#39;m looking for by walking a path I can be proud of.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> That path may be long, and arduous, and muddy...but I think that&#39;s exactly why he would be happy to see me.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Sure, I could take the easy way out and just let people find him for me in no time flat.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> I could abandon chivalry, and my partner, admit defeat, beg for help, and catch up to him in disgrace...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> But that would never prove my love for him!</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> I...I heard you, though. Didn&#39;t you wish to be reunited with him, back when you first saw the Grail!?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> All I was asking was, “Please watch over me while I do my best myself!”</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Getting advice is one thing, but I don&#39;t want or need to be spoiled by someone giving me gifts! Santa of all people should know that!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> And in case you forgot, my main wish was for world peace! If you want to grant that one, go right ahead!</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> Wha... How foolish. Absurd. Now your wish will never be granted, and you will both lose for nothing!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> We haven&#39;t lost yet, and we&#39;re not going to! As long as we never give up, things will work out somehow!</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> Ahh... That was preciosa.</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> You refuse to abandon your knightly honesty...</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> ...and you are not so foolish as to resign yourself to defeat in the name of hollow pride.</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> You simply keep your head high and never stop working towards victory, no matter what.</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> I couldn&#39;t have chosen a better partner, no!</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> After all, if you&#39;d given up now, the idea I just came up with to turn this around would be wasted.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> An idea to turn this around!? That&#39;s just what I wanted to hear! What do I have to do?</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> You? Nothing. It&#39;s what WE have to do!</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> If I can&#39;t defeat her myself, and Santa is the only one who can, then the answer is simple.</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> We make a new, non-Quetzalcoatl Santa right here, right now!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Wh-what is this!?</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> It&#39;s my Santa Power, yes! Go on and take it! It&#39;s all yours, yes!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You can just hand it over that easily!?</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> It&#39;s shameful of me, really. We&#39;ve been together this whole week, and I still hadn&#39;t given you a present.</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> So now I&#39;m making up for it by giving you the best Christmas present I can, yes!</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> Khh... No, you&#39;re wasting your time. You&#39;re just a pale samba-obsessed imitation of Santa. Whatever power you have won&#39;t be nearly pure enough!</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> You can give her every drop of your Santa Power, and it still won&#39;t be enough to damage this pure San–</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> You might be right...if it were only me doing so.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> She may as well have called all of us imitation Santas. If it is a fight she wants, then a fight she will have.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> And just as I had gotten my hands on a twelfth plate of nachos.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Whoa! A-are you sure about this?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> I am only lending it to her. Once she is done, I will make sure to reclaim it.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> But, how&#39;re you gonna get it to her from here?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> I will throw it to her through this television, of course. There is nothing Santa cannot do. Take it, Bradamante.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:</strong> ...I should do my part, too! Here! A present from Santa Claus. I promise it&#39;ll be reeeally useful, &#39;kay?</p><p><strong>Altera Santa:</strong> Ho ho ho. Very well then, this will be our little secret.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Wow!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Your Spirit Origin changed!</p><p><strong>D：Bradamante:</strong> So this is...the power of Santa...?</p><p><strong>D：Bradamante:</strong> I don&#39;t know about that, but I do know my body feels superlight! And I&#39;ve even got my armor back!</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> Impossible! Those are only fragments of Santa!</p><p><strong>D：Bradamante:</strong> This sort of thing has happened to me before. Maybe I&#39;m just blessed.</p><p><strong>D：Bradamante:</strong> So many kind people have helped me out... They&#39;re the reason I&#39;m able to keep moving forward, no matter what.</p><p><strong>D：Bradamante:</strong> I never forget how much I still have to learn, but I will continue on anyway. That&#39;s who I am.</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> (Hehe. Maybe it is because she is always moving forward that makes people so willing to help her.)</p><p><strong>D：Bradamante:</strong> So thank you, Santa Clauses! I promise I will use this power for justice!</p><p><strong>D：Bradamante:</strong> And by that, I mean that just this once...I&#39;m going to be Santa Bradamante!</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> !!!</p><p><strong>D：Bradamante:</strong> Get ready, Black Quetzal Mask. I&#39;m about to give you the Christmas present you really deserve... Defeat!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> Ghh...</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> Why are you doing this? Even if you win, you would never become the true Santa Claus.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> That&#39;s true. But as long as this whole ordeal ends and I get my power back, that&#39;s good enough.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Really, when you stop and think about it, it&#39;s awful that all this snow has fallen in Mexico. Christmas or not, there must be so many people who&#39;ve had their lives disrupted by all this.</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> I will be happy if I can just go back to being a regular Santa Claus, yes.</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> I have no interest in becoming the “true Santa” and keeping Christmas going forever, no.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> Then you will end up with nothing.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> The true Santa Claus&#39;s eternal Christmas would be paradise on Earth. You might even encounter the one you seek there.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> That&#39;s possible. A paradise might just be enough to draw him in...</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> Then why would you refuse!?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> That&#39;s easy. It wouldn&#39;t be real.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Besides...I meant what I said about how I didn&#39;t want to be spoiled with gifts.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> I know I have my weaknesses, and if someone started spoiling me, I&#39;d end up wholly dependent on them.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> I&#39;m drawn to the idea of paradise, too! But I can&#39;t go around chasing illusions just because they seem like they&#39;d be nice.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> ...!?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> ...If I flit around too much, I might end up losing what I&#39;m looking for before I can even find it.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> That sort of thing has happened way too many times before...so I decided not to let it happen again.</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> (...What an amazingly earnest knight you are...)</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> (You are completely aware of your weaknesses, and only let them motivate you to work harder.)</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> (That&#39;s somehow...comforting. Seeing her is like seeing the dazzling beauty of human imperfection.)</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> ...It&#39;s over. Oh! But, seeing as I&#39;m Santa Claus now, and it certainly is the season, maybe I should say...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Merry Christmas!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> It&#39;s over! This long and grueling battle is finally over!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> The winners of the Santa Tag Team Tournament are...the Quetzal Sisters!!!</p><h2 id="epilogue-the-snowy-ruins-and-the-girl-knight" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#epilogue-the-snowy-ruins-and-the-girl-knight" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Epilogue: The Snowy Ruins and the Girl Knight</h2><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> ...So I lost, huh.</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> I know you&#39;re the side of me devoted to combat, which is why fighting was the only option you had.</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> But it&#39;s over now. Come back where you belong.</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> What about the Christmas Grail?</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> I&#39;m already a god turned Santa. That present would be much too rich for my blood.</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> Besides, Santa is supposed to give presents, not receive them, no.</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> So how about we just give Bradamante back her original power, leave the Christmas Grail in Master&#39;s hands...</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> ...and enjoy a nice, normal, samba Santa Christmas?</p><p><strong>Black Quetzal Mask:</strong> Hmph. Oh, very well. If nothing else, I have to admit that the tournament is over.</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> Sí! I do feel bad about inconveniencing all the others, but the one thing we can both agree on...</p><p><strong>Quetzal Mask:</strong> ...is that nothing beats a heated lucha match! Sorry everyone, that&#39;s just how we gods are, yes!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> ...Phew. It&#39;s really over now, isn&#39;t it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You were amazing!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Congratulations!!!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Thank you, Fujimaru. But I genuinely couldn&#39;t have done it without everyone&#39;s help.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Thank you all so much!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Thank goodness. For a while, I was really worried about how things were going to turn out...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Hehe, I never had any doubt.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Thinking back on it now, maybe you never needed my coaching in the first place.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I&#39;m sure you two would have had no trouble winning on your own power alone.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Don&#39;t be silly, Coach Martha! I&#39;m especially grateful to you!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> I honestly don&#39;t know how I could possibly thank you enough for your help...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fooou!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Of course I&#39;m grateful to you too, Lord Fou! Your adorableness, fluffiness, and nebulous resemblance to Lord Merlin have been a huge boon!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Merfou? Fou. Fo fou, fou.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hey guys, check out the sky.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Hey, yeah. The sunshine is already melting the snow.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Now the people here will finally get to enjoy a normal Christmas...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Oh? Maybe not entirely normal.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fo!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s snowing again!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Wh-what&#39;s going on!? I thought Black Quetzal Mask was responsible for the strange weather!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> If it&#39;s still happening even after you beat her...does that mean the real mastermind is–</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> No, no, nothing like that.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> This is real, actual snow, yes.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Huh?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> It is just a little fluke of nature that happened to give Mexico snow for Christmas.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> It&#39;s also a present from the sky, offering its blessing to the warriors after their battle.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> What I mean is, it is a miracle, yes!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I see... I guess things like this do just...happen sometimes.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I hate to rain, well, snow on your parade, but this isn&#39;t the first time Mexico has gotten snow, you know.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That said...as timing goes, this is definitely kind of miraculous. I won&#39;t deny that.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Not to say I couldn&#39;t come up with a plausible scientific reasoning for all this, of course!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> For example, maybe all that sweat that flew off the fighters&#39; bodies somehow ended up forming snow clouds!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Well... I guess this is goodbye.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll just go back to the Throne, or continue my journey somewhere else...but I have to keep looking. It&#39;s who I am.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> We&#39;ll miss you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> So it&#39;s finally time to disband the team, huh...</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Still...you never know.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Maybe our paths will cross again one day.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> So...maybe I&#39;ll get to see you again.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> That&#39;s true. That could very well happen.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> If we meet again, you may have forgotten my fighting styles, but I&#39;m sure your soul will remember.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> You and I will always be comrades in arms. If you ever need my help again, don&#39;t hesitate to ask.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Thank you, my wonderful partner. Next time, I&#39;ll be sure to make a mask for you too, okay?</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> O-oh, uh... Thank you...?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> May you be blessed wherever your path takes you. I say that not as a goddess, but as a friend.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Ahaha, I appreciate that. If you had blessed me as a goddess, I know I&#39;m just immature enough that I&#39;d have ended up depending on it too much!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong> Okay, no more sappy goodbyes! From here on, I&#39;m sending you off with a happy samba rhythm! Olé!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Hehe, thank you. Okay, everyone... Actually, I think this will work as a farewell, too.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> After all, I WAS Santa Claus for a while!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Okay, everyone... Merry Christmas!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Merry Christmas!</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> ...What a beautiful sight. Ah, Ruggiero...if only you were here to see this with me.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> I hope that one day...I&#39;ll get to tell you all about this snow that fell on an ancient pyramid out in the jungle.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> Then again, maybe you&#39;re seeing it too, even as I speak, wherever you are. It wouldn&#39;t be the first time we&#39;ve unknowingly passed each other by, after all.</p><p><strong>Bradamante:</strong> I bet that one day...this will all be another story we laugh about together...</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Okay, that&#39;s enough of that, meow. There&#39;s still cleanup to do!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Even after she&#39;s gone, Black Kuku&#39;s still running this jaguar ragged. But this cat&#39;s gotta do her job if she wants to get paid!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Guess I&#39;ll start by taking down this tournament panel. Hup, hup... Phew.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Oh, come to think of it, we never did the whole thing where we give the winner flowers, did we?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Guess I&#39;ll just have to break out my official Jaguar Stamp of Approval instead.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> There we go. Gotta say though, we sure had a ton of teams compete, didn&#39;t we...</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Of course, ours was still the wildest, and the most popular! Remember, winning isn&#39;t everything!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Okay, what&#39;s next on the old to-do list... You know, as hard as I&#39;ve had to work, I think I might need to invoice Kuku for triple the meat she promised...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Some panels are soon forgotten after their role has been fulfilled. Some are engraved with records detailing the battles that were fought there.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> With no one left to look at them, there is no way to tell what they say.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Who competed in this tournament? Which teams fell to which opponents?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Which heroes took to the ring for the African team? At this point, nobody knows.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Of course, even if the young knight had seen the name she was searching for there, she may have just said:</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> “I didn&#39;t even notice! So there was actually another miracle at work here, huh. Too bad I missed him.”</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...and laughed it off.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> She would certainly not lose heart so much that she would abandon her search. Such despair would not even enter her mind.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> While she does wish to see him again, her feelings will remain the same, whether she finds him or not.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Because she knows their love will endure forever...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> In the meantime, the young knight in love trusts in her feelings, and her sense of justice...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...and continues to put one foot in front of the other, regardless of what lies ahead.</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div><footer class="page-meta"><div class="meta-item edit-link"><a class="external-link meta-item-label" href="https://github.com/r-grandorder/wiki/edit/main/src/Events/2020/christmas4.md" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" aria-label="Help us improve this page!"><!--[--><!--]--> Help us improve this page! <span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewbox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span><!--[--><!--]--></a></div><div class="meta-item last-updated"><span class="meta-item-label">Last Updated: </span><!----></div><div class="meta-item contributors"><span class="meta-item-label">Contributors: </span><span class="meta-item-info"><!--[--><!--[--><span class="contributor" title="email: 65916237+enshael@users.noreply.github.com">enshael</span><!----><!--]--><!--]--></span></div></footer><!----><!--[--><!--]--></main><!--]--></div><!----><!--]--></div>
