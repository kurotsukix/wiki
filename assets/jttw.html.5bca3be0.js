It&#39;s an ancient manuscript, like an old book. We call it a scroll.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Oh, how I love the smell of old books. They really have luster. (Sniff Sniff)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ah... So that&#39;s your fetish, is it...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Excuse me. My questions were an invasion of privacy. From now on, I promise to ignore what I see.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> No, I&#39;m not some kind of bibliomaniac, okay!? I was asked to bring it from the warehouse, so I did.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> This was an item brought into Chaldea and kept there because it was thought to be a precious artifact affiliated with a certain person.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That means it is a catalyst for summoning. You said you were asked. So, was it for some kind of experiment?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> No, this was an unreasonable favor from a certain painter at the workshop\u2014 Oh hi, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Good morning, Senpai. ...You&#39;re dressed a bit flashy, aren&#39;t you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> The party is here, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Party? ...Here? I don&#39;t think any have been planned...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You were probably given the wrong information. ...Let&#39;s interrogate Caesar later.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> In that case, what kind of smell do you like, Mash?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Which part of the conversation did you hear!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Let me see... Although I am still young and inexperienced, there are still smells I love, or I want to fall in love with.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The smell of soil, the smell of green pastures, the smell of fresh-baked bread. Fou, you smell a little like sunshine.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> And, well, when I&#39;m in your room, Senpai...sometimes... I feel dizzy...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Hmmm? I&#39;m sorry for interrupting your conversation, but something is off. Somehow the system started by itself...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...? I assumed that you were making preparations for a summoning. But you&#39;re right, something is strange\u2014</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> This setup is completely backwards\u2014 Leonardo! What kind of joke are you trying to pull off!? Stop the experiment now!</p><p><strong>Announcement:</strong> Unsummon Program, start. Due to an exception in processing, Coffin support is refused.</p><p><strong>Announcement:</strong> Spiritron Conversion, start. Rayshift starts in 6, 5, 4...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Get away from there, Mash! You too, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai, please come over here! It&#39;s dangerous!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s weird, Mash! For some reason, I can&#39;t move!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You really should have a good talk with Da Vinci sometime.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> !?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Where am I?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;m stuck...between these rocks... I can&#39;t move!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> Looks like you&#39;ve regained consciousness. Are you okay?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> Where is this, you ask? This place is north of Loulan, west of Hami. It lies at the border between the Great Tang Empire&#39;s realm and Gaochang.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> We are at the foot of the Five Elements Mountain, where the peaks seem to be able to reach heaven. And you are under some heavy-looking rocks.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Huh? Under the rocks!? Help me!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> Of course, I&#39;ll help you right away! ...But you seem surprisingly okay? Oops, spoke too soon... Why is your face turning pale?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> Oh. Sorry, sorry. I didn&#39;t mean to tease you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Is this some sort of kinky play?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> Huh? ...Well, with composure like that, you&#39;re obviously no ordinary person. Still, you don&#39;t look like a demon to me either.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> ...Yes! I need to make up my mind!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> I&#39;m certain that you must be the one that I&#39;ve been looking for. The Buddha must have brought us together!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> My name is Xuanzang Sanzang. \u2014What about you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m a Master from Chaldea Security Organization.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Chaldea? Master? Hmmm... And you say your name is Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Yo, I&#39;m !</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> I love energetic disciples! ...Oops, you&#39;re not my disciple yet.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Okay, Fujimaru. First, let me get you out of there. Behold the blessing of the Buddha!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> aryavalokitesvaro bodhisattvo gambhirayam prajnaparamitayam caryam caramano vyavalokayati...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> ...Are you okay? Did you get hurt? Do you want me to get you some bandages?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m perfectly fine.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> \u2014I see. I&#39;m so glad! So? I bet you see me in a different light now, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Everything is a bit foggy right now...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> That&#39;s concerning. Okay, let&#39;s take a little break!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll feel better while we talk. Speaking of which, it&#39;s time for my preaching!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> All right! Now, let&#39;s start over.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Let me introduce myself. I&#39;m Xuanzang Sanzang. Despite how I look, I&#39;m a monk. A proper monk that follows the teachings of the Buddha.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> I&#39;m currently in the middle of a journey to the far western land, Tianzhu, under the decree of the emperor of the Tang Dynasty. As for my mission... Ummm...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> To get the precious scriptures?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> What, how do you know? Oh no, I guess I was showing too much of my virtuousness...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> \u2014That&#39;s right, just like you&#39;ve said!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> To collect...seven...dragon orbs?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> You mean to materialize the wish granter that could fulfill any wish by offering the blood of those seeking it?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Too bad, I won&#39;t be swayed by such an easy temptation. But, you&#39;re on the right track\u2014 Yes, I am collecting something.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> As for what I&#39;m collecting...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Scriptures! I have a duty to collect scriptures! Scriptures that can be found on the way to Tianzhu! But...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> The demon I&#39;ve subdued to guide me ran... I mean got separated from me. And my horse got eaten... I mean I gave it a break.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> I&#39;ve been lost... I mean fighting by myself for days and then... I ran into you! I was so scared...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I see. Very virtuous.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Maybe it was too soon for you to travel?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> What? You got a problem with a virtuous monk like me!?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> By. The. Way. Isn&#39;t it about time you tell me about yourself?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> ...I see... Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Incinerated Earth... Singularities with Holy Grails... Guardians of Humanity...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> It&#39;s all rather grandiose and hard to believe, but... you&#39;re Fujimaru of Chaldea, which is from the future...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> I believe your story. This must be part of the Buddha&#39;s guidance... I&#39;m sure.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> The Buddha exists beyond space and time. He could send a messenger from the future to the past.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> So, how do you go back to Chaldea? Don&#39;t you have any tools to send an emergency signal?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Actually, no.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> You&#39;re lost! Oh my, so you&#39;re lost too! Good, good, we&#39;re rather alike, you and I!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> ...Ahem. I mean, uh, now I know the reason behind our encounter, Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;m still not sure that I traveled to the past</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Then again, you can&#39;t pinpoint your exact coordinates right now. In that case, we&#39;re just wasting time sitting here arguing.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> When I become great, I will say this: Do good deeds, punish bad deeds, and listen to Sanzang.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> So, Fujimaru? Become my disciple!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Why?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Uh... I mean... I&#39;m...still in the middle of the journey... And I&#39;ve got a long way to go...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> I&#39;ve got no food... My tummy is beyond empty... But all worldly things are transitory... Anyway, I need a disciple!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> If you will make me your number one disciple.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Of course! Easy peasy! You are my number one disciple! Yay!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> ...To tell the truth, I remember a little bit. I think I&#39;ve experienced this journey to Tianzhu once before.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> But I can&#39;t remember the specifics. Just like you don&#39;t know left from right here.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> It&#39;s very strange, but this must be some kind of meaningful fate for the both of us.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> This journey to the west is a trial from the Buddha. So he won&#39;t give you an answer. He won&#39;t do anything.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Most likely there&#39;s a reason for this. To send you back to Chaldea\u2014</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> That&#39;s the challenge I was given. For you, it&#39;s a gift from on high.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> So... From now on, you can call me \u201CMaster\u201D!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> \u201CMaster\u201D is taken, so... Mentor!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Ugh, I feel like I&#39;ve been called that before... No, you must properly address me as Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Don&#39;t overdo it, Sanzang-chan.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Ugh, just so you know, I won&#39;t take a rebellious pupil like you to nirvana!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Anyway, scriptures won&#39;t just fall into our hands. Come, let&#39;s head to the land in the far west, Tianzhu! GO WEST! GO!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Hey, Fujimaru! Are you here?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai! Master! Please answer me!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> This is not good. [\u2642 He /\u2640 She] must have moved. It will be hard to figure out the exact coordinates again...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Doctor! Can you at least send me to the coordinates where Senpai is!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;m trying to figure out why [\u2642 he /\u2640 she] got transported right now. It would be so much easier if we knew.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;ll do my best, of course. But I&#39;m sorry, Mash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai...</p><h2 id="volume-1-kingdom-of-tartars-along-on-the-journey" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#volume-1-kingdom-of-tartars-along-on-the-journey" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Volume 1: &quot;Kingdom of Tartars: Along on the Journey&quot;</h2><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> It&#39;s coming back to me now! I had three disciples!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Say, disciple! Do you happen to know about my past disciples?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Are they a monkey, a pig...and a kappa?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> A kappa? What&#39;s a kappa? No idea what that is... Kapa, kapapa...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> A black panther, a puppy, and glasses.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> You mean, a dog, a monkey and a pheasant, right? Huh? Why do I know that...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Anyway, speaking of monkeys... Sun... Sun Wukong! My reliable number one disciple!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So you had pupils before?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Oh... I&#39;m sorry. I did say I was gonna make you my number one disciple, huh? My bad.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;m going to pretend I didn&#39;t hear anything.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> ...Thank you for your thoughtfulness. You&#39;re so kind, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> But there&#39;s no need to worry! I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll remember why I lost my disciples during our journey.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> But this is a problem. A huge problem, perhaps.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> I&#39;m on a journey to Tianzhu, but I wonder why Sun Wukong isn&#39;t here.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Not just Wukong... But the other two pupils too... That&#39;s right, Zhu Bajie and Sha Wujing are not here either...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> This must be a message from the Buddha, too. I mean, journeys are always so mysterious!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> The new number one disciple will take care of it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You have me now, right?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> ...W-Wait a minute, what am I getting so flustered for!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> I&#39;m impressed that a new disciple like yourself can think like that! But that&#39;s prohibited here.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> As a disciple, you must follow the Buddha&#39;s teachings and worship him. Be careful not to brag too much.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> The law of the jungle applies to the journey to Tianzhu. If you are not careful, you will be eaten by demons.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> But... well... considering the hardships we&#39;re going to face, having another disciple or two would be reassuring...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> For example... Zhu Bajie...</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong> Oink, oink.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> !?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Oink?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong> Oink, oink. Oink!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> ...What is this!? I&#39;m hearing the squeal of a poor piggy...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Could it be Zhu Bajie!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It came from the other side of the rocks...</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong> I&#39;m oink. Very oink!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Oh, David, it&#39;s YOU!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Yeah, he&#39;s a pig. Definitely.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> His name is... David? Just like Fujimaru, he was underneath a rock!</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong> No, no. I&#39;m the cool Zhu Bajie. ...Well, here, at least. That&#39;s how things seem to have turned out.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Fujimaru&#39;s friend? Then he&#39;s a member of Chaldea, too?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> A pig? But you&#39;re a shepherd...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Just ignore him...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> No more indecisive attitude! Anyway, I&#39;ll rescue you from there right now!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> aryavalokitesvaro bodhisattvo gambhirayam prajnaparamitayam caryam caramano vyavalokayati...</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong> I&#39;m saved... Thank you! I couldn&#39;t do anything by myself. I thought I was going to become a monster&#39;s dinner.</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong> Right, but the situation was about to get much worse.</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong> I was starting to feel good about being squished. Whew, that was a close one, oink.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Ah... You saved him...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> This guy can have fun anywhere, huh?</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong> It was truly painful! I want to emphasize that part! I mean, I can sue for damages later!</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong> No, let&#39;s refrain from talking about that now. So you are Xuanzang Sanzang... As beautiful as rumored.</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong> That dress is so beautiful and perfect for a wedding. Were you expecting this chance meeting?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Huh? This is an important kasaya given to me by the Buddha.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> ...Ummm, don&#39;t confuse it with a wedding dress, okay?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Are you going to ignore the fact she&#39;s basically a nun?</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong> Why? There&#39;s no problem, right? Anyway\u2014</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Too bad, but she&#39;s ordained. She&#39;s not Abishag.</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong> Not Abishag? NO?! Such a waste! Well, anyway\u2014</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong> It&#39;s true her beauty makes me want to eat her up!</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong> Hi, my name is Zhu Bajie David. Oh beautiful lady with long black hair, I will gladly become your disciple.</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong> Actually, there&#39;s another one stuck under the rock who&#39;s fit to be your disciple. He got involved in the same fashion as me.</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong> I guess calling out for help is just too much for his pride.</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong> Jeez. Pride won&#39;t earn you a penny, oink.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You should have a little bit more pride...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Do you know the word \u201Cshameless\u201D?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> We&#39;ll talk later! Show me where he is! We don&#39;t want the rock to crush him!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong> You have my gratitude for releasing me from this prison. My name is Li Shuwen, an assassin not worth mentioning.</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong> It seems here I will be known as the third disciple, Sha Wujing... You may refer to me as so from now on.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Master Li, are you sure?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Becoming a disciple that easily?</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong> Well, what&#39;s the difference between Servants and Chinese opera actors? It matters not.</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong> How am I supposed to refuse the wish of a highly respectable monk? That aside\u2014</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong> It&#39;s such an honor to meet the Xuanzang Sanzang whom I grew so fond of from the fairy tales I read when I was young.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> You don&#39;t need to praise me like that... I&#39;m the one who should thank you. I hear you are a renowned master of the spear. How reassuring!</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong> Of course. I will behead as many enemies as you&#39;d like and offer you their heads just to serve you well.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> ...B-Behead!? Heads? No, no, no! That&#39;s so unsettling! Don&#39;t kill for no reason! It&#39;s prohibited!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Oh no... We&#39;re surrounded!?</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong> It looks like the monsters we got rid of earlier have returned, oink. They brought their buddies to share their food they found in the wasteland.</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong> It&#39;s just been one thing after another. But we can&#39;t let them eat us without a fight.</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong> Is it all right, my master? This is self-defense, not some unnecessary killing.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Th-That&#39;s fine, go ahead, Sha Wujing! But try to disperse them first...</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong> Understood. And how interesting. You&#39;re more virtuous than the Xuanzang I&#39;ve read about!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong> Now then. We can&#39;t let Master walk on this long, difficult journey. We disciples are one thing, but she&#39;s another.</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong> Do you want to ride on my shoulders? I don&#39;t have a ponytail, unfortunately, but... Oink.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Uh, I wholeheartedly refuse. However, I do wish we had someone to carry our luggage... Hmm?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> There is something running wildly over there...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That big red body... Is it a horse?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Red? Can it be...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> The Tartars of this land are known for breeding great horses! Can we bring one over here?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> If that&#39;s your wish!</p><p><strong>White Dragon Horse:</strong> [[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]\u2013!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> ...Let&#39;s go home. There&#39;s nothing here. NO WEST.</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong> That&#39;s Lu Bu. Yup, Lu Bu. So the fourth companion is that fierce warrior.</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong> I see, instead of the famed Red Hare, we get its rider instead. Well, it should not pose a problem for us. My master, please take a ride.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> No! I can&#39;t, I can&#39;t! This horse is scary\u2014!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Whoa there! Whoa!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What&#39;s in his hand? A scroll...?</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong> ...Hmm?</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong> Despite your appearance, it seems you&#39;re quite meticulous. You&#39;re carefully guarding that, huh?</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong> [\u2642 Brother /\u2640 Sister] Fujimaru? Why don&#39;t you show that to the master?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> ...Th-This is... the lost scripture! You were protecting it by yourself in this wasteland?</p><p><strong>White Dragon Horse:</strong> [[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]\u2013!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> I&#39;m so sorry that I screamed. You are an amazing attendant, and an amazing horse!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> It&#39;s scary, but it&#39;s part of my training! Oh magnificent red horse, lend me your shoulders!</p><p><strong>White Dragon Horse:</strong> [[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]\u2013!</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong> On his shoulders!?</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong> Wait! There was an option to ride on my shoulders too, oink!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Hey, actually, this is nice. Are you used to letting people ride on your shoulders?</p><p><strong>White Dragon Horse:</strong> [[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]\u2013</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong> I&#39;m used to it, too!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> What? The monsters had this scripture? And there must be more?</p><p><strong>White Dragon Horse:</strong> [[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> ...Strange, very strange indeed. Also, Zhu Bajie, you need to shut up.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> ...My mind is clearing as I read this scripture... Was that how they work? Oh well...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Sun Wukong! Sha Wujing! Bad Bajie! This is my commemorable first order!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> We, the Sanzang crew, will collect the scriptures on our way to Tianzhu!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> If you have any objections, I won&#39;t get mad, so come forward!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> I&#39;ll put this golden headband around your head and start preaching! I&#39;ll make you change your mind! No one shall go against me!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I guess refusal is not an option...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Is Sanzang possibly... a demon herself?</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong> Kaka! That&#39;s the great Sanzang I know!</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong> She defeats every evildoer that stands in her way... even those who have reformed! A flawless beauty that troubled even the heinous three!</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong> Fujimaru, let it go. This is the real Sanzang. You can&#39;t escape this fate.</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong> We have no choice but to accompany her on this journey. Well well, this is getting interesting!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So that&#39;s the kind of person she is!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Must collect... scriptures!</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong> I don&#39;t think this is interesting, oink!</p><h2 id="volume-2-flat-peak-mountain-the-attractive-demon-sisters-of-the-lotus-cave" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#volume-2-flat-peak-mountain-the-attractive-demon-sisters-of-the-lotus-cave" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Volume 2: &quot;Flat Peak Mountain: The Attractive Demon Sisters of the Lotus Cave&quot;</h2><p><strong>Golden Horn:</strong> Silver Horn, it seems like this fearless, pitiful Tang monk has stepped into our territory: the Lotus Cave.</p><p><strong>Silver Horn:</strong> Golden Horn, it seems like this cute and delicious-looking Tang monk was lured in by the aroma from the Flat Peak Mountain.</p><p><strong>Golden Horn:</strong> If it&#39;s a man, let&#39;s melt him all the way to the bone. Taunt him, torture him, and then swallow him. Isn&#39;t that right, Silver Horn?</p><p><strong>Silver Horn:</strong> Yes, Golden Horn. However, if it&#39;s a woman, let&#39;s welcome her warm-heartedly, play with her, befriend her, and then slowly drink her dry...

Are you out shopping?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Are we in the past?</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong> Are you asking if we Rayshifted to the era when Sanzang was alive?</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong> Well, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case, [\u2642 Brother /\u2640 Sister] Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong> We&#39;ve spent many days here already, yet you didn&#39;t see that ring of light in the sky, right?</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong> However, a constant supply of magical energy is needed for us Servants to exist. That supply is coming from somewhere right now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Are we in the world of \u201CJourney to the West\u201D?</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong> Now, if you say you are being forced to play in the drama \u201CJourney to the West,\u201D then there is no place for us to be here.</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong> There should be the real Sun Wukong, Zhu Bajie, and Sha Wujing right next to our master. What&#39;s the point of recreating the play with her alone?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> ...Ugh.</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong> My master. Do you have any ideas? Didn&#39;t you feel something by getting the scripture?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Yes... I remembered one thing.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> I don&#39;t know why, but... I dismissed my disciples, Sun Wukong and the others.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> All three have left my side.</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong> ...I see.</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong> Did you lay them all off when they fulfilled their terms? Restructuring, eh? How cold and unsentimental.</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong> But I won&#39;t denounce my master. Because you can&#39;t be a manager unless you are realistic.</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong> Well, I wouldn&#39;t let them leave if it were up to me! They always say, \u201CMake a pig fat, then eat it,\u201D right!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s true, oink.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> When are you getting fat then, oink?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Hmmm... You may be right... That&#39;s why they&#39;re not with me right now...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Don&#39;t get so depressed.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll be back again sometime.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Do you really think so...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> ...That aside, I&#39;m not feeling good right now... It feels like someone punched me in the stomach...</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong> No doubt because you haven&#39;t eaten anything. I guess we have no choice but to feed you a monster&#39;s flesh and blood.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Not that... Please don&#39;t...</p><p><strong>White Dragon Horse:</strong> [[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]\u2013!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> He&#39;s saying there is a cave up ahead!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Maybe there&#39;s water.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Hey...Fujimaru, ...just one thing...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Who is... Mash? You were calling that name when you were under the rock.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Fujimaru, is she important to you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...A junior that&#39;s very important to me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I feel like we are together even when we are apart.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> ...I see...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Something smells sweet... The smell of fruits... This place, it must be a food storage!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> That&#39;s my number one disciple! You have a great nose, I mean, intuition! Let&#39;s eat!</p><p><strong>White Dragon Horse:</strong> [[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]\u2013!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Uh, what? A trap? That peach is rotten?</p><p><strong>Golden Horn:</strong> Oh. I thought you&#39;d be the one to eat it first and turn into a carrot. I guess it won&#39;t be that easy.</p><p><strong>Golden Horn:</strong> Hehe, welcome to the Lotus Cave, Tang monk and her apprentices.</p><p><strong>Silver Horn:</strong> I am so tired of waiting. But that monkey there looks ready to eat, all dehydrated like that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> The evil-looking Gorgon Sisters!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Wait a minute, they don&#39;t recognize us!?</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong> The Lotus Cave, you said. That means they are the Golden Horned King and the Silver Horned King\u2014</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong> ...They&#39;re so similar it&#39;s sad to even look.</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong> That&#39;s not good. It&#39;s not just they&#39;re way too into their roles, they&#39;re even turning back to being the goddesses that bring destruction upon humans.</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong> I see... It seems you are aware of the enemy&#39;s True Name\u2014</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong> Fujimaru. I don&#39;t think I need to explain, but Golden Horn and Silver Horn will come with THOSE.</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong> If you answer to your name, that gourd will suck you in and melt you alive.</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong> The Purple Gold Red Gourd and the Suet Jade Flask. I cannot see them.</p><p><strong>Silver Horn:</strong> There&#39;s no need for us to use Noble Phantasms. Once you&#39;re under our poison, you will call out our names and beg us.</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong> I see. So this cave is like a gourd&#39;s reservoir, and we are flies that fell on the surface of the water.</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong> Trying to fight the enemies in your own safe zone... How unscrupulous! Shame on you, you wicked women!</p><p><strong>Golden Horn:</strong> It&#39;s not unscrupulous, it&#39;s negligent. But then, I can sense the same smell from you too, though.</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong> Humph, I don&#39;t think so, lady. Did you think I would get mad being provoked?</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong> If I&#39;m in danger just by being here, then I will leave the fighting to the experts. I&#39;m stepping back, oink.</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong> Come on, [\u2642 Brother /\u2640 Sister] Fujimaru! Please take care of them!</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong> Of course. The main feature of \u201CJourney to the West\u201D is the tales of demon huntings!</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong> Looks like neither Golden Horn nor Silver Horn are trained. Lord Red Horse and myself will suffice\u2014!</p><p><strong>White Dragon Horse:</strong> [[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]\u2013!</p><p><strong>Golden Horn:</strong> Idiot. Sweet ladies like us wouldn&#39;t want to get blood blisters from spears or get the rusted metal smell of swords on us, would we?</p><p><strong>Silver Horn:</strong> There is a lot of food and water here. And the scriptures you are seeking, too.</p><p><strong>Golden Horn:</strong> But we will consume everything.</p><p><strong>Both:</strong> Come! Melt them, unthaw them, dissolve them and drink them all up...</p><p><strong>Both:</strong> \u2014Bronze Horn!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Bronze Horn\u2014!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That&#39;s the first I&#39;ve heard of it!?</p><p><strong>Bronze Horn:</strong> Ummm... Right... I&#39;m Bronze Horn...</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong> Great! Bronze Horn is outside of my strike zone! Don&#39;t hold back and defeat her!</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong> ...No. I am a warrior, not a demon. This bond between these sisters is too tragic, I cannot bear to witness it any longer...</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong> Honestly, I have lost my will to fight. My master, shouldn&#39;t we save Bronze Horn over there?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> No, we can&#39;t. I can tell this is just another one of their tricks.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> It&#39;s a conventional method to make us lower our guard. We can&#39;t buy into it.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Besides, my stomach is at its limit! We&#39;ll talk after we have taken their food!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> GO, Fujimaru! Begin with that big girl first!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s to save my mentor, I have no choice!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Girl...?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Well, I&#39;m stuffed!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Golden Horn and Silver Horn escaped, but they didn&#39;t really do anything bad, so let&#39;s turn a blind eye for now!</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong> Wise decision. The spoils of war are more important right now. Oh, leave the management of the treasure to me. I&#39;ll make sure it&#39;s done right.</p><p><strong>Bronze Horn:</strong> ...Victory is yours. Go ahead and do whatever you want with me. I don&#39;t care.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> How admirable. You&#39;re willing to give up your old ways even though you&#39;re a demon! ...But then again, you haven&#39;t done anything wrong, have you?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Let&#39;s see, which should I have you do... 10,000 Hindu squats or copying the Heart Sutra 10,000 times...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> You look fit already, so maybe copying the Heart Sutra will be a good punishment.</p><p><strong>Bronze Horn:</strong> Well then, I will copy the sutra. Yes, copying sounds good. I&#39;m not good at that.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Okay! Then I&#39;ll write you a recommendation letter to the librarian at Daci&#39;en Temple! Study hard!</p><p><strong>Bronze Horn:</strong> Thank you so much. Personally this is the best thing ever!</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong> Bronze Horn... No, I shouldn&#39;t say anything now. It&#39;s better than being turned into some kind of demon king.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> My mentor. Here is the scripture.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Sanzang. The scripture.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Um... Yes. I see, so you&#39;ve done your job.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> I was a little worried, but it seems this time around my disciples are hard workers!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Wukong, Wujing, Bajie!

But it&#39;s no problem! (HAH)</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Red Boy... You have reformed and surrendered yourself to the Bodhisattva... Why do you stand in our way?</p><p><strong>Red Boy:</strong> Because my father will praise me! ...If I return home with your heads, that is!</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong> Your father must be the Ox-Demon King. According to the story of Journey to the West, that is.</p><p><strong>Red Boy:</strong> Hey, call him by his proper name! He&#39;s the Great Sage Who Pacifies Heaven, the King of Great Strength, the Nine-Headed Ox-Demon King!</p><p><strong>Red Boy:</strong> Oh, damn, I said it again! But that&#39;s fine! My father is cool, anyway!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I feel for your father...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That whole family is messed up...</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong> Red Boy is supposed to kidnap Sanzang through disguises and other tricks.

So you agreed to travel with me half-heartedly?</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong> Hmmm... For Shuwen, he&#39;s content as long as he gets to fight powerful enemies.</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong> Maybe I&#39;m the same? But what about [\u2642 Brother /\u2640 Sister] Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> ...What...do you think? Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> There must be light at the end of this tunnel!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> \u2014Of course! I won&#39;t give up after only one or two lifetimes!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Because this is my story! Thank you, Fujimaru!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> The key must lie within the scriptures we gather.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> The skinny guy from Chaldea said the same thing. In that case, then I&#39;m truly dancing on top of the Buddha&#39;s palm...</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong> \u2014Brothers, wait.</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong> The Flaming Mountains... They are a test.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Uh!?</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong> Oh, a new face? At any rate, not one we have seen in Chaldea.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Is that the one who&#39;s been following us?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Twintails and a Chinese dress?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> ...Ugh... You are... Ugh... I feel like I can almost remember you...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Why? It&#39;s so frustrating! This intense feeling of d\xE9j\xE0 vu is suffocating...</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong> Impossible. Can not remember.</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong> That memory. Inside. This scripture.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> !?</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong> \u2014Lamentable. Xuanzang Sanzang. Once pure and holy. Currently despicable. Mediocre woman.</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong> No will to sacrifice thyself. Bereft tolerance and benevolence. Know there is... no shortcut to Tianzhu.</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong> Simply put. You. No longer fit as Qitian Dasheng&#39;s master.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Uh! (Shocked)</p><p><strong>H\uFF1A???:</strong> Chat. Completed.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Twintails gave her a lecture...</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong> You&#39;re wrong, [\u2642 Brother /\u2640 Sister]. If the hair doesn&#39;t reach the shoulders, it&#39;s more appropriate to call it \u201Cpigtails,\u201D oink.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Flying away on wheels... I&#39;m jealous.</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong> That person might appear collected, but in truth, she was agitated to the point that she abandoned her role as an observer and interfered...</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong> Yeah. She seemed like she knew our master well... Well?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> To be honest... I can&#39;t quite remember...</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong> I see. Your memory has been locked away. However... I have an idea as to who she really is.</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong> That flaming spear must be the Fire-tipped Spear... And those bangles she wore must be the Universe Ring...</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong> In addition, her young appearance... Although she does speak in a strange tone...</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong> It appears that she might be Prince Nezha, the Marshal of the Central Altar\u2014 One with a name as well-known as Qitian Dasheng, Sun Wukong.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Ne...zha...</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong> Don&#39;t underestimate that young warrior. She&#39;s a doll made entirely of Paopei.</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong> In Chaldea&#39;s terminology, she would probably be called a Noble Phantasm Human. I feel I must cross swords with that warrior.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Sensei&#39;s bad habit is back...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Didn&#39;t it seem like she was worrying about Lu Bu?</p><p><strong>White Dragon Horse:</strong> [[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]\u2013?</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong> She left with the scripture that contains the master&#39;s memory.</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong> So we came up dry this time. It seems like we can&#39;t cheat.</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong> There&#39;s always someone watching... I guess that&#39;s the same in every country.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> ...Banana Leaf...Fan...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> I remember now! Yes, the Banana Leaf Fan!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Listen, we took the wrong steps. We need a Noble Phantasm... An item to cross the Flaming Mountains!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> We need the Banana Leaf Fan!

I wonder what kind of beautiful madam she is?</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong> Yeah, an older married woman doesn&#39;t sound bad. Anyway, a beautiful lady is beautiful even if she is someone else&#39;s wife.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Hey you! Don&#39;t get excited about the \u201Csomeone else&#39;s wife\u201D part. Keep it to yourself!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Anyway, it&#39;s impossible to predict what kind of people we&#39;ll meet on this journey...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Based on what Mo Boy said, I can take a guess...</p><p><strong>Red Boy:</strong> No joke!

Sorry, I was eating some potato chips!</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> Correction. You will address me as \u201CMother,\u201D or else I will cut that infected tongue out.</p><p><strong>Red Boy:</strong> Sorry, Mom! Please don&#39;t cut my tongue off!</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> I will tolerate staying out overnight without permission... but did you wash your hands when you got home?</p><p><strong>Red Boy:</strong> I did! Very thoroughly for about five seconds! Then dried them with the Banana Leaf Fan!</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> That explains the mess in the bathroom. What happens if those germs get spread around the castle?</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> I&#39;ve told you to carry disposable towels with you so many times... Hmmm? Did you rinse your mouth after returning home?</p><p><strong>Red Boy:</strong> Of course! For about three seconds while drinking cola!</p><p><strong>Red Boy:</strong> Hear my beautiful voice. We have a similar voice, right? Genetically mother and child!</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> ...Red Boy. What&#39;s that scratch on your cheek?</p><p><strong>Red Boy:</strong> (Gasp)</p><p><strong>Red Boy:</strong> Just a scratch! It&#39;s nothing! Just put some saliva on it and\u2014</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> \u2014It seems I need to teach you a lesson. To the medical room. I will treat you myself.</p><p><strong>Red Boy:</strong> Ahhhhhh, I&#39;m sorry, Mom!</p><p><strong>Red Boy:</strong> I don&#39;t wanna wash my face in a bucket of peroxide again!</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong> ...It&#39;s kind of like an army torture scene.</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong> Too much enthusiasm for education... Kids grow up open-minded when left free, but...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Either way, she&#39;s nobody&#39;s fool... We did beat Red Boy, but didn&#39;t kill him.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> There&#39;s no reason Princess Iron Fan would get mad.

My partner is not here in this castle. He must be wandering about...</p><p><strong>Princess Iron Fan:</strong> Even Red Boy is following his bad example... My patience is just about running out.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s not a good idea to take your frustration out on your son.</p><p><strong>Princess Iron Fan:</strong> My principle of education is perfect! I even allow my son independence!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Just allowing?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Are you tolerant?</p><p><strong>Princess Iron Fan:</strong> Um... Well...</p><p><strong>Princess Iron Fan:</strong> ...Fujimaru, was it? Did you come here to provoke me?</p><p><strong>Princess Iron Fan:</strong> I&#39;m always furious... at this unsanitary world... at the fact that accursed disease runs rampant everywhere.</p><p><strong>Princess Iron Fan:</strong> Yes! Travelers like you are especially beyond help!</p><p><strong>Princess Iron Fan:</strong> Greedy for repletion, knowledge, and pleasure; living as you desire. You would dig up buried relics and wake dormant indigenous diseases.</p><p><strong>Princess Iron Fan:</strong> Surely you&#39;re going about spreading a pandemic of pallidness. You&#39;re nothing but a walking compost!</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong> That&#39;s not true! I simply bought some buns, and threw the leftovers on the street!</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong> It&#39;s charity for the animals. I litter. With no hesitation.</p><p><strong>Princess Iron Fan:</strong> \u2014I am so careless. There is one facility this mountain is missing.</p><p><strong>Princess Iron Fan:</strong> The chef with the red cape said, \u201Cthe pig is a very useful domestic animal. The only part you can&#39;t use is its scream.\u201D</p><p><strong>Princess Iron Fan:</strong> Let&#39;s test those words. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m a nurse.</p><p><strong>Princess Iron Fan:</strong> I&#39;m used to people writhing and screaming in pain. Scream like you could tear up the sky!</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong> Phew, good response to provocation, deathly nurse! I&#39;ll leave the rest to you, [\u2642 Brother /\u2640 Sister]!</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong> I don&#39;t get along with ladies who don&#39;t understand humor!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Fine, I&#39;ll accept the challenge! You guys, I&#39;m counting on you!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> So...this is the Banana Leaf Fan? Looks pretty different than the legends...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Doesn&#39;t it look...like a certain holy sword? Is it even okay for a monk to hold a sword?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> It is said that in order to cut the root of the fire from the Flaming Mountains, one needs to fan the flame forty-nine times. But she said that since this is EX-ranked, you just need to fan it once.</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong> Princess Iron Fan handed out the scripture she possessed obediently. I cannot fathom the reason that only the Banana Leaf Fan would be a fake.</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong> Anyhow, once we use it, we&#39;ll know if it&#39;s fake or not, oink.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> That&#39;s true. I&#39;ll try! Here we go\u2014</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Ex...calibanana Leaf Fan!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Amazing! It&#39;s gone! It blew all the fire away!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> So all that fire-walking training for nothing? Well, never mind!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Fujimaru! We did it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Um, so only the Ox-Demon King is left?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Let&#39;s hope the Ox-Demon King is understanding.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> \u2014Yes!</p><h2 id="volume-6-sky-scraping-cave-great-sage-who-pacifies-heaven-ox-demon-king" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#volume-6-sky-scraping-cave-great-sage-who-pacifies-heaven-ox-demon-king" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Volume 6: &quot;Sky Scraping Cave: Great Sage Who Pacifies Heaven, Ox-Demon King&quot;</h2><p><strong>Ox-Demon King:</strong> I am the eldest of a fraternity of demon brothers whose names are renowned even up in heaven\u2014 I am the Nine-Headed Ox-Demon King!</p><p><strong>Ox-Demon King:</strong> Hereafter, you may refer to me as Ox-Demon King.

Then let me move on to important matters.</p><p><strong>Ox-Demon King:</strong> O eminent Tang Monk, Xuanzang Sanzang\u2014 This is the scripture that has been entrusted to me.</p><p><strong>Ox-Demon King:</strong> And this is the other scripture Nezha gave me when she visited this castle earlier.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Nezha did that?</p><p><strong>Ox-Demon King:</strong> You may have both of these scriptures. It is the Buddha&#39;s will.</p><p><strong>Ox-Demon King:</strong> Meaning, your journey ends here.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> ...Wh-What did you say?</p><p><strong>Ox-Demon King:</strong> I said it&#39;s the Buddha&#39;s will. You now have all six scriptures.</p><p><strong>Ox-Demon King:</strong> \u2014The Buddha gave me a mission.</p><p><strong>Ox-Demon King:</strong> The Buddha said he sealed your memory of the realization of the transient nature of the five desires into the scriptures scattered along the trip.</p><p><strong>Ox-Demon King:</strong> The five desires are sights, sounds, scents, tastes, and tactility.</p><p><strong>Ox-Demon King:</strong> In other words, the attachment that arises from contact with the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and body.</p><p><strong>Ox-Demon King:</strong> This kind of explanation probably sounds unnecessary to you, though, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> One, two, three, four, five... What&#39;s the last one?</p><p><strong>Ox-Demon King:</strong> The last of the six scriptures is \u201Cmeaning.\u201D The attachment produced by the heart.</p><p><strong>Ox-Demon King:</strong> Ending your journey here and being satisfied from the bottom of your heart will recover the enlightenment you lost\u2014!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> What... What? Wait. Wait!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> My journey doesn&#39;t end here! It still continues!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> I&#39;m going to Tianzhu! That&#39;s why I&#39;ve traveled this far!</p><p><strong>Ox-Demon King:</strong> You already have all the scriptures!</p><p><strong>Ox-Demon King:</strong> Do you not understand!? It is the Buddha&#39;s mercy, Xuanzang Sanzang.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> But what&#39;ll happen with them? What&#39;s going to happen to my dear disciples?</p><p><strong>Ox-Demon King:</strong> Your apprentices will continue on to Tianzhu. That will bring them back to the world they belong to.</p><p><strong>Ox-Demon King:</strong> You, too, must have a place to go back to.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> ...A place to go back to... My house in Chang&#39;an...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> ...No! I want to continue my journey!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> I haven&#39;t accomplished anything! I appreciate the scriptures, but that&#39;s not it!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> I&#39;m not ready to recite them correctly. I&#39;m not there yet!</p><p><strong>Ox-Demon King:</strong> How unreasonable you are...</p><p><strong>Ox-Demon King:</strong> The scriptures of the Buddha possess an inherent value to the common folk. They do not care who is reciting them</p><p><strong>Ox-Demon King:</strong> If you cannot realize that, you sure are far from enlightenment.</p><p><strong>Ox-Demon King:</strong> No need to worry, though.</p><p><strong>Ox-Demon King:</strong> Let me blow your attachment away and send you back to the furthest ends of the Far East with my fan, the Excalibanana Leaf Fan.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> ...I see... This is my own battle.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Fujimaru... You guys shouldn&#39;t come...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Otherwise it will make the Buddha angry and you won&#39;t be able to return.</p><p><strong>Sha Wujing:</strong> ...O Xuanzang Sanzang.

We&#39;re Servants after all. We don&#39;t have anywhere to go back to.</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong> Returning to the Throne of Heroes means we will disappear. Chaldea is an exception, but we can&#39;t return there quite yet.</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong> There is a place I want to go back to. But I&#39;ll just fight, have fun, and die, though.</p><p><strong>Zhu Bajie:</strong> And this big dude here, it&#39;s like preaching to whatchamacallit.</p><p><strong>White Dragon Horse:</strong> [[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]\u2013!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Fujimaru ...No, my unworthy number one disciple?

Everything!</p><p><strong>Ox-Demon King:</strong> They&#39;re all full of that pungent odor of disinfectant. So I asked if he could please do something about it!</p><p><strong>Ox-Demon King:</strong> She cooks homey and delicious British cuisine... But that odor ruins everything... I can&#39;t bear it anymore... (Shudder)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So that&#39;s why her food sucks?</p><p><strong>Ox-Demon King:</strong> ...Whew. I apologize for the unsightly manner.</p><p><strong>Ox-Demon King:</strong> A fair warning, Xuanzang Sanzang. I do not guarantee anything on your way from here on.</p><p><strong>Ox-Demon King:</strong> You will most likely not have the Buddha&#39;s protection either.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Don&#39;t worry, Ox-Demon King. Do you think my faith will waver because of that?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Besides, that&#39;s what makes a journey a journey!</p><p><strong>Ox-Demon King:</strong> All right...

I will take you as my disciple again.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> In that case, I want to be your number one disciple again!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Whaaaat? Isn&#39;t that a bit presumptuous? Hahaha.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> You have many people dear to you waiting for you at Chaldea, right?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> But for being a fantastic neophyte who plays a key role in the survival of humanity, I might give you that side benefit.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> If that&#39;s the case, I want you to call me Master!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> That&#39;s...um, well, that depends on the merits you will have accrued by that day.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> ...That&#39;s why I won&#39;t say goodbye.
