It&#39;s all thanks to you, I should say.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Let me say thank you from my heart. I might finally be liberated from my own karma.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...Well, I don&#39;t know. You don&#39;t look like you are about to be liberated.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fooou...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yeah...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That bloodstain worries me...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Uh, yes... Let&#39;s see... Senpai... When he says he might be liberated...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It might mean a liberation reaffirming violence... don&#39;t you feel... it can, be taken, that way...?</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Actually, Sorry I had you bring me all the way to London, the Fourth Singularity.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> I&#39;m grateful to you guys. Ascension, was it? It was truly amazing.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> I&#39;m impressed that it could turn me, nothing more than a failed mage, into such a powerful Servant.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Besides, as you can see... I got a chance to come to London, though the Demonic Fog still remains.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Since the Holy Grail was removed, London is undergoing correction to its original era\u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But what brought you here? You just wanted to visit your homeland, is that it?</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Huh? Sure, something like that.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Mash, you are quite perceptive. Yes, I wanted to see my &quot;homeland&quot; firsthand.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> I&#39;m glad you understand me. You&#39;re &quot;lovely,&quot; Mash Kyrielight.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> A-A love confession!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No, I don&#39;t think so. He seems\u2014</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Oh, I love you, London! Of course I love you, sky! Gas lamp! I love you very much!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> As you see, his love spreads very wide. But it is exactly as we predicted beforehand...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Well, I&#39;m sorry for interrupting when you are hyped up, but there&#39;s a bit of Demonic Fog left\u2014</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> You guys might hinder the phenomenon called Correction of the Era by being there. Yeah, who knows what might happen?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Isn&#39;t it time for us to go back? Can I prepare for Rayshift?</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> ...I&#39;m sorry, but will you wait just a little? There is a place I want to visit.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> You guys saw &quot;me&quot; once before, right? In this era, in this foggy city, seeking the Fourth Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You mean, we saw you in your lifetime. Yes, you did help us a lot.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Do you remember? About when you saved London with us\u2014</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Sure, mostly. Anyway, you know...</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> ...I want to see for myself. This apartment where I supposedly lived.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> If possible, I wish to talk to myself in my lifetime, too.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Hmm, I get it. But, you should know that Mr. Jekyll may no longer be there.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> This era is being corrected. He may already have returned to the time he&#39;s supposed to live in.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Even if so... I still wish to visit. May I?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> If you could see him... Would there be anything you should do?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Is that why you came to this era?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Face yourself, huh.</p><hr><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Yes, I have something to tell him. That no matter what happens in the future, he can definitely overcome it.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> At least I overcame &quot;Hyde&quot; by killing myself. So, I hope that I can just...</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> ...give my past self a piece of advice. It can even be something short like &quot;Be brave and face yourself.&quot;</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> I know it&#39;s merely self-satisfaction. Whatever I say will probably be erased in the Correction of the Era.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> And yet... I wish to tell him...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Well, if that&#39;s the case\u2014 Hmm, Is it okay? Is something like this okay?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Of course, it won&#39;t cause something like a time paradox, but Hmm. Hmm.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Foou!!</p><p><strong>Past Jekyll:</strong> ...So you came to me?</p><p><strong>Past Jekyll:</strong> I understand most of the situation. At any rate, it&#39;s great to see you guys again like this.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Pleasure is ours.</p><p><strong>Past Jekyll:</strong> Saber and the Heroic Spirits... are all gone. No, I am fully aware of that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Oh, you rather seem different?</p><p><strong>Past Jekyll:</strong> You\u2014think?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Me, too, it&#39;s good to see you again, Mr. Henry Jekyll.</p><p><strong>Past Jekyll:</strong> I&#39;m glad to know you&#39;re doing great. And, well, whom I see over there is my\u2014</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> &quot;Your future self.&quot; Just think that way for now.</p><p><strong>Past Jekyll:</strong> &quot;I thought so.&quot; I take it you understood the basic gist at a glance.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> In that case, I suppose you also know what I&#39;m trying to do, Mr. Henry Jekyll?</p><p><strong>Past Jekyll:</strong> Surely.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Haha\u2014Then, can you die for me?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> !?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Foou!!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> W-What!? What&#39;s going on there!? He just jumped on Mr. Jekyll, didn&#39;t he!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> He did, Doctor. He...tried to murder himself from his lifetime!</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Haha... That&#39;s right, I wish...</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong> \u2014No, you listen to me!</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong> I wanna kill me, or &quot;Jekyll&quot;... Who&#39;s lived his goody-goody life from the day he was born!</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong> Honesty, trust, goodwill! I don&#39;t need that kind of crap!</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong> You hear me? I can&#39;t stand the fact that you exist!</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong> I will kill you! And I will be the complete &quot;Hyde!&quot;</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;m positive he&#39;s an anti-hero! Wait, he is, right? A-at any rate, we must stop him!</p><p><strong>Past Jekyll:</strong> Well, it&#39;s okay. I&#39;ve always wanted to fight seriously with him once.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Mr. Jekyll?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;re reckless to battle a Heroic Spirit!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You want to kill yourself?</p><hr><p><strong>Past Jekyll:</strong> I&#39;m not losing my mind. And, I&#39;m not a powerless human failure of a mage, either.</p><p><strong>Past Jekyll:</strong> I am a &quot;Heroic Spirit.&quot; I&#39;m one of the lost Servants materialized from the remains of Demonic Fog.</p><p><strong>Past Jekyll:</strong> I was summoned after you returned to Chaldea, and the living Jekyll returned to his original era\u2014that&#39;s the story.</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong> What!?</p><p><strong>Past Jekyll:</strong> Somehow I had a feeling that a thing like this could happen\u2014</p><p><strong>Past Jekyll:</strong> So I was waiting. Right in this room, right after my living self returned to the original era.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Two identical Heroic Spirits are in the same place!? Could this really...happen?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Wait a second. I see. Maybe his spirit &quot;has completely separated personalities?&quot;</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong> Damn, damn, damn! Shoot, I did all this for nothing!!</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong> Finally! I thought I could finally kill &quot;Jekyll&quot;!</p><p><strong>Past Jekyll:</strong> You should read Wells. Though his books were published after we died.</p><p><strong>Past Jekyll:</strong> The rank system of Heroic Spirits may be something that transcends such a notion, but it&#39;s fine\u2014</p><p><strong>Past Jekyll:</strong> Fujimaru, Mash. Can you fight with him against me?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What do you mean\u2014</p><p><strong>Past Jekyll:</strong> If he&#39;s like that, he could be dangerous to get along as your ally, right?</p><p><strong>Past Jekyll:</strong> So, I think I should make him learn his lesson now. For the future.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It makes sense!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Doctor!</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong> Fine. Fine, you bastard! I&#39;ll be happy to play your game, even by myself!</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong> Goddamnit\u2014 I&#39;m going to take all my pent-up anger out on you!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> S-Senpai! What are we going to do now...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Whatever happens happens!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> We just do the best we can!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Y-yes, Master! Servant battle\u2014commencing!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Past Jekyll:</strong> ...Whew. Your combat power is as quite good as I expected. Well done.</p><p><strong>Past Jekyll:</strong> Well, I&#39;ll be going now. I&#39;m sure he learned what his limit was after all.</p><p><strong>Past Jekyll:</strong> Nothing will do you good to be overcome by &quot;Hyde.&quot; Don&#39;t forget your original purpose, &quot;myself.&quot;</p><p><strong>Past Jekyll:</strong> Are you going to live a life that would shame Tatsumi? Think a little, and you&#39;d have figured that out.</p><p><strong>Past Jekyll:</strong> Mash, Fujimaru. Give my regards to Saber and Fran if you see them.</p><p><strong>Past Jekyll:</strong> Good-bye\u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Servant Jekyll is gone.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> We got the results of the observation. It shows that his existence itself was unstable.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The Demonic Fog remaining in London is not perfect, either, so it wasn&#39;t a proper summon or materialization.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> He would have disappeared by himself sometime soon anyway. So, um\u2014</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong> ...Humph.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> That killed the mood. I should probably leave it at that, too.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> That part of &quot;me&quot; looked happy when he disappeared. What the hell was that &quot;learning his limit.&quot;</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> ...Oh my.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (Oh\u2014)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (Senpai. Compared to before, he seems...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> A bit more obedient.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Calmed down?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (...Yes)</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> I&#39;ll return to Chaldea. Pardon me for getting you in trouble, Master.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> It&#39;s true I acknowledge that I am also &quot;Hyde.&quot; but it wouldn&#39;t do any good if my thoughts become too hasty.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> ...It will, ah, never allow me to achieve anything.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Someday I will resume my battle to control &quot;Hyde&quot; myself. I&#39;m truly sorry, Master, Mash.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> I should take no more detour and start correcting the world now.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> ...I&#39;ll challenge myself to a rematch afterwards.</p>',144),a=[n];function l(g,i){return o(),e("div",null,a)}var h=t(s,[["render",l],["__file","Henry Jekyll & Hyde.html.vue"]]);export{h as default};
