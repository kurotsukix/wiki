How do I know I&#39;m not actually someone else&#39;s puppet?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Maybe this world is fake, and I&#39;m just a brain in a jar imagining the whole thing...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Maybe I don&#39;t actually exist.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> My Legends... My Myths... Those exist. I wonder why...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...Who am I?</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> (Gasp, gasp, gasp)...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The sky is muddied and dirty. Even the water tastes foul.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The scent of blood is everywhere. Everything about this place is terrible.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The bleeding won&#39;t stop. There&#39;s nowhere left I can run.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> How does it feel to die?</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> ...It sucks.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I keep smiling, grinning, sneering, like I don&#39;t give a damn.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> But even though this is the end for me, the same familiar doubt nags at the back of my mind.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> And when you get right down to it, I spend my entire life asking myself the same question.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Who was I, really?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I wonder if this guy has the answer.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Hey, do you know who I was?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> You were\u2013</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> But before he could finish, I closed my eyes and drifted off.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Never thought I&#39;d end up back in Shinjuku...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Our connection is holding strong, Master. Let&#39;s go over the situation one more time.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The Shinjuku Singularity has already been repaired.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So no matter what might be going on here, it won&#39;t have any effect on humanity...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Still, we don&#39;t know why a single Servant decided to Rayshift here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The Assassin of Shinjuku. True Name: Yan Qing...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I wonder what&#39;s going on with him.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m afraid all we know right now is that he Rayshifted here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You&#39;re sure he came to Shinjuku?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We were tracking his Spirit Origin up till he disappeared here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> However, there were some, um, irregularities with the tracking data, so I don&#39;t know if we can trust it entirely.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Hassan of the Cursed Arm and Geronimo have come along to serve as your guides.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Thank you both for doing this.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> I am pleased to be here.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> Well Master, where shall we begin our search?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> We&#39;ll never find him without a plan. I think our only option is to follow his magical energy.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I agree. And we do have tracking data that should help us with that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The problem is that Yan Qing&#39;s trail went cold here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Maybe he interfered with our observational equipment somehow, or maybe...</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> Yes. He may have been injured or killed.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> Oh, sorry, my apologies. Worry not, [\u2642 Lord /\u2640\uFE0F Lady} Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> Lord Yan Qing is as tough as they come.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> What&#39;s more, I imagine he feels especially at home in an urban setting like this. He will not die easily.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> Indeed. I don&#39;t even need to read his fortune to assure you that he is alive and well.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> All right, I&#39;ll begin by searching the perimeter.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> Once I have the lay of the land, we can begin a thorough investigation.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> Very well then, we&#39;ll wait here until you return.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> I would like to resolve this quickly, given Master&#39;s physical limitations.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> Haha, a good point. Then I will be back as soon as I can.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> See you later!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Be careful out there!</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> You are too kind, Master. But worry not. We Hassans blend into shadows as naturally as breathing.</p><hr><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> All right, let&#39;s wait and see how\u2013</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> I found him.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> Wha...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Already!?</p><hr><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Yo, lady!</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Can I get one of those mystery meat buns?</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Thanks.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yep, that&#39;s him...</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> I could hardly believe my eyes. I&#39;ve never seen such a lazy Assassin.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What&#39;s he doing here?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> ...We will just have to ask him once we&#39;ve caught him.</p><hr><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Oh, hey Master. What&#39;s up?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s what I wanna know!</p><hr><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> ?</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> ...Oh, yeah, right. Guess I kinda left without saying anything, huh.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Sorry about that. And I&#39;m sorry about this, too...</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> ...but there&#39;s something I gotta do here, and I&#39;m not leaving till it&#39;s done.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AYan Qing (?):</strong> So I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t let you bring me back!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;re using your doppelg\xE4nger power!?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AYan Qing (?):</strong> You know it.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AYan Qing (?):</strong> I can&#39;t let myself be caught, no matter what! So you better believe I&#39;m pulling out all the stops!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> He transformed!</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> Hmm, this could be a problem. Now, what to do about it...</p><hr><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> It would seem he&#39;s quite desperate. In that case...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> ...the only way he&#39;ll listen to reason is if we knock some into him. Let&#39;s do this, Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Okay everyone, prepare for combat!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Yan Qing (?):</strong> Sorry, the answer&#39;s still no. Later!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> A smoke bomb...!</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> He must have taken it from someone while we were fighting.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> N-now what do we do?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> He did say there was something he had to do here...</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> ...We can&#39;t let him do it, whatever it may be. Let&#39;s go after him, [\u2642 Lord /\u2640\uFE0F Lady} Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> Oh? Does that mean you know what Yan Qing is up to, Cursed Arm?</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> I do, for it concerns me personally.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> Now, let us be on our way. We may not know what that way is yet, but no matter.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> We will just have to keep looking until we find it. For a Hassan, it is, as they say, business as usual.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I don&#39;t mind roaming around looking for what I have to do. That irredeemable thing I can&#39;t just wipe off my slate.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> If someone tries to stop me, I&#39;ll eliminate them. After all, I know I&#39;m doing the right thing.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> To get my chance at being a good person...I&#39;ll take my revenge on him.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> Going after Yan Qing is all well and good...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> ...but how are we going to find him when he could be anyone here?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> Any ideas?</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> Yes, actually. I snuck a cursed scent mark onto him during our battle.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> It has been passed down our clan for generations, and should let me know when I&#39;m drawing near him.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> Oho, you don&#39;t say. Quite clever.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> In that case, Cursed Arm, I think it&#39;s best if you lead the way.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> Is that all right with you, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Absolutely!</p><hr><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> ...Hmm. It&#39;s faint, but I can smell the scent nearby.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> We may have tracked him down sooner than I thought. Come, this way.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> In the meantime, let&#39;s think about what Yan Qing may have meant earlier.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What do you mean?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> I mean the thing he said he needs to do.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> The thing he said he needs to do?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> That&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> What does he hope to accomplish by coming back to Shinjuku?</p><hr><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> What do you know about this, Cursed Arm?</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> ...Hmm.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> I&#39;d rather not discuss it, but under the circumstances, I suppose I can share.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> You see, Lord Yan Qing actually came to apologize to me once, back when we were still at Chaldea.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You mean, about what happened in Shinjuku?</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> Indeed. You have an excellent memory, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What about?</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> The incident in Shinjuku, most likely.</p><hr><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> &#39;Sup, Cursed Arm. Got a minute?</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> Why, if it isn&#39;t Lord Yan Qing. What brings you to my humble room?</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Uh, I just wanted to say I was sorry.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> Sorry...? If you&#39;ve done something to wrong me, I can&#39;t say I&#39;m aware of it.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> It sounds like I did you a real disservice back in Shinjuku, so, you know.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> ...Now I see. Yes, I do recall reading about that in the Shinjuku report.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> I looked it over after I heard my name was mentioned, and there is nothing for you to apologize for.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> Spies like us are quite used to disguises and betrayal. It all comes with the territory.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Yeah, maybe. And honestly, I don&#39;t even remember doing it.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> But there&#39;s this little voice in my Spirit Origin that keeps nagging at me.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Says I&#39;ll never be able to move on if I don&#39;t apologize to you first.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> And that, if possible...I need to go back to Shinjuku and finish what I started.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> Finish what you started...?</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Yup. You know what they say...</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> If you commit the crime, you gotta do the time.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> ...But, have you not already done your \u201Ctime\u201D by fighting alongside Master?</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> I see no reason why you need to seek further redemption in Shinjuku.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> ...Yeah, true. Fair point.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Now that I think about, I feel pretty damn silly! Just forget I said anything, all right?</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> He never brought it up again after that, so I never chose to pursue it further...</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> But now that we&#39;re here, I&#39;m reminded of how empty his smile seemed back then.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> I think Lord Yan Qing is still trying to make amends.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> Amends, huh.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> However, whatever the Assassin of Shinjuku may have done here, it has nothing to do with Yan Qing.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> No, I&#39;ll go further: it would be wrong if it did. That would mean the sins we commit would pile higher and higher every time we were summoned.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> The heroes from the Age of Gods may be able to endure such a burden, but that is far too much for an ordinary person.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> That is why our actions are recorded independent of our memories.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> As a Demi-Servant myself, I don&#39;t have any of his memories...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...but if I did, I agree that the mental burden of such a thing would be overwhelming.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> But, Yan Qing&#39;s...</p><hr><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> ...No more talk. We&#39;ve found him.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> That Hornet over there is Lord Yan Qing.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yan Qing!</p><hr><p><strong>Yan Qing (?):</strong> Aw crap, you already found me!?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> Yan Qing. Are you here to seek redemption?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> Or perhaps, retribution for your sins?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AYan Qing:</strong> ...It&#39;s not a matter of seeking it out, Geronimo. I HAVE to be punished for what I did.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AYan Qing:</strong> Otherwise, I won&#39;t be me anymore.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...My head is pounding.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> These upstanding Heroic Spirit types don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to live with this kind of pain in your soul.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Just getting killed off isn&#39;t nearly enough. I need to die in misery and agony.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yan Qing...?</p><hr><p><strong>E\uFF1AYan Qing:</strong> ...Please just let me do this, Master. Please... I&#39;m begging you.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AYan Qing:</strong> I have to die for what I did.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> I&#39;m afraid that is a crude and contradictory way of seeing things, Yan Qing.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> You fight to take on sins that can only be paid for with your own life... That is a manner of thinking with which I am all too familiar.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> But you are woefully wet behind the ears if your only concern is wiping your regrets away, as mine once was.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AYan Qing:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> What would you have us do, Master?</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> If you are willing to accept his sins, we can return to Chaldea right now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a good idea.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> ...Hehe, I see.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Let&#39;s just talk about this, okay?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AYan Qing:</strong> Sorry, but I really don&#39;t have time to talk!</p><hr><p><strong>E\uFF1AYan Qing:</strong> ...Dammit, I shoulda known it&#39;d come to this.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AYan Qing (?):</strong> Sorry, Master, but if this is how it&#39;s gonna be, I&#39;m not gonna make it easy for you!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> Hmm, I see has no small skill in multiplying himself.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um, I think he just called in reinforcements...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ahem. At any rate, entering combat mode...now!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> He must have run off while we were fighting the other Hornets.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> Still... Hmm. Are you sure about this, Cursed Arm?</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> About what?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> Are we truly doing the right thing here?</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> ...Of course. That is why I came here, after all.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What are you talking about?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Wait. You don&#39;t mean...</p><hr><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> I will explain the next time we encounter Yan Qing.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> He needs to hear this just as much as you do.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...Where is he?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> He&#39;s not here.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> He&#39;s not anywhere.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> That can&#39;t be right. He&#39;s GOTTA be here.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> He&#39;s just gotta be.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Oh man, my body&#39;s falling apart. I can&#39;t maintain my Yan Qing Spirit Origin.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The sky is muddied and dirty. Even the water tastes foul.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> How does it feel to die?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I turn around, and see Death standing there waiting for me.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> There you are. I knew I&#39;d find you here, Hassan of the Cursed Arm.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> That&#39;s right. You&#39;re the one I&#39;ve gotta apologize to. You&#39;re the one I killed.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> No... That&#39;s not right. You killed me.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> ...No, wait. Please, wait. My head...my memories are all a mess... I can&#39;t tell what&#39;s true or not!</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm (?):</strong> Enough of this. It&#39;s time you accepted your fate.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm (?):</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm (?):</strong> We can&#39;t ever atone for our sins.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> ...That voice... No, wait...</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Are you me?</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm (?):</strong> Let me answer your question with one of my own.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm (?):</strong> Who do you think you are?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Hassan wasn&#39;t Hassan...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Yan Qing...!?</p><hr><p><strong>C\uFF1AYan Qing:</strong> Hey there, Master! Sorry &#39;bout this!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AYan Qing:</strong> I definitely meant to trick you, but not like this!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> Hmm. It would seem you are the real Yan Qing.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> And yet, your Spirit Origin is indistinguishable from this Yan Qing.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> ...That can only mean one thing.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> The other Yan Qing is a doppelg\xE4nger.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AYan Qing (?):</strong> Ah... A-ah...</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AYan Qing (?):</strong> Aaahhh!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AYan Qing:</strong> Whoa, whoa, calm down, other me! Ah crap. I knew it was too soon to pull back the curtains!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Is that...a Servant? No, now they&#39;re...Christine? And Hassan, and Yan Qing...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> They keep transforming into all sorts of different enemies!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AYan Qing:</strong> It doesn&#39;t matter who he turns into. We just gotta get him to calm down, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You mean beat him down.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AYan Qing:</strong> You got it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> So, basically...</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AYan Qing:</strong> We hit him real hard!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> Well, that&#39;s certainly straightforward.</p><hr><p><strong>C\uFF1AYan Qing:</strong> All right, lost other me, it&#39;s time for us to go back where we belong.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AYan Qing:</strong> There&#39;s no one left here you need to make amends to.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AYan Qing:</strong> So if we don&#39;t put an end to everything here... we&#39;re both gonna be left behind for good!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> Khh...</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> We&#39;ve got you now, Hassan-i Sabbah.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> ...So it would seem. Very well, go ahead and take my head.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> Your head? Oh no, I don&#39;t want you dead just yet.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> I need to copy your Spirit Origin first. Otherwise it&#39;d be such a waste of material.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> Yep, that&#39;s right. I&#39;m gonna use your form to pull the wool over those Chaldea chumps&#39; eyes whenever they manage to get here.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> ...So, you are plotting ahead to ensure you can fully deceive your quarry. You truly are an Assassin born.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> Very well then. If that is how it is to be, I will not go down without a fight. I can do no less after being summoned here.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> Oh? You want a piece of me?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> What an honor, facing off with one of the biggest names in the assassin world.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> I thought I was about to die, powerless to do anything...</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> ...but it is exactly when one can do nothing that new options open up.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> What...?</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> ...Zabaniya!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> Hah, nice try! But there&#39;s no way you can copy my heart and crush it before I can stop you!</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> Indeed, I cannot. Which is why it is fortunate that I have no need to copy you.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> What...!?</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> Hehe... Good. It worked.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> You crushed your own heart? Why?</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> You know exactly why.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> If Chaldea comes to save this city, as I trust they will...</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> ...then it is my duty as a Servant to help them however I can.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> Wha... Huh!?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> You&#39;re freakin&#39; nuts! What the hell are you thinking!?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> You&#39;re just throwing your life away for these people without even knowing for sure they&#39;re coming!?</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> Of course.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> I was summoned here as a Rogue Servant.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> It is therefore my obligation to try and save this city.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> It was my fate...nay, let&#39;s just say my duty. So I have no qualms about laying down my life.</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> With me dead, your imitation of me will be imperfect.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> ...A small stone laid upon your path, but one you may well trip over.</p><p><strong>Cursed Arm:</strong> Farewell, savior of this city, whomever you may be. Good luck!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> D-dammit!</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> The hell was that guy&#39;s problem!? The hell was wrong with him!?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> It&#39;d be one thing if he was dying for his master, but for someone he&#39;d never even seen...!?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> How the hell could anyone go out like that!?</p><p><strong>Assassin of Shinjuku:</strong> Dammit, dammit, dammit!!!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...</p><p>It was a shock to my whole Spirit Origin.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I might&#39;ve betrayed some of my other masters at the last moment, but I still considered myself a faithful servant.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> That&#39;s why I knew, beyond any doubt...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...that the sacrifice this Assassin was willing to make wasn&#39;t something just anyone could do.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> What a miserable way to go out. I&#39;ve never been more jealous.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Oh God, it hurts. I can feel my body tearing itself apart!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Master! My master! Why did you go throw your life away with such reckless abandon!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> You were so smart! So intelligent! Why did you die for such meaningless, insignificant glory!?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Why can&#39;t I figure out why you sacrificed yourself!?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...I didn&#39;t get it at all. I had never been so scared in my life.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I had no idea how I should go about repaying my master for saving my life.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I couldn&#39;t think about...anything...anymore...</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> ...So that&#39;s how it is. That \u201Cme\u201D both is and isn&#39;t me.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> He&#39;s my doppelg\xE4nger. A Phantom Spirit who wasn&#39;t even supposed to exist.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> That&#39;s why it was so easy to track him down.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Especially since he&#39;s been haunting me.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Cursed scent mark? Sorry, I was just bullshitting you.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> Does this mean...you and he did not originally share a body then?</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Nah, he&#39;s pretty much just a copy of me.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> I used to be the Assassin of Shinjuku, using my doppelg\xE4nger power to turn into anyone and anything.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> ...But I gradually forgot who I really was, and ended up losing to Master.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> This guy&#39;s just the remains of that version of me, but he ended up sorta linking with the version of me that got summoned to Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> ...Yeah, that&#39;s it. We were linked. Connected.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> That&#39;s why you heard I&#39;d Rayshifted here. He got all mixed up.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> He started thinking he was, well, me, and decided to come back to Shinjuku.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> That&#39;s why I couldn&#39;t forgive myself for what I&#39;d done.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Instead of a gangster who took over Shinjuku, I ended up reverting back into the chivalrous vigilante I always was.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> I mean, you&#39;ve seen for yourself how surprisingly strong my sense of justice is, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> True, you&#39;re the most upstanding vigilante I&#39;ve ever known.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Wahahaha. Thanks for playing along, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I thought you were a vigilante of darkness.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> That&#39;s cool, I guess. They&#39;re both badass!</p><hr><p><strong>Yan Qing (?):</strong> Ahh... Ahhh... I can never atone... I can never make amends...</p><p><strong>Yan Qing (?):</strong> I&#39;ve always survived by...piling up regret after regret... I hate that...about myself...</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> That&#39;s why you wanted to die, and why you tried to kill us.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Because you thought trying to kill us would end with you getting killed instead. Am I wrong?</p><p><strong>Doppelg\xE4nger:</strong> I... I... I&#39;m everyone...and no one...</p><p><strong>Doppelg\xE4nger:</strong> I can be anyone at all, since I lack a core self...yet I also can&#39;t be anything, since I have neither goodwill or malice.</p><p><strong>Doppelg\xE4nger:</strong> I&#39;m nothing more than a hapless wraith who can only survive in the space between darkness and rumor...</p><p><strong>Doppelg\xE4nger:</strong> Which is why...I at least wanted to make amends...</p><p><strong>Doppelg\xE4nger:</strong> And yet...I didn&#39;t want it to cost me my life...</p><p><strong>Doppelg\xE4nger:</strong> So now...I don&#39;t know what to do...</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Come with me then. Hell, that&#39;s the whole reason I&#39;m here: to invite you to join me.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> Oho. So you want to add a Phantom Spirit on top of all your other personalities?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> Sure about that? It might do some damage to your sense of self.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Nah, I&#39;ll be fine. I know who I am. Isn&#39;t that right, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I think you can probably handle it.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Right!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I can&#39;t say I&#39;m not concerned, but...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> Once he has made up his mind, there is no stopping him, huh.</p><hr><p><strong>Doppelg\xE4nger:</strong> A-are you sure? Is it really okay... if I come with you?</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Sure. You&#39;ll help make me stronger.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Just don&#39;t forget how you feel right now. How desperately you&#39;re longing for justice.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Long as you hold onto that, you&#39;ll make a great chivalrous vigilante yet.</p><p><strong>Doppelg\xE4nger:</strong> A vigilante...</p><p><strong>Doppelg\xE4nger:</strong> People who are loyal and considerate to a fault, but with strong enough senses of morality and self to even defy a king...</p><p><strong>Doppelg\xE4nger:</strong> That&#39;s what I...want to be...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;ve confirmed that the doppelg\xE4nger has...not vanished, but became part of Yan Qing.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> His Spirit Origin readings are stable.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> See? Told you I&#39;d be fine.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> Even so, this is quite unusual.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> You should have Da Vinci take a look at you as soon as we get back.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Yup, will do!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> A doppelg\xE4nger who did horrible things in Shinjuku, all because he lacked a personality of his own...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> ...yet who also attempted to do the right thing once he finally had one...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> It&#39;s a miracle that he existed. No doubt it was only made possible thanks to humanity&#39;s current precariousness.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> So I hope you will remember him, Master, even if no one else does.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> It is through your observation that his small tragedy and struggle will live on forever.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> And for him, there could be no greater honor.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Yeah.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Thanks for believing in me right to the end, Master. I appreciate that.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> As long as I&#39;m here, Fujimaru... I&#39;ll keep fighting for you and you alone!</p>',399),a=[s];function g(i,p){return o(),t("div",null,a)}var u=n(e,[["render",g],["__file","Yan Qing.html.vue"]]);export{u as default};
