It&#39;s TOO dark. So dark. Where&#39;s the light?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> And...dammit.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> It hurts...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> My entire body hurts. My chest, my stomach, my back, my arms, my legs, my head, my nose, my inner ears hurt.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The only thing not hurting is my fingers. Otherwise there&#39;s this stabbing pain throughout my entire body.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Who am I? I&#39;m a soldier. Where am I? Am I in the Scutari base camp?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> What the heck? I thought I was on the frontline. So why am I at the base?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...It hurts, it hurts, hurt, hurt, hurt... Oh, that&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I remember. I got shot. I got shot in the chest and stomach, and the bullets passed through my back. And then I broke my arms and legs when I fell. And my head and face, too.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The Russians got me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> May the Ottoman Empire be victorious. Death to the invaders. I need to keep fighting. I can&#39;t face my brothers in this state.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...I can&#39;t move a muscle. What&#39;s going on with me? Am I a goner? Ahhh...it hurts.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Nothing changes even as time goes by. The pain&#39;s not going away. It&#39;s not getting better.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Don&#39;t tell me...am I going to be like this forever? Or am I going to die soon?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...No. I don&#39;t want to die. I can&#39;t die yet.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Ah...I hear it. Footsteps. Has the grim reaper come for me? I can see light...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I can tell someone&#39;s coming towards me carrying a lamp. The darkness is thinning out...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> It&#39;s light. Someone&#39;s here for me.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ANurse:</strong> Oh, good. You&#39;ve come to.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Who the heck are you? And why&#39;re you wearing a British military uniform?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I&#39;ve never heard of a grim reaper wearing a military uniform. Well, everyone who&#39;s seen a grim reaper in person is dead, so they wouldn&#39;t really be telling anyone.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Right, Miss Grim Reaper with the lamp?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ANurse:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Heh. I knew it. I&#39;m gonna die.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Everything hurts. It&#39;s excruciating. Can you see me? I&#39;m crying. I&#39;m crying because it hurts so much.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> But I can&#39;t even make a sound. This is bad. My big brother was a goner. I&#39;m a goner.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Hurry up and take me. I&#39;m gonna...</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ANurse:</strong> Unfortunately, I do not know what you are saying.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ANurse:</strong> But, I will say this:</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ANurse:</strong> I will save you. I will not let you die.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Lies. I&#39;m as good as dead.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I was shot. Multiple times. Only God could save me. Otherwise...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...Or an angel.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> You had a dream?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Why would you tell me of such a thing?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Because Servants and Masters...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Sometimes we are connected by dreams...</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> I see.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Is this about the supernatural? Everyone is entitled to his or her interests, whatever they may be.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> But it is inappropriate to force those interests on others. Understand?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> So, what kind of dream did you see?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Well, here&#39;s what happened...</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> That...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> It is natural for things that interest you to appear in your dreams. You should study neurophysiology more.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Wait a minute...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That&#39;s not from your memory, Nightingale?</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> My memory?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> No. You mentioned that you saw me from a male soldier&#39;s perspective.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> That could not be a memory from my lifetime. Obviously.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> But...the fact that you have taken an interest in me...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Does that mean you have taken an interest in nursing, treatment, and sanitation?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Excellent. In that case...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Hello.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Thank you all for gathering today. I, Florence Nightingale, am extremely pleased.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> You have gathered here today because you all value human life, and all of you have sacrificed on behalf of others. It is my sincere belief that we can have a meaningful, productive discussion.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> For the sake of all human life. For Fujimaru, who has also shown interest.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> And, of course, for each of us as well.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> I&#39;m looking forward to hearing everyone&#39;s input.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> Likewise, Miss Nightingale.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> I am yet inexperienced as a practitioner of medicine, but I hope to be of some small assistance.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> Above all, I would like to learn more, as well.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> ... (Nods)</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong> Hm. I thought this was simply a gathering of beautiful women. Seems I was mistaken.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong> Still, this isn&#39;t terrible. An angel in a white nurse&#39;s outfit, a black-haired beauty, and one very sprightly girl.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong> Ah, what a wonderful selection. A buffet of beauties...the cream of the crop. This isn&#39;t just about being surrounded by beauty; it&#39;s like a harem!</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong> Ah, my apologies. I got a bit overexcited. Just a joke!</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong> This is a gathering for those who want to save people, right?</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong> Well, then I have every reason to be here. I do have a Noble Phantasm that can save lives, after all!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> ... (Nods)</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Um!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> I don&#39;t really get it, but we&#39;re just here to talk about how to save people, right?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Then leave it to me! I have the guidance of the Buddha, so you&#39;re in good hands!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Aw, if I&#39;d known there was a support group like this, I would have dragged Touta here, too.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> So, what are we going to talk about first? The health benefits of fasting?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> ... (Nods deeply)</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fooouuu...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Y-yes, Fou. I sense an indescribable feeling in the air.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I thought this was just discussion group for Servants who have recovery skills...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But it feels more like they&#39;re anxious and getting pumped up to go into the simulator for combat training...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> This is a bit tense for a discussion group...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A-a just point...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Nightingale&#39;s hosting this?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, Senpai. It appears that Nightingale had approached everyone earlier.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> If I may ask...um...is it appropriate to call Sanzang someone with recovery skills?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I don&#39;t believe she has any skills like that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Seems a bit off the mark, yeah.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That&#39;s totally wrong...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Y-yes...and it appears that Fionn believes that everyone but himself is female...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Devotion to helping others is my creed. I search the battlefields after overcoming many obstacles.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> All the injured and sick must be saved. Yes... Life is precious. I must save all lives.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> And to do so, I must let go of all that holds me back or makes me hesitate. Yes...and that&#39;s why...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> First and foremost, hygiene is key. Good hygiene is a bare minimum requirement.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> All affected body parts and the surrounding environment must be sanitary. Uncleanliness is the enemy. It is the enemy of all medical practices.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> Life is precious. And hygiene is indeed very important.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> Very admirable, Miss Nightingale. Truly you are a noble Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> ... (Nods)</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong> Of course, clean water is also important. Any water I pour from these hands of mine becomes water of life...</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong> But yes, water should be clean. That also helps lovely flowers bloom. I agree, my wonderful ladies.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> ... (Nods)</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Eh? What? Clean? Are you talking about washing or cleaning up after yourself?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> I like it when things get cleaned, too.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Whenever I go to an inn, the first thing I do is clean the dust off the bed!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Of course...my disciples always said my room was too messy.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Buuut I really do like it when things are clean! I&#39;d even clean up after myself if someone made me!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> ... (Nods deeply)</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fooou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai, this is...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s like they get it wrong,then do an about-face and get it right somehow.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Nightingale looks satisfied.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Right, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> As unbelievable as it may be, they seem to be on the same page. At least this is a productive conversation!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> All coincidence!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Are they even talking about the same things?</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> I ask myself\uFF1AHow many patients can I save with these hands of mine?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> I am a nurse, not a doctor. There are some out there who say that medicine should be left to doctors.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Sterilizing and disinfecting is sure to increase the chances of survival for the wounded and ill.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> So many lives are in our hands before they ever reach the doctors.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> ...Yes, there were too many...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> That is why I advocate sterilization so much.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Treatment. Nursing. Maintaining hygiene. These are the weapons that we use to defeat the threat of injury and illness.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> We are here to save every life we can.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> Wonderful argument. Hygiene is also important in the world of alchemy.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> When doing biomedical experiments, the patient&#39;s cleanliness and health management are crucial. The same is true in medicine, of course.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> But for you to focus on that subject, and advocate it to spread the word... You really must love humans.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> ... (Nods)</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong> I completely understand!</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong> It&#39;s the same kind of joy I feel when I come across a beautiful stream while I&#39;m hunting deep in the forest!</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong> The delightful sounds of a babbling brook, so like the finest instrument...the sunlight kissing the surface of the water to make it glisten...ah, exquisite!</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong> Just like when I meet a beautiful woman for the first time!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> ... (Nods)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (Eh!? Is that really something to nod at in agreement, Nightingale?)</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> A brook? You&#39;re talking about a river? I love bathing in water! It feels sooo good!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> But...when you talk about a river, I think of fish. Oh, but I&#39;m a disciple of the Buddha though, so I don&#39;t eat meat.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> But I love to watch them. Fishes have these beady eyes that make them sooo cute!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> ... (Nods deeply)</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fooouuu...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m sort of confused about what Nightingale&#39;s been nodding at here tonight.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A-anyway, it doesn&#39;t sound like anybody&#39;s on the same page, but somehow the conversation is still going!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> And now...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Let&#39;s continue our discussion. Well, I would like to, but perhaps we should take a short break.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> It&#39;s time for our practical training. Everyone, ready yourselves.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> To save the injured and sick, sometimes the use of force is necessary. Especially in the face of a threat that may increase the number of patients.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> It is very important.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> Ah, combat training. The medical ward may turn into a battlefield, it seems.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> Some superstitious people have gone deranged after seeing medicine practiced, thinking it to be a ritual of the devil, and attacked the practitioners.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> So in situations like that...yes...the use of force is necessary.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong> Oh? Is it time for me to demonstrate my valor? Perfect!</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong> Honestly, I was starting to think it was time for me to change my flirting approac\u2013err, I mean the topic! Good timing!</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong> Heh. Then let&#39;s do it! I, Fionn mac Cumhaill, shall show off my glorious form!</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong> I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll drive the ladies wild!</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong> And, as luck would have it, I don&#39;t see my annoying subordinate here to mess it up for me!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Eh? What? Battle? Huh? Why?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> I-I&#39;m going to participate too!? I&#39;m beyond surprised!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Please head to the training site.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><span style="font-size:25px;"> IMMEDIATELY!</span></p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fooou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, are we going to battle in the simulator!? Senpai...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Leave it to me!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Yeah, just let them do whatever they want at this point.</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> [\u2642 Mister /\u2640\uFE0F Miss} Fujimaru. You will be playing the role of my subordinate this time. Understood?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Y-yes, ma&#39;am.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;ll do it if you tell me...</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Ready to treat! Repeat!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Ready to treat!</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Very good. Now let&#39;s go. Miss Mash, I leave the operations to you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai. U-um...g-good luck!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> ...Good work.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Now we shall resume our discussion. Please take your seats. Quickly.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Y-yes... Senpai...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> The meeting continues, huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I-I might be a little tired.</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> ...?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> What is the matter? You are looking pale.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Ah, I see. Have you by chance...not had adequate sleep, or not had a proper, balanced meal?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> This is a problem. You are therefore injured.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Change of plans. I will begin treatment. First: sterilization. Then we will maintain the hygienic state.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Rest assured, [\u2642 Mister /\u2640\uFE0F Miss} Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> I will save your life...even if I must first kill you to do so.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> ...I guarantee it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> W-waitaminute!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> No, no...no!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> U-um, you have it wrong, Nightingale. Senpai is neither injured nor sick!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Mash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Y-yes?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> You look pale as well.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> !!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> N-no...that is not true... Not true at all! I am not hurt nor am I sick!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> I will treat you as well.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Nightingale&#39;s...probably...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> She&#39;s more intense than usual!</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fooou!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Name: Fujimaru. Place of employment: Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Breathing, pulse...all normal. No loss of limbs. No issues with the special nervous system, either.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Very good. There are no issues.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> Hmph. Special nerves, you say?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> To you, even the structure the mages call magical circuits is just a type of nerve.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> I see you have had quite the eventful day.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Is this all because someone got a glimpse of your life and you panicked? You, the angel of steel...panic?</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> I caught a glimpse of something rare. Haha, thank you for that.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> ...You.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> I&#39;ll thank you to refrain from superfluous talk. It&#39;s not just Master...this place is overrun with the wounded and potentially ill.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Don&#39;t mind me. Just keep focusing on Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> I&#39;m sure a time will come when your help is needed.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Your words confuse me. I do not comprehend all of what you say...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> But I am a nurse. Nothing more, nothing less.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Hmph.</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Many Heroic Spirits have arisen from human history! Many heroes are men and women of dauntless courage and battlefield valor!</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> But those who heal wounds...Heroic Spirits of salvation. There are not many of those.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> I still do not understand. Why not speak in your own native language?</p><p><strong>Edmond Dant\xE8s:</strong> Heh.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> ...And he flees once again.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Heroic Spirit of salvation... That is quite the overstatement.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> I am simply one who takes joy in treating and nursing others. And at the same time...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> I am also saddened when I see Fujimaru hurt and suffering.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ah!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Good morning, Senpai. It&#39;s a nice morning. Did you sleep well last night?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I think I dreamed of an argument...or...something...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Hm???</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What about you, Mash?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I slept very well. All of my vitals are good.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um, breakfast is ready. Shall we head to the cafeteria?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Actually...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I woke up early, so I helped out Emiya and Boudica in the kitchen today.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Oh, that&#39;s good.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Okay, let&#39;s go to the cafeteria!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Good health comes from a good night&#39;s sleep and a proper, nutritious meal, right!?</p><h2 id="fighting-for-someone" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#fighting-for-someone" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Fighting for Someone</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Welcome back, Senpai!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Welcome back, everyone! Great job out there!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I can see the minute Singularity shrinking even as we speak. That&#39;s one less to worry about.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m glad we took care of it without things getting out of hand.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Me too.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Great job, everyone!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> Hmph, that was so easy I didn&#39;t even need to bother going! Hahaha!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> But don&#39;t forget my tribute, all right? I don&#39;t have to tell you what you need to bring me so I&#39;ll spare your life, do I?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> Heh heh heh, you&#39;d better not ever forget I&#39;m an oni! You can&#39;t just go ordering me around so easily!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> The moment you drop your guard, I&#39;ll eat your head and use your intestines to floss out any bits of skull that get stuck between my fangs. Don&#39;t forget that.</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I won&#39;t.</p><hr><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> Mwahaha, so you do know your place! Not bad!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> ...Anyway, hurry up and do something about that one. She&#39;s been acting weird and it&#39;s bugging me.</p><hr><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> ...Have you noticed, Master?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> I was watching while we were in battle, and she was far less active than usual.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...I noticed.</p><hr><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> Florence Nightingale.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> I&#39;ve never seen her be so passive in battle before. I did not notice any affliction or wound that might explain it.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> There may be something wrong with her Spirit Origin. We should treat her at once.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> You should let Da Vinci know about this, just in case.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> What are you talking about?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> I was? In that last battle?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> ...That&#39;s right. Twice, there was an enemy right in front of you, and you didn&#39;t lift a finger to attack them.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> You would not normally allow yourself to be so passive. Are you aware you were acting like that?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t understand what you mean. It&#39;s not my job to fight. I&#39;m a nurse, not a soldier.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Though of course, that doesn&#39;t mean I won&#39;t fight should it become necessary.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> There may well be times when I&#39;m pinned down, unable to reach relief supplies right in front of me.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> So in circumstances like that...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> ...I&#39;m sure I would do whatever was necessary to remove the obstacles in my way.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> If it came down to it, I would have no hesitation about drawing a gun and pulling the trigger. Of that, I&#39;m certain.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> But...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> ...enemy or not, to do that would be to cause injury with my own hands.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> And nothing could be further from what I want.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Listen, Commander, that others think of me as a small army unto myself does not make me an officer.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> I&#39;m not here because I want to win wars. All I want is for the fighting to stop.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> I...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> I want to save lives.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> As long as I can do that, I don&#39;t care about the rest...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Nightingale...</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> ...(Gasp!)</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Nnn, I can&#39;t remember how I got here. Weren&#39;t we just fighting golems?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Are we back in Chaldea now? We are, aren&#39;t we? What have I been doing...?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> You were telling us how you aren&#39;t a soldier. That is certainly true, of course, but... Hmm.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> I knew it. Something is wrong with her Spirit Origin, Master.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> I see.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Yes, I must not be feeling well. I will go rest.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Nightingale?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Nightingale!?</p><p><strong>Gentleman:</strong> ...Are you listening to me, Florence?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Yes. I&#39;m listening.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> We were just talking about the front line&#39;s medical supply situation. I need your help, Sidney.</p><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong> Oh for... I knew it! You aren&#39;t listening to me at all, Florence! Do you even realize where you are!?</p><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong> This is London! The capital of the entire British Empire! You aren&#39;t on the battlefield anymore, Florence.</p><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong> But it&#39;s clear to me that your heart is still there. Just look at you.</p><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong> I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re wearing an army uniform. You don&#39;t even work for them...</p><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong> I won&#39;t ask what happened while you were there, but this is London, Florence. London.</p><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong> Do you understand? You can&#39;t go around behaving like this.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> ...I dress this way for a reason.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> You may find it strange. Maybe it is strange. But I&#39;m fighting too, just like those soldiers.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> I&#39;ll never stop fighting against the illness and injury plaguing our world. This uniform is more than appropriate for that.</p><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong> You&#39;ll never stop fighting...?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> That&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong> Ahh...</p><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong> Don&#39;t do this to yourself anymore, Florence. Please. I&#39;m begging you.</p><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong> You haven&#39;t been the Angel of Crimea for a long time now. You don&#39;t have to keep fighting any longer.</p><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong> It&#39;s time to focus on your own life now. What about... What about marriage?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Sidney?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> What in the world are you talking about? You know nobody can get married on their own.</p><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong> ...That&#39;s not what I mean, and you know it.</p><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong> How long are you going to keep pretending not to know?</p><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong> I haven&#39;t been helping solely out of the goodness of my heart, Florence. Everything I&#39;ve done has been for you...</p><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong> For years now, I...</p><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong> I&#39;ve always lo\u2013</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> No. This is wrong. It&#39;s a lie.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Sidney Herbert was my friend. He was already married. This conversation never happened. It couldn&#39;t have.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> No. It&#39;s not just that.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> In all my life, nobody ever told me they loved me...</p><p><strong>Voice:</strong> I see.</p><p><strong>Voice:</strong> I always thought your way of life was...bizarre, but now, you&#39;ve started seeing cracks in your own facade.</p><p><strong>Voice:</strong> Heh. Fascinating.</p><p><strong>Voice:</strong> But...I&#39;m not about to let you dig your own grave.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> You have horrid taste in hobbies.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Do you always go around spying on women while they&#39;re sleeping?</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong> ...Hmph.</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong> Most Servants don&#39;t sleep at all, let alone dream.</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong> That you are here, now, doing both makes plain that something is wrong with your Spirit Origin.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong> Generally speaking, all of Chaldea&#39;s Servants are linked to Master. It&#39;s no wonder that sometimes lines may get a little blurred.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> How dare you say that to me?</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong> Something like this has happened to you before, hasn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> That wasn&#39;t me. It was Fujimaru who...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Yes. It has.</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong> Nice to see you be direct about it.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> It&#39;s clear what is going on here. There&#39;s no point in denying it.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> ...I must be mentally injured.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Heroic Spirits...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> ...are usually created when a human being ascends beyond their humanity. At this point, they have yet to be assigned a class.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> For one thing, the very concept of classes only arose as a byproduct of the Heroic Spirit Summoning Ritual.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Naturally, Chaldea&#39;s summoning system follows the same principles, typically assigning each Heroic Spirit one of the seven classes.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> But there are, of course, exceptions to this rule. Most potential problems can be avoided if there is an appropriate Extra class to which the Heroic Spirit can be assigned...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> ...but there may also be times when a Heroic Spirit is forced into a class for which they may not be fully suited.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Such cases can certainly become cause for distortion of one sort of another.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Uh... And that means what, exactly?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Could you try that again, only way, waaay simpler?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> ...The Ms. Nightingale we know is a Berserker.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> She is clearly a fighter, with her struggles to save lives as a nurse now manifesting in more literal terms.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> But is that who she truly is? Was she always so obstinate during her life as a human woman?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Or is the fierce devotion we see in her a caricature of her true self, exaggerated to fit her Berserker class?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> If the latter, she will continue to strain her mind and Spirit Origin for the length of her materialization.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Then, I&#39;ve been forcing her to be something she&#39;s not all this time...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> N-not necessarily!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I know that in my case, I never felt like I was under any strain.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So maybe it&#39;s similar for\u2013</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> As a Demi-Servant, Ms. Kyrielight, your circumstances are even more unusual.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Thus, I&#39;m afraid your argument may not hold much water in this case.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Ugh, not again, Holmes. You really can be kind of a twat sometimes, you know that?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Can I now?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You don&#39;t have to put it like that. Summoning a Heroic Spirit with a mind of their own has always been a huge deal.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> And it&#39;s especially difficult to maintain a contract with a Berserker. This is KNOWN.</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong> ...It makes no difference to me.</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong> Let&#39;s go, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Wha\u2013</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong> Take care of [\u2642 his /\u2640\uFE0F her} body, girl. Er, Mash Kyrielight.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> W-wait! What are you talking about, Count!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ah! Senpai!</p><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong> Ah, [\u2642 Mr. /\u2640\uFE0F Miss} Fujimaru! Excellent timing!</p><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong> Please, would you say something to Florence? I can&#39;t seem to get through to her myself.</p><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong> But maybe she&#39;ll listen to you, since you&#39;re one of her colleagues.</p><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong> Go on! Please, say something!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> ... ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> J-just a minute!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What is this place...</p><hr><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong> You are seeing her mind as it is now. Normally you would only see this in your dreams.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So this is Nightingale&#39;s...</p><hr><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong> That&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong> Are you all right, [\u2642 Mr. /\u2640\uFE0F Miss} Fujimaru? Your eyes seemed to glaze over for a moment.</p><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong> Please, you have to talk to Florence. She needs to rest up and return to her normal life.</p><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong> She only just got back from the war, and she&#39;s still intent on fighting. She can&#39;t keep going like this.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Um...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;m sorry, do I know you?</p><hr><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong> He&#39;s nobody.</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong> Remember, she&#39;s a Berserker. Most of her rational mind was sealed away when she materialized.</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong> Ordinary people could never keep the fires of battle raging in their hearts at all times, but that&#39;s not the case for Berserkers.</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong> However, that of course comes at a cost.</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong> There&#39;s something that builds up deep down inside Berserkers over time.</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong> Especially in the ones who still speak with some semblance of sanity!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong> It becomes twisted, warped, distorted. At times, it can even manifest.</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong> Sometimes, it appears as a monster who wants nothing more than to follow its destructive impulses and lay waste to everything around it...</p><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong> ...and sometimes, it embodies reason in the shape of an old friend!</p><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong> She needs to rest now. She shouldn&#39;t push herself anymore.</p><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong> Come now, Florence, think about it. There&#39;s no reason to do this to yourself.</p><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong> Don&#39;t you agree, [\u2642 Mr. /\u2640\uFE0F Miss} Fujimaru!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Maybe you&#39;re right.</p><hr><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong> Of course I am!</p><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong> So she should stop this right\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> But not yet.</p><hr><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong> What was that...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I want to keep fighting beside her until the very end.</p><hr><p><strong>Sidney Herbert:</strong> What!?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> ...So that&#39;s your wish, Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Very well then, I accept your request. I will return to the battlefield to save as many lives as I can.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> If helping those in need requires me to do violence, then so be it.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Good grief. I guess you&#39;re no better than me in some ways, Commander.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Your desire to remain on the battlefield with me can&#39;t be healthy. I must cure you of it...some day.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Works for me.</p><hr><p><strong>Count of Monte Cristo:</strong> I see your appearance has changed. Not bad.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> So it has. I didn&#39;t mean for my hair to come undone...but perhaps it suits who I am now.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> If I&#39;m to embrace my Berserker self...then I must admit this is who I am.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> A wild woman, hair untamed, saving every life she can without regard for her own safety.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> This is who I truly am right now.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> All right then, Commander. No...Master. First, I&#39;ll need your help with something.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> The temporary excision of this fragment of rationality masquerading as an old friend.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You got it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Let the healing begin!</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Good. Very well then...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Start the treatment!!!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Good morning. ...I see you have more or less awoken on schedule today.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> It&#39;s been a week since your last morning exam, so I&#39;d like you to come to the infirmary for a follow-up.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Mash Kyrielight is already on standby there, so do try to hurry.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Now, if you&#39;ll excuse me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Nightingale!</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Yes?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...G-good morning.</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Yes, it is a good morning.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> ...Thank you again for fighting by my side, Master.</p>',511),a=[s];function i(g,h){return e(),o("div",null,a)}var l=t(r,[["render",i],["__file","Florence Nightingale.html.vue"]]);export{l as default};
