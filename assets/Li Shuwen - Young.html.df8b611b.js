Hngh! Hngh!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hmmm...I heard \u201CDivine Spear\u201D Li Shuwen was training, so I dropped by to see what kind of rigorous regimen he was putting himself through...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> To be honest, it&#39;s pretty plain.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Th-that&#39;s rude, Da Vinci!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> Kaka! You&#39;re right about it being plain.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You admit it?</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> My purpose is to hone each and every one of my skills.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> The truth is, if you rip out someone&#39;s heart, they&#39;ll die every time.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> ...But it&#39;s not that simple now that I&#39;ve become a Servant. Still, death is inevitable even for us if our Spirit Core is destroyed.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> So, learning a new move as a Servant seems like a waste of time.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> Honing skills I already have makes a lot more sense.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Rather than learning a hundred skills, choosing to refining one skill to perfection... I do notice that seems to be a common approach among Servants.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Although, there are also a lot of kings who are experts in all kinds of martial arts...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> They have different roles to play after they become king, after all.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> An expert begins their journey at a time and place of their choosing, but a king does not often have the ability to make those choices.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> You&#39;re right. Rama often lamented that.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> \u201CI&#39;m actually better versed in archery... But if Saber is the best, as king that is what I must choose.\u201D</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> ...Is what he said.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I wonder why... There are kings who manifested as Archers and Riders here.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Ah, no, no. Gilgamesh is basically his own class. I wouldn&#39;t even call him an Archer.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> And the King of Conquerors is a Rider mostly in the sense of standing astride his people.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> And in that same sense, Queen Medb... Actually, let&#39;s not talk about that. It&#39;s probably not appropriate to talk about that in front of Mash!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> By the way, did Rama choose to be a Saber class because it really is the best?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> No, it&#39;s because he&#39;s a romantic at heart. Anyway, we digress.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> Okay, Master. Thanks for waiting while I trained.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> Want to head out to town for a breather?</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> Hm? What&#39;s all the commotion?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It seems like it&#39;s coming from the town square.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Is something happening?</p><hr><p><strong>Civilian:</strong> You don&#39;t know? A renowned martial artist from the East is apparently here.</p><p><strong>Civilian:</strong> He&#39;s an amazing lancer, and he has tons of disciples. I&#39;m heading over there to check them out!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Oh? A martial artist in this land is a rare sight indeed.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> Hmmm...a renowned martial artist, huh? Master, want to check them out to kill some time?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Sounds good!</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> Kaka! That&#39;s the spirit!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Um...</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> We&#39;re just gonna get a glimpse. A glimpse.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Do you think it&#39;s all right?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fooou...</p><p><strong>Renowned Martial Artist:</strong> HahaHA!!! Secret technique: Ultimate Muso Lance!!! This is unilateral, mind you!</p><p><strong>Renowned Martial Artist&#39;s Disciple:</strong> See our master&#39;s lance technique!? These are numerous unilateral techniques that branch from an egocentric dance!!!</p><p><strong>Renowned Martial Artist&#39;s Disciple:</strong> He&#39;s the greatest martial artist who&#39;s never lost after one hundred battles! Whoooo!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What the hell are you doing, mustache face!?</p><hr><p><strong>Women:</strong> Kyaaah! Amazing (somewhat).</p><p><strong>Renowned Martial Artist:</strong> Gufufufufu.</p><p><strong>Renowned Martial Artist:</strong> I wanted the North American ladies to go gaga over me as a martial artist brimming with oriental flavor! My plan worked flawlessly!</p><p><strong>Renowned Martial Artist&#39;s Disciple:</strong> You think so? At least you haven&#39;t fumbled yet...</p><p><strong>Renowned Martial Artist:</strong> The longest journey begins with a single step!</p><p><strong>Women:</strong> Kyaaah! Amazing (use of a proverb)!</p><p><strong>Renowned Martial Artist:</strong> But I haven&#39;t come across a maiden who&#39;s totally my type.</p><p><strong>Renowned Martial Artist:</strong> Ah, is there no maiden out there who could see the true, real me?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You&#39;re way off from looking like someone from the East... Actually you totally look Western...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> And you&#39;re not even a Lancer!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> First and foremost, what is that idiot doing here?</p><p><strong>Renowned Martial Artist&#39;s Disciple:</strong> For a special price, you can get a personal lesson from our great master!!! First come, first served!</p><p><strong>Claque:</strong> Hey! I&#39;d better get in on this!</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Be calm. Be cool.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What should we do?</p><hr><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> Oh, I&#39;m not mad. This is in such poor taste, it&#39;s not worth watching.</p><p><strong>Renowned Martial Artist&#39;s Disciple:</strong> What? I just heard something inexcusable! Are you nit-picking at this captain&#39;s\u2013I mean the master Lancer&#39;s skills?</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> It&#39;s a cheap trick, no more than a show of brute strength. Everything about it is wrong. You need to start afresh by swinging a hoe around!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Please, go back to the sea.</p><p><strong>Renowned Martial Artist&#39;s Disciple:</strong> What did you say!? Master, beat &#39;em up!</p><p><strong>Renowned Martial Artist:</strong> Eh? Wait. I know where this is going...</p><p><strong>Renowned Martial Artist:</strong> Aww, man! I&#39;m about to get my ass kicked, aren&#39;t I? Ahhhh!!!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> Hmnf!</p><p><strong>Renowned Martial Artist:</strong> Meooowww! (Chicken)</p><p><strong>Renowned Martial Artist&#39;s Disciple:</strong> Oh, master&#39;s collapsed gushing blood from all his orifices! You bastards!!!</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> ...That&#39;s all it took? What a waste of time.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That was a wonderful single shot.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Amazing!</p><hr><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> Hm. From the teachings of Bajiquan...actually, this is my thought...</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> \u201CFear not the one who knows a thousand skills, but rather the one who has obtained mastery of one.\u201D</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> You should be more fearful of those who have polished a single skill rather than those who possess one thousand skills.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I see. That&#39;s why you keep training and practice the same skills over and over.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This can be applied to Noble Phantasms, which are a manifestation of Heroic Spirits&#39; legends.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> Master, never forget that yourself. The truly terrifying adversaries, no matter which path they&#39;ve taken, are those who have reached their peak.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;ll keep that in mind.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;ll try my best!</p><hr><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> Hahaha... Now then. Shall we go out for some tea... No, in this land, it would be alcohol.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> I don&#39;t often drink either, but let&#39;s get going.</p><p><strong>Man:</strong> Hey. You trying to pick a fight?</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> Sorry, I got too excited, but I don&#39;t feel bad.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> He was the one who picked the fight.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> He&#39;s just knocked out, so I think he should be all right.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But please be careful. The people in that bar seem unusually worked up.</p><p><strong>Child A:</strong> It&#39;s true! That huge and hugely famous martial artist is here!</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> ...Hm?</p><p><strong>Child A:</strong> He&#39;s skinny and glares like a wolf! And he acts all big!</p><p><strong>Child B:</strong> That&#39;s a lie! Someone like that wouldn&#39;t come to some backward nowhere place like this!</p><p><strong>Child A:</strong> It&#39;s true! Come on, I&#39;ll show you!</p><p><strong>Child B:</strong> Fine!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A \u201Chuge\u201D martial artist?</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> Hm. I can&#39;t allow the children to be exposed to bad influences.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> He&#39;s likely a fake like the one we saw earlier. Let&#39;s go, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Mister Shuwen, do you like kids?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Oh? It does seem so.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> ...No. I started to like children after I reached old age.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Mister Shuwen. You liked kids, right?</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> Well, perhaps a bit.</p><hr><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> As I am now, though, I am more a hungry wolf than an aged tiger.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> I&#39;m not up to teaching kids martial arts right now.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> At any rate, let&#39;s go see this fake martial artist...</p><p><strong>ZHuge Martial Artist:</strong> That would be me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What are you doing here?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Seriously, what are you doing here?</p><hr><p><strong>ZHuge Martial Artist:</strong> ...Hm. Truthfully, I myself do not know why I am here.</p><p><strong>ZHuge Martial Artist:</strong> I am beginning to suspect the horrid possibility that I was summoned here as a one-off joke.</p><p><strong>Child A:</strong> Hey it&#39;s him! Hey! Show us your martial arts!</p><p><strong>ZHuge Martial Artist:</strong> ...So there you have it, Li Shuwen. If possible, I would appreciate it if you would demonstrate your martial skills.</p><p><strong>ZHuge Martial Artist:</strong> My falling rocks and flaming fans would be a poor example of martial arts to the children.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> ...This will make you the heel in their eyes. Do you mind?</p><p><strong>ZHuge Martial Artist:</strong> Better that than for them to mistake me for a martial artist.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> You&#39;re right. Then let&#39;s do this!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Zhuge Martial Artist:</strong> I. Have. Been. Defeated. (Monotone)</p><p><strong>Child A:</strong> He&#39;s STRONG!!!</p><p><strong>Child B:</strong> That single spear broke through those weird beams and rocks! Whoa!!!</p><p><strong>Child A:</strong> Hey, mister! Do you think we can do that too?</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> Hm, who knows? Maybe you can...</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> But in order to do so, it&#39;s important to live your life with sincerity every day. There&#39;s also a saying: \u201Cwith persistence a drop of water hollows out the stone.\u201D</p><p><strong>Child A:</strong> I get it. My mommy tells me not to be lazy too!</p><p><strong>Child B:</strong> But we came over to watch this while we were on an errand for mommy.</p><p><strong>Child A:</strong> Oh...</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> Hahaha. That is fine.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> Of course, if you continue to act idly...like that man, such things will come back to bite you later.</p><p><strong>Zhuge Martial Artist:</strong> (Sigh) I truly got the short end of the stick here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Good work...</p><hr><p><strong>Zhuge Martial Artist:</strong> That aside. Shuwen, I sense a Servant nearby.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, you&#39;re right. That&#39;s amazing.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> Hm. Has someone connected to me been summoned?</p><p><strong>Zhuge Martial Artist:</strong> That may be why I was pulled into this.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> Children. Remember to train in your art every day.</p><p><strong>Children:</strong> Okay!</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> ...This is...</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> What happenstance. What luck.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> I cannot hold myself back!</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> Hahaha!</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> I see now. My manifestation here seems to have affected things... Guess I caused a bit of trouble, huh?</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> Either way. Here I am, and here we meet.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> So, we&#39;ve got no choice, do we, true martial artist?</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> Indeed. An opportunity like this\u2013no...there will never be an opportunity like this ever again.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> I never imagined I would come face to face with something out of legend!</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Those glaring eyes like a tiger-wolf. You are, without question, THE Li Shuwen!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s a good thing the children are gone...</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> Kaka. Yes, my fists are deadly.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> People said what they wanted about me while I lived, but they were all correct.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> How could I call myself a martial artist if battle didn&#39;t get my blood pumping?</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Ah...this is why battle freaks are a pain. I suppose I must admit that I&#39;m no different.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Take my fierce, swift shadow fist as your parting gift to return you to the afterlife!</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Fist of Yan Qing...take it if you can!</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> Haa! With my spear or with my bare hands, I am not wanting for weapons! The skill I worked to achieve for my entire life shall be unleashed!</p><p><strong>Both:</strong> Brace yourself!!!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> Surging! Surging!!! More! Show me more!!! Truly a violent fist!!! Can art reach the true pinnacle!?</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Hahahaha! You&#39;re too slow, brute of a Lancer!</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Nothing wrong with saving it all for one strike, but your emotions have gotten the better of you. I see through you!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hmmm. I&#39;m getting dizzy just watching this! I can&#39;t tell who&#39;s got the upper hand!</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> Hot-blooded...not a problem! To be called a divine spear and keep cool... I am not there yet!</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> But it&#39;s still not enough! Not enough! A true violent spear is one that would crush a swift fist!</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> If not, I would be embarrassed to even use my second name of \u201CDivine Spear\u201D!</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> There!</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> That&#39;s nothing!</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> Hm... This is the end. Even with the benefit of my spear...I stand here at a disadvantage.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> Perhaps I need to abandon my second name of \u201CDivine Spear\u201D...</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Sheesh. My other name is the Skillful Star.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> With that flimsy spear against my fists, you managed to dodge, parry, and attack...</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Just when I thought your attacks were almost too direct, you start throwing in whimsical twists... Let me guess: you&#39;ve got a bad personality, right?</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> Of course. Same goes with you.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> I can see your wicked personality through your fists and footwork, Skillful Star, Yan Qing.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Both:</strong> Wahahahahahah!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Neither of them were holding back...</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> Ah, that was great training.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Training?</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> Indeed. Training. Although, it would have been a fight to the death if we had kept going. There are so many things that I still lack.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> I will polish my spear skills by fighting in the coming battles.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> Skillful Star, Yan Qing, I&#39;d like a rematch one of these days.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Hahaha! Nice! That&#39;s why I love martial artists!</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Fine, fine! I swear by Tianqiao, I&#39;ll sweep your spear AND your fists aside!</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Okay. Now to deepen our friendship, let&#39;s go out drinking!</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> No, not at a drinking hole. Shall we go out to play a round of Go in the bamboo forest?</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> ...You&#39;ve got the taste of an old man.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> I just don&#39;t like to drink...and not only alcohol. Tea especially.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Sheesh. Guess I have no choice! I&#39;ll go along with what you want today.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> But in exchange, next time you&#39;re gonna have to do what I want! We&#39;re gonna drink, eat, sing, and dance!</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong> Hm. In that, I too will have no choice. Well, pardon me on the singing and dancing part, okay?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Did they just become friends?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Looks like it.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s good, Senpai. Since they&#39;re both martial artists, I&#39;m sure they have lots in common.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Once their game of Go is done, let&#39;s all Rayshift home.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Good work!</p>',228),a=[r];function i(h,g){return e(),o("div",null,a)}var l=t(s,[["render",i],["__file","Li Shuwen - Young.html.vue"]]);export{l as default};
