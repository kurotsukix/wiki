War</h2><p><strong>A：???:</strong> ...Everyone has regrets.</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong> “If it only could be like this.” “If only I&#39;d done that.” Nobody makes it through life without having such thoughts at least once.</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong> Given that failure is an inevitable part of life, there is no sense dwelling on it.</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong> But of course, dwell we do, don&#39;t we!</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong> Yours truly is no exception!</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong> So for today, I would like to spin you a story of regret.</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong> It&#39;s all well and good to have regrets.</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong> But if you try to rid yourself of them, there will be hell to pay like you cannot even begin to fathom.</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong> That&#39;s the sort of comical fable I have in mind for us today!</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong> Ah, this does bring back memories, doesn&#39;t it, Master!</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong> That&#39;s right, it&#39;s me! James Moriarty, everyone&#39;s favorite old man from an alternate dimension.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Huh? You want me to take this more seriously? All right, if you insist.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...My name is James Moriarty. I am also known variously as the Napoleon of crime and the Old Spider.</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong> Oh, I do beg your pardon. Where are my manners, rambling on in front of a Master I&#39;ve never met before.</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong> You don&#39;t even know who I am just yet, do you? Hehehe...</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong> ...My name is James Moriarty. I am also known variously as the Napoleon of crime and the Old Spider.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> And now, I am your Servant.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> So, now that that&#39;s out of the way, you are officially invited on a fun little pleasure trip! Don&#39;t worry, the risk of losing your life is almost completely negligible!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Just sit back, relax, and enjoy this stroll down Regret Lane!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Waaahahahaha!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Did I just get forcefully Rayshifted again...!?</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What is this place...?</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Goood morning!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Not so loooud!</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Oh, I do beg your pardon! Hello and good day!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I&#39;m glad to see you in good health, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I can see, though, that you are wondering where you are.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I&#39;ll come right to the point then! We are lost in this Rayshift, you and I!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> We have no way to ask for help, nor any means to receive it.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> That is to say, we are now on a stealth mission, and all weapons and equipment must be procured on-site!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Where have I heard this before...</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Indeed. We now face the same harsh circumstances as an MI6 covert operative. I&#39;ve heard of wholesale delegation, but this is ridiculous.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> But worry not, Master. I know this world, and I recognize the time period in which we find ourselves.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> In fact, I believe that is why I am the one who is here with you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So, we&#39;re here because of you, Professor?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Well, uh... I suppose you could say that...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> So, we&#39;re here because of you, Grandpa?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I will have you know that I am only in my fifties, thank you VERY much! There is nary a grandpa to be found here!</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> All right, allow me to explain.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> We are currently in a mansion found in a certain European city.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> It is the late nineteenth century, though without a newspaper, I cannot be certain of the date.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Our cover story is that you and I are bartenders employed at this mansion.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Are you with me so far?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That explains these outfits...</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> And may I say, they suit us rather well!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Now then... Hehehe, here is the problem we face!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Hmm. On second thought, perhaps it would be better if you see for yourself.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Let&#39;s leave the bar for the moment and take a stroll around the mansion itself.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Oh, and as a rule of thumb, I would strongly advise you to keep your voice low and not speak to anyone.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...At least, for now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Whoa, this place is fancy!</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Yes, this mansion&#39;s owner is something of a local legend. He effectively runs this entire city.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> And just look around. He must be at the center of any number of deplorably immoral and, dare I say, criminal acts to afford such luxury!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Hey now, Mr. Moriarty.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I can&#39;t speak for my ancestors, but I certainly have no recollection of being involved in anything of the sort.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (This is the mansion&#39;s owner...?)</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Hahahaha, forgive me. I was just having a bit of fun.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (Sieg!?)</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> (This is not the Sieg you know from Chaldea. Make sure you speak to him as though he were a complete stranger.)</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Fujimaru, this is our employer, Sieg.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Nice to meet you, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I&#39;m afraid you won&#39;t have much time to get your feet wet. Things are about to get very busy around here.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Make sure that you treat all of our guests with the respect they deserve.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Whatever you do, do not speak to them as though you are on friendly or familiar terms.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> As long as you remember that, you&#39;re free to handle your responsibilities however you see fit.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Oh, and Mr. Moriarty? I&#39;m counting on you to take care of that matter we discussed earlier.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...And now you have met our employer.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What&#39;s Sieg doing here...?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> That will become clear once you see the guests we are about to meet.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Who are these guests he mentioned...?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Good question. We will be paying them a visit shortly as well.</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> At peril of sounding like a broken record...do try to contain your surprise.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> Well, well.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> I&#39;m surprised to see a thug like you here, seeing how the only thing you&#39;re good for is guzzling cheap booze.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> It breaks my heart to see Lord Sieg disgrace himself with his poor choice of company.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> Ha. I&#39;m sorry, did you say something, old-timer? I could barely hear you over the sound of your bones creaking.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> If there&#39;s anyone who doesn&#39;t deserve to be at this mansion, it&#39;s the worthless fossil who can&#39;t even set foot on a damn boat.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Whoa, whoa, easy there, fellas.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Sieg invited us all here, remember?</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> So who cares about disgrace or worth! The important thing is, we all have the same qualifications to be here!</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> ...Besides, none of us is ready now. Hell, they haven&#39;t even gotten here yet, right?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> ...Hmph. And here comes the hyena.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Ooh, hyena, huh. I like that. They&#39;re the ones who always come out on top, seeing how they thrive off dead meat.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> ... ...Tch.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> ...Well, no matter. We still have some time until the auction.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> If I were you, Yan Qing and Izo, I&#39;d think long and hard about what I want to do with my life between now and the auction starting.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Right on. Thanks for the tip!</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> Funny, I was about to tell you the same thing.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> ...But then again, I guess there isn&#39;t much point in you thinking about what you want to do with your life.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> At your age, all you&#39;ve got left to do is pick out a burial plot.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So Diarmuid, Yan Qing, and Izo are all here, too...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Yes, but keep in mind that they are not at all the people you know.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Wait a minute. Is this what I think it is...?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Very astute, Fujimaru. Yes, I believe it&#39;s exactly as you suspect.</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Perhaps you remember what happened during a similar incident not so long ago? A mystery of sorts at the Kogetsukan, yes?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Back then, I believe your brain substituted figures you were familiar with for those whom you had never met...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...so as to avoid overwhelming it with new visual information.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> This time, the new figures may share their names with the ones you know, but in all other respects, it is the same phenomenon at work.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What do they look like to you then, Moriarty?</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Ah, yes. Unfortunately, they appear to be the same Servants to me as well.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> But there are some...extenuating circumstances that give me a bit more insight into their true identities.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...Simply put, these three...ah, gentlemen are gang leaders.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Diarmuid may not look the part, but I trust you can sort of see it with the other two, no?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Well... Yeah, pretty much.</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> As for Diarmuid, I imagine he was chosen because his looks and attributes are similar to those of the man he&#39;s standing in for.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> After all, his dapper looks have apparently made him quite the talk of the town as of late.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> And they don&#39;t get along very well, do they?</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Indeed not.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Diarmuid&#39;s group has been based in this area for many years now, a gang with a long tradition.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> They have their hands in every single one of this city&#39;s dark dealings and secrets, but they&#39;re also considered a pillar of the community.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Then, about twenty years ago, Yan Qing&#39;s gang came along and put paid to that peaceful state of affairs.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> As soon as they came into the city, they were very aggressive about taking on whatever dirty work they could find...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...including the type of jobs that Diarmuid&#39;s gang had long refused even to touch.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Naturally, this led to turf war after turf war, with both sides gunning for each other around the city.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> That state of affairs continued for several years until about three years ago, when both sides decided to put an end to these killings and came to terms.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> That was when Izo&#39;s gang of longshore workers came along and complicated things further.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Now, all three of these gangs are in a stalemate, ever at odds with one another.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Oh? You seem puzzled by something. Well, I suppose I can&#39;t blame you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Why couldn&#39;t two of the gangs just team up?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Unfortunately, that&#39;s easier said than done!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> You see, each of the three gangs has something unique holding them back.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> How come the weakest gang didn&#39;t get wiped out?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Indeed, eliminating the weakest opposition is a classic for a reason.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> But in this case, each of the three gangs has something unique keeping them safe, even as it holds them back.</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Diarmuid&#39;s group has numbers on their side, and they&#39;re also the ones most entrenched in the city.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> But in this case, that strength is also a weakness.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> As long as he remains here, Diarmuid needs to keep up his image of a chivalrous man about town.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> That makes his group old and staid, unable to make the bold moves necessary to remove the others.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Whereas Yan Qing&#39;s group is the newcomer that arrived in the city long after the status quo had been established.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> The people of this city are highly unlikely to ever trust them...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...but in turn, that gives them the freedom to do whatever they want.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> As this city was never theirs, they feel no obligation to restrain themselves on its behalf.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> And finally, we have Izo&#39;s gang.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> They have the fewest numbers, but they also control the docks.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> And since this city&#39;s industry depends on those docks, the other gangs can&#39;t do much to hurt them.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Do you follow me so far?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I think so...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Good. Because it only gets more complicated from here!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> This is getting a lot more complicated!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Very well, let&#39;s see if we can&#39;t make it simpler...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Diarmuid controls the biggest gang, Yan Qing the medium-sized one...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...and Izo the smallest. That is the key takeaway.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Does that help make it clearer?</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Now then, I think we had best adjourn the lecture now in favor of doing our job for a bit.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What is our job, exactly?</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> On another note!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> We&#39;ve got wyverns!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Where&#39;d that come from!?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> That was the second most popular line in the “Things I&#39;ve Always Wanted To Say” portion of the Servant Census.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Da Vinci put it together herself.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Moriarty?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Please don&#39;t look at me like that!</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> In a strange twist of fate, it seems there are wyverns running–or rather, flying, around in this time period!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> The little devils apparently like to sneak into this mansion, so Sieg has entrusted us with keeping them out!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That is REALLY strange, you know!</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Well, I do have an inkling or two as to how this state of affairs came to be...but for the moment, I think we had best focus on the wyverns at hand!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> All right, Master, I&#39;m counting on you for backup!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> How were THOSE wyverns!?</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Indeed, it seems matters are even stranger than I expected...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Regardless, it does seem the part about them invading this mansion was true.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> And it would certainly make things worse to have Demonic Beasts causing trouble now, while the gangs are already at odds with one another.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Good grief... All this, and it still hasn&#39;t even begun!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What hasn&#39;t begun?</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...Heh heh heh.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> The answer to that...will have to wait. Why, you ask?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Hold on, let me just put on my disguise here...</p><p><strong>Holmes?:</strong> Because!</p><p><strong>Holmes?:</strong> The time!</p><p><strong>Holmes?:</strong> Is not yet right!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> End of story!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Was the disguise really necessary?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Seems like an awful lot of trouble for so little payoff...</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Heh. I&#39;d say it was well worth it just to see you roll your eyes like that, Master.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Incidentally, that line took third place in the aforementioned Servant Census.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Which, once again, was put together by Da Vinci herself.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Boy, that really grinds my gears!</p><h2 id="section-2-triangle-gang" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-triangle-gang" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 2: Triangle Gang</h2><p><strong>Gang Member C:</strong> Oi, gimme more booze!</p><p><strong>Gang Member B:</strong> Me too! C&#39;mon, hurry it up!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> C-coming!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Be right with you!</p><hr><p><strong>Gang Member A:</strong> Tch... I see you lot are just as disgraceful as ever.</p><p><strong>Gang Member C:</strong> Oi, what&#39;d you just say!?</p><p><strong>Gang Member B:</strong> Keep your goddamn mouth shut if ya know what&#39;s good for ya, gramps!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> All right, gentlemen, that is quite enough of that.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Let me remind you that it is my employer you would be inconveniencing if you fought here...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...and that would certainly not be to any of your advantages.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> At least, in my humble opinion.</p><p><strong>Gang Member A:</strong> ...Hmph. Fine, whatever...</p><p><strong>Gang Member B:</strong> You&#39;ve got a lotta nerve talkin&#39; to me like that, bartender...</p><p><strong>Gang Member C:</strong> Hahahaha! Just goes to show how nobody respects you lot!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Fuhahahaha, it&#39;s wonderful to see you all enjoying yourselves!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> But I must warn you...even I cannot guarantee a happy result should you engage in fisticuffs here.</p><p><strong>Gang Members:</strong> Ghh...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Phew! Alcohol really is dangerous stuff, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Perhaps we should simply close the bar down. Or at least ban them from the premises.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Good thinking. In fact, I was just about to ask you to do that myself.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Even guys like that should be able to control themselves as long as they stay away from alcohol.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> So from now on, I&#39;d like you to limit the bar to myself, the different organizations&#39; leaders...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...and the men who will be showing up soon.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> You got it, boss.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Understood!</p><hr><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Good. I&#39;ll leave this in your capable hands then.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...So, this is really happening tomorrow.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I take it you are reluctant to part with it?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Of course I am.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> That relic has been passed down within my family in secret for a thousand years.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I never dreamed that I would ever let it go.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> But now that it&#39;s come out that it is in my possession, it could put the whole city at risk.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> So before word spreads too far, I plan to sell it to the highest bidder...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...and invest the money in helping this city prosper.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> That&#39;s quite magnanimous of you, sir.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I promise you my cohort and I will do everything in our power to help you see this through.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Thank you. I feel better knowing you&#39;re here. All right, see you later.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Phew, that was quite the little ordeal. ...Hm? Is something wrong, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What was that about a relic?</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> All will be clear tomorrow, you&#39;ll see. Now, what say we pick up our lecture from where we left off yesterday?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I trust you recall the three organizations&#39; different characteristics now?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> All three are different sizes.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> All three are in very different positions.</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Quite right!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Now then, let&#39;s assume each group pursues the best course of action for them to seize control of this city.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Group A, Diarmuid, would ideally like to team up with Izo to take out Yan Qing.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Once that&#39;s done, he could take his time folding Izo&#39;s small organization into his own.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> But that would not be to Izo&#39;s interests.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> While he may be able to get rid of Yan Qing that way, it would leave him helpless against Diarmuid.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> And that, of course, would all but assure his defeat. As such, Izo can never team up with Diarmuid.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> So then, you might think Izo could just team up with Yan Qing to take out Diarmuid, but there, too, you would be wrong.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> After all, they too are now an inextricable part of the city!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Then, what if Group A, Diarmuid, teams up with Group B, Yan Qing, to take out Group C, Izo, first?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Yes, such a team up would let them take out Izo easily, but also lead to its own rather messy set of problems.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Without enough people working the docks, the city&#39;s economy would all but grind to a halt.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> More than that, neither group truly NEEDS to team up with the other to take Izo down.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Both A and B would merely hope that their partner ends up bearing the lion&#39;s share of the losses in the battle to destroy C.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> In summary, there is no viable path forward for any group. Forming an alliance, going on the attack...neither of these are feasible options.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> It is quite the stalemate.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> And now, something new is being added to the mix.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I trust I don&#39;t need to explain what a Holy Grail War is to you, do I, Master?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...Phew. It&#39;s almost time...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Tomorrow, there&#39;s going to be a battle for control of this case. That&#39;s just the way it is.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> This is to help build a better future. I have to accept that there are going to be sacrifices.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> It won&#39;t be easy... But at this point, I see no alternative.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> We just aren&#39;t strong enough to keep this relic safe on our own anymore.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> Just keep cool for now. It all comes down to what happens next.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> We&#39;re the ones who&#39;ll be taking control of this city.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> We&#39;re not going to let these damned outsiders have so much as a scrap.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> As soon as the ritual is over, we&#39;re going to kill every last one of them...!</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> ...Hehaha.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> I can hear that stuck-up old man yapping away. So much for that chivalrous routine he likes to put on.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> If he&#39;s gonna shake his cane at us for being outsiders after we&#39;ve been here twenty years, we&#39;ll just spend two hundred years working our way in until we&#39;re a goddamn institution!</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> This city wants us to take it over. It&#39;s practically begging for us to liven the place up.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> It all comes down to tomorrow. If the others think they can mess with us, they&#39;ve got another thing coming!</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> We live by the sea, and we&#39;ll die by the sea.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> Long as we&#39;ve got this town by its lifeline, it doesn&#39;t matter how few of us there are. We&#39;re the strongest of them all.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> And once this battle is over...we&#39;ll be the biggest, too.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> If the losers refuse to get down on their knees and beg for mercy...</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> ...we&#39;ll just kill every last one of them!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Did you say a Holy Grail War!?</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Yes, but this will be something of a miniature version–a kind known as a Subspecies Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Three mages are scheduled to arrive here tomorrow.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> They will begin by making bids for the relic in question.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> It holds considerable power, you see...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...so of course, the mages taking part in this Holy Grail War all wish to secure it for themselves.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> But the real problem...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...is that each of the three warring gangs has backed a different mage.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> In other words, whoever wins this Subspecies Holy Grail War will also win control of the city.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yikes.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Yikes indeed.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Th-this is awful...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Uh, yes! Indeed it is!</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Suffice to say, our role here...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...is to keep them all in check so as to minimize damage to the city.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Or so I gather.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Okay, but how do we go about doing that?</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Good question.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> We can&#39;t count on backup from Chaldea, and you and I have limited options at best.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> But, I can tell from the expression on your face that we must find a way, no matter what.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Very well, but there is little we can do now. At this point, it all comes down to tomorrow.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> So tomorrow, let&#39;s begin by seeing what course of action each group chooses to pursue!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Morning!</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Good morning, Master.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Hehe, tell me, have you ever considered running a bar or a café once you&#39;ve retired from Mastering?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I bet you would enjoy it quite a bit if you partnered up with the young Ms. Kyrielight!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Running a bar with Mash...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Running a café with Mash...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Welcome. I&#39;ll be your bartender for tonight. My name is Mash Kyrielight.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> And as a bartender, I thought I should suit up for the occasion!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I can&#39;t drink alcohol myself, but I&#39;ll do my best with the cocktail shaking!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ei! Yah! Hrah!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So cute!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Welcome to Café Chaldea!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m Mash Kyrielight, your server for today. Please sit back and relax!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, right. I almost forgot.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Welcome back, Senpai...♡</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I like that...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Wh-what am I thinking? Mash would never say that.</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...All right, I think that&#39;s enough daydreaming. It would seem the mages have arrived.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I&#39;m surprised to see all three of them here so early. Perhaps they just couldn&#39;t wait any longer!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Me and Mash...</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Are you still woolgathering!? Come on! Snap out of it!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Good day, everyone. Welcome to my home.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Mm, nice location. I&#39;d love to requisition this place, land and all.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> ...I see you like to waste your time dwelling on trivialities, even when you&#39;re about to do battle.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Go ahead and think about whatever you like.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> In the end, such thoughts are mere delusions. In a few days, you can waste your time grieving for the treasure you failed to claim.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...Hmm.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> And here I thought we would be seeing Casters show up to represent these mages...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I suppose we can take this as a sign that each of these mages is really quite battle-hungry.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Allow me to welcome you all once again. I am honored to have you here in my home.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...But then, I guess there&#39;s no need to stand on ceremony, is there?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> You&#39;re all here for something I own. I&#39;m aware of that.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> You also know that multiple sources are ninety percent sure that it&#39;s the genuine article.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I expect, then, that you are all here to verify that last ten percent in person?</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Yeah, pretty much.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> None of us would be amused if we came all this way only to have it turn out to be counterfeit.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Agreed. I don&#39;t wish to sound demanding, but I would indeed like to see it for myself.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Naturally, I wouldn&#39;t dream of trying to kill the others at this time.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> And neither would you, Count Vlad, correct?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Of course not.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> No true mage would be so foolish as to throw away their honor here. That would be an act of beasts, not men.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> I would never do anything to disturb this peace while the item&#39;s owner shows us such hospitality.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Thank you. All right then, you may go and see it for yourselves.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> This is the relic that has been passed down in my family for generations.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> The linden leaf that stuck to the back of a heroic dragon slayer.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> It&#39;s... It&#39;s real! This is definitely the genuine article!</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> I may not have been a mage for very long, but I can still recognize the real thing when I see it!</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Indeed. I can tell it is indeed what our host claims with merely a single look at its magnificence!</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Now I have no doubt that with this in hand I would win this Subspecies Holy Grail War!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> ...I see.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> So, this relic can serve as a catalyst with which to summon a powerful Servant.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Given that most such artifacts, such as the snakeskin to summon the King of Heroes, and the Gordian Knot to summon the King of Conquerors, have fallen into the Association&#39;s hands...</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> ...this could well be the last of its kind in the entire world.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> For a relic like this, I would gladly take part in a Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...I&#39;m glad to see you all understand.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I must ask you all to pay richly for a chance to own this relic...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...but I think you will agree that it is well worth it.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> As I&#39;m sure you all know, this leaf is a powerful catalyst that can be used to summon the great hero Siegfried.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Using this catalyst, your chances of summoning anyone else are negligible.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> It cannot be divided among you, however, as its effectiveness as a catalyst would be greatly compromised by the damage such division would cause.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> So only one of you may claim this relic.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> But no one need be hurt to do so. That is certainly not what I want.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> That is why I will be holding the auction.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I have faith that you&#39;re all able and willing to pay what this relic is worth.</p><p><strong>Mages:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> (Very nice. Do you understand, Master?)</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> (All any of them care about is getting a jump on the others. Naturally, they&#39;re not afraid to get their hands dirty if it means gaining an edge.)</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> (Depending on how things go, there may not even be an auction at all.)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (Isn&#39;t that dangerous?)</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> (Absolutely.)</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> (Now then, how should we go about this...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (What should we do?)</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> (An excellent question.)</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> (None of these mages, nor the gangs backing them...)</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> (...can afford to let anyone else have this relic.)</p><hr><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> ... ...Only one of us, huh.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> I&#39;d love to resolve this peacefully if we could.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> As would I. But, that is easier said than done.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Isn&#39;t that right, Count Vlad?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Izo.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> What?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> I need your entire fortune. That relic there is worth every penny of it.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> A-are you nuts!? You want my entire fortune...</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> ...just to buy a damn leaf!?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Silence.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> I don&#39;t mind letting you pretend to run the show in public.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> But if I fail to acquire that leaf, you will spend the rest of your life paying me back.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> Ghh...!</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> ...Hmm.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> (Looks like I&#39;ve got a real shot at this.)</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> (So in the end it all comes down to money...)</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> (Well, these are small-timers. They&#39;ll have to scrounge up every penny they can just to have a chance.)</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> (Normally, a catalyst of this quality would be forever beyond our reach. Only those ranked Pride or higher would even get to see it.)</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> (But since the only other mages here have loose ties to the Association, that opens up a wealth of options...)</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I&#39;ll be holding the auction tomorrow.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> The only ones who will be allowed to bid are Alexander, Prince of Lan Ling, and Vlad III.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> No exceptions.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Even if any other mages should catch wind of this auction, and enter a bid higher than one of yours...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...we have no plans to alter the arrangement.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> (Perfect!)</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> All right, that&#39;s all for today. Please feel free to relax and enjoy yourselves until tomorrow.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Of course, you are also free to take this time to put together as much money as you can, if you wish.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...Phew.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Mr. Moriarty and...Fujimaru was it?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Tomorrow is when your work really begins. I&#39;m counting on you.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Understood.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Great. Okay, see you later.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Well, we certainly have our work cut out for us, but for now, why don&#39;t we focus on the task at hand?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Wyvern control?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> You got it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Komodo dragon control?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> It&#39;s supposed to be wyvern control, but never mind that now!</p><hr><h2 id="section-3-my-fleeting-fate" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3-my-fleeting-fate" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 3: My Fleeting Fate!</h2><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> They say good wine makes good blood, but it can also be just as good at making bad blood.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> How many times have we heard of someone committing an egregious breach of etiquette while under the influence?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I&#39;ve heard mages have a way of neutralizing alcohol&#39;s effects...but I expect that only applies to the dangers of extreme overconsumption.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Once they are intoxicated, they are surely just as likely to loosen their lips as anyone else...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...especially when speaking to ordinary bartenders like us.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> So, why don&#39;t we start by bringing Alexander in here and seeing what we can learn from him?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...Though I would like to ask that you do the talking, if you don&#39;t mind.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I&#39;ll stick to the occasional interjection.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Why&#39;s that?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Well, my young friend, once you reach a certain age, it becomes extremely difficult not to always appear shady, particularly in younger company...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;ll give it a shot!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Okeydokey!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...Sorry. Spur of the moment.</p><hr><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Alcohol?</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> I&#39;m not sure I understand. You want me to have a drink now, under these circumstances?</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> ...Well, okay. They have a saying for this in China: “You can&#39;t catch a tiger cub without going into a tiger&#39;s den.”</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> In other words, nothing ventured, nothing gained. Those other two have been mages a lot longer than me.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> So if I want to get ahead, I&#39;ve just got to leap in without fear.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Besides, I&#39;m sure you two have some useful info of your own.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Here you go.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> (No sign of magical energy, let alone poison. But, I guess that&#39;s to be expected.)</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> So, what do you call this?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> That is a dry martini, the king of cocktails.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Seeing how you have an air of royalty about you, I thought it would be fitting.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Huh, never heard of it.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> (That&#39;s because it has yet to be invented.)</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Hey, that&#39;s pretty good...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s okay for you to drink, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> You&#39;re saying I look underage?</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m not. I&#39;m just doing what I can to keep the ravages of time at bay.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Though of course, I don&#39;t expect any other mages would take it easy on me just &#39;cause I look like a kid.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Do you think you&#39;ve got a good shot at the auction?</p><hr><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> That&#39;s what I came here to find out. Can I get another of these?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> (Use the information I gave you earlier, Master.)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Well, Yan Qing&#39;s organization is...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Well, Izo&#39;s organization is...</p><hr><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> ...Now I see. So all three groups are dancing on a razor&#39;s edge.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Well damn, now what do I do.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> I originally contacted Diarmuid&#39;s group because I heard they were the biggest player here...</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> ...but if they&#39;re that closely tied to the city, that&#39;s really gonna hold me back.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Not to mention that between the three of us mages, my family&#39;s got the shortest history.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Does that mean you&#39;re the weakest?</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> You don&#39;t mince words, do you!</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> But, you&#39;re not wrong.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Is there a problem with that?</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Mages are all about passing power down through generations. My family&#39;s only been at it for three hundred years.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> But those two have families that go back five hundred and seven hundred years.</p><hr><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> ...That said, my magecraft is pretty well-suited to combat, so that could tip the scales in my favor.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Well-suited to combat!</p><hr><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Yup. You know about centaurs, right?</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> The legendary half-human, half-horse creatures?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yeah, sure do!</p><hr><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> I&#39;m sure they were incredibly fast, but that&#39;s not the only reason they were so strong.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> No, they were strong because they focused all of their attention on pinpoint precision with their arrows, even while running at those incredible speeds.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Concentration is key. Not just in magecraft, but in everything.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> If people could concentrate like a centaur, it would improve their abilities tenfold across the board.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Even if you don&#39;t have a lot of magical energy to work with, if you focus, you could squeeze every last drop you have right into your magical circuits.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You mean, like an energy-efficient battery?</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> “Battery”?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Think of it as a kind of energy engine.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> So, you use your body so efficiently that you&#39;re able to boost not just combat abilities, but all abilities.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Quite the superhuman training regimen.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about, but it sounds impressive.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Ahaha, don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll see soon enough.</p><hr><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Anyway, you&#39;re going to pump the other mages for information too, right?</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> I sure would appreciate it if you let me in on what you learn, too!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> A mage who tries his hardest to compensate for being the weakest, hm. That&#39;s an admirable attitude with which to go into battle...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...but it would seem to make him something of a poor ally for Diarmuid.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> How so?</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Left to his own devices, Alexander would surely do whatever it takes to win...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...but Diarmuid is more concerned with playing by the rules and winning fairly and honorably.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> It may not be an issue in the beginning, but by the end, the disparity in their methods could very well spell their doom.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Now then, why don&#39;t we see what Prince of Lan Ling has to say!</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Alcohol, huh.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> ...I see nothing to fear.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> I would have no trouble breaking alcohol down with one hand tied behind my back, after all.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> I am happy to drink this if it will help me acquire information.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Coming right up, sir.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Here&#39;s your cocktail. This is called a silver bullet.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Silver bullet?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Indeed. That is what you use when slaying monsters, is it not?</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Hmm. So it&#39;s a good luck charm, is it?</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> ...Well, I suppose I&#39;ll need all the help I can get. Alexander I can handle, but Vlad is a formidable opponent.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What if you and Alexander teamed up?</p><hr><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> ...That&#39;s a good idea.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> And I&#39;m sure Alexander would also prefer to go up against me rather than Vlad.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> But I don&#39;t think Yan Qing would go for that... Then again, I suppose if I want to know, I&#39;ll have to ask.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> And he does need to understand that Vlad III is our greatest threat...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What&#39;s Count Vlad like as a mage?</p><hr><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Well, the rumor is that he uses blood as a catalyst for his magecraft.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Whether that&#39;s true or not, I do know that both his magical crest and his magical circuits are stellar.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> His magecraft may not be focused on combat, but I doubt he will have any trouble keeping up.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> As for Alexander... Oho, imitating the centaurs, huh?</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> If that&#39;s true, it would seem to have very narrow applications, but I suppose it would also be rather difficult to predict.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Thank you for the drink. It was delicious. I think I will go see if Alexander would be amenable to working together.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Hm? What is my magecraft like? Hehe, how silly to think I would tell you that.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> The very basis of magecraft is secrecy. That is as true today as it was in ancient times.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> That said, it would not be difficult to figure out if you examined my magical lineage.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> I hope tomorrow&#39;s auction goes smoothly... for all our sakes.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> All right, that just leaves Count Vlad...though who knows if he&#39;ll actually come.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> I have come.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> You have!?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> How in the world did you convince him?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> It&#39;s simple, bartender.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Your pupil there was unfailingly polite when [♂ he /♀ she] expressed [♂ his /♀ her] wish to entertain me.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> It was clear that [♂ he /♀ she] meant every word, and I intuited no signs of malice whatsoever.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> And so it is only proper that I accept [♂ his /♀ her] invitation, lest it reflect poorly on me as a mage.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Now, come and celebrate my victory, bartender.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...Very well. May I suggest a Bloody Mary?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> You may. I know nothing of alcohol and its intricacies in any case.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> I see. So that bastard Prince of Lan Ling told you about my magecraft, did he?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Even if he did avoid going into detail, I can&#39;t say I enjoy having someone else share my secrets.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Not to mention it seems a tad unfair that he insists on keeping his own magecraft a secret.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> So go ahead and tell Alexander this:</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Prince of Lan Ling&#39;s magecraft is based on beauty. He uses curses to entrance his targets and bring about their downfall.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> However, while that may work on ordinary men, it will have no effect on me.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> If anything, it is Alexander who may hope to stand against me.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> All that remains is to see how much money Izo is able and willing to pony up. But these men are no fools.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> They are willing to make great sacrifices if it means gaining control of this city.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> ...Hmm. I still don&#39;t know much about alcohol, but I do like this brilliant red color.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Once I&#39;ve obtained the catalyst for myself, I think I&#39;ll celebrate with another of these Bloody Marys.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...Well, he was certainly the most imposing, wasn&#39;t he? Though he also seems not so much guarded as...oblivious?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yeah, I&#39;ll go with oblivious.</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> All right, now that we&#39;ve got more information to work with, let&#39;s see if we can&#39;t make some sense of it.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> First of all, while these mages share a name, body, and personality with the Servants they appear to be...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...they are not actually those Servants. I trust you already understand that?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> The Vlad III we spoke to may sound like the same one we know...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...but in reality, he may speak completely differently. Even boorishly.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> For that matter, Prince of Lan Ling may not even be from China.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> But we perceive them as the Servants we know, and thus hear their words in a way matching that perception.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> The same thing happens whenever we speak to them. Before our words can reach their brains, they are processed to fall in line with their perceptions.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> That is why we can address an ordinary mage as Vlad III without causing any problems.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> This is getting confusing...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I don&#39;t know how I&#39;m gonna keep this all straight...</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> If you think that&#39;s confusing, wait till you hear this next part!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Since each of the three gangs are working with one of the mages, you might think there are only three factions at play here...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...but in actuality, there are six!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Each faction is trying to obtain power and treasure to realize their own ambitions.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> And we–</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Are gonna swoop in at the end and take it all for ourselves?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> My, you are just a cunning devil after my own heart, Master. But no.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Are gonna make sure none of them succeed?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Exactly!</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> As for our exact plan of action, I think that can wait until tomorrow.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> If I&#39;ve read the situation correctly, something will happen at the auction.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> For the time being we had best take the opportunity to rest while we can to prepare for tomorrow!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Well, good night.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...I can&#39;t sleep...</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Oh, up already? It&#39;s not even daybreak yet.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I just couldn&#39;t seem to fall asleep...</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I see. Hmm. In that case...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...perhaps it would help if I told you a story from my own admittedly checkered past?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;d love to hear any story you&#39;re willing to tell!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (This feels a little weird, but) sure!</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Heh.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> In truth, much of my life was actually quite dull.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> What&#39;s that? Is it because I&#39;m a fictional character? I&#39;m not so sure.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> AM I a fictional character?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Or did James Moriarty truly exist at some point?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Did the events that make up my past truly happen?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...At this point, that is really not so important a distinction as you might think.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> All that really matters is that I&#39;m here now.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...My childhood memories are all rather hazy.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> There is only one thing that I remember from them: equations.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I remember their cleanliness. The beauty inherent in their structure. How gentle they could be...and how terrifying.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> It is thanks to equations that one can determine precisely where a ball will land once thrown.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...I think, back when I was just a boy, I would often ponder why no one else seemed to realize their appeal.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Once I had reached what most would consider an adult age, I wrote a book:</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> “The Dynamics of an Asteroid”...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> But it never saw the light of day, thanks to the mathematicians who saw it buried before it took off.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> But honestly, I can&#39;t say I was surprised.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I knew all too well how petty and guarded people could be.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> All the more so once they realized the terrifying implications of my book.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Still, despite my lack of surprise, I was at a loss as to how to respond. How, then, was I to verify the equation therein?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I remember cocking my head and thinking to myself, “Now what am I going to do?”</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I didn&#39;t want to go my whole life without ever knowing if that equation was correct or not.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> This may make me sound like a petulant child...but I simply did not like that idea. Not one bit.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I was sure I could prove my equation was correct. I HAD to prove it was correct.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> So I decided to turn to evil.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Why?</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Hmm, I suppose I cannot possibly expect you to understand that part, no.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I wanted to prove beyond all doubt how beautiful and terrifying my equation was.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> So I swore I would do whatever I must to make that happen, and eliminate anyone who stood in my way.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> From there, I devoted myself solely to calculating one thing:</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> How could I go about proving this equation to the world at large?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> And the conclusion I reached was that I must turn to evil.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> As an evil man, I would use this equation to wreak destruction upon the world.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> My next step was to form an organization.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I mixed intricate schemes into evil that typically tended toward straightforward simplicity.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I provided wisdom and intelligence to evil that typically resorted to brute strength and violence.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I piled up evil deeds upon evil deeds, until one day...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...that accursed detective brought me to justice.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What did you expect?</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...A fair point!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> From my perspective, I thought I was just advising everyone to take notice of me.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> But once they started calling me “genius,” “scum,” “morally bankrupt,” “monster,” and “the Napoleon of crime”...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...well, I suppose I let all of that go to my head.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> But regardless, Fujimaru, even with all that said...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...I don&#39;t regret my decision to turn to a life of evil.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> There is one–no, two reasons for that.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I enjoyed myself immensely. Yes, I admit it: I truly AM morally bankrupt.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> But in spite of that, or perhaps because of it, I can say without a doubt that few have enjoyed their lives so thoroughly as I enjoyed mine.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> It was grand fun to see people playing into my hands, and even more fun to see them falling into my traps.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Watching them stumble off a cliff, or trip on a pebble, or have a vase come crashing down on them, were some of the greatest moments of hilarity I ever witnessed!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Talk about Chaotic-Evil...!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Indeed.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That doesn&#39;t sound fun to me at all.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...I&#39;m impressed you can look me right in the eye when you say that.</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Of course, it isn&#39;t as though I was riding high for the rest of my life.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I met my end tumbling down the Reichenbach Falls.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> It was a miserable end, but properly befitting a criminal like myself. And to make matters worse, the man I tried to drag down with me ended up surviving.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I remember how ashy gray the sky was that day, at a time that was neither morning nor evening. How the icy cold waters seemed to scream like machine-gun fire.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> It&#39;s quite strange, really. Why in the world did I challenge him to a fistfight?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> If I am merely fictional, then I&#39;m sure I did so purely to satisfy the demands of the plot. But if I did actually exist, then I think I understand.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...I must have wanted to show him what a villain like me is truly made of.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> All right, back to bed with you! Surely you must be bored enough now to drift right off.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Wait. What about the other reason?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What&#39;s the second reason you don&#39;t regret your choice?</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Oh come now, do I really have to spell it out?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Because if it wasn&#39;t for my life of crime, I would never have gotten to meet you!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Hahaha, now, now, don&#39;t be bashful. Even aged gentlemen like me are, at times, prone to sentiment.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> All right, that&#39;s quite enough. Off to bed with you! Good night!</p><h2 id="section-4-triangle-magus" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4-triangle-magus" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 4: Triangle Magus</h2><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Time for the auction, huh...</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> All right, let&#39;s see what happens toda–</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> C-come quick!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> The relic&#39;s been stolen!!!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> D-did you say stolen!?</p><p><strong>All:</strong> ... ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (It&#39;s scary, seeing them all on edge like this.)</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> (Not one word.

As we&#39;d be caught in the cross fire, I&#39;d rather not see that happen.)</p><hr><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...As you can see...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...the linden leaf, the perfect catalyst with which to summon Siegfried the Dragon Slayer, has been stolen.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> ...What sort of security measures did you have in place?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> As I demonstrated to all six of you yesterday, I didn&#39;t leave it anywhere that an ordinary thief could have taken it.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> True. But that wouldn&#39;t be much help if the thief was a skilled mage.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> ...Oho. I&#39;m surprised to hear you so willingly giving voice to your own ineptitude.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> That aside, I can say from what I saw yesterday that the catalyst&#39;s defenses focused on alerts.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> What&#39;s that mean?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> It means that we should have heard an alarm blaring throughout the mansion, no matter how it was stolen.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> That security spell has been passed down in my family for generations.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> But I am not a mage, so I have no real idea of how it works.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> You two. As mages yourselves, surely you understand.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Magecraft may be capable of anything, but it is far from perfect.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> To steal the catalyst without setting off the alarm...</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> ...would require two skilled mages working together.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Even I could not do this alone.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> So what, you&#39;re saying the two of us are in cahoots?</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> If you ask me, I think it&#39;s way more likely that the owner faked this theft so he could keep his heirloom for himself.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...I can only say that I would never do such a thing.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I have no reason to want to keep it for myself. It&#39;s nothing but a burden for me.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> As it plays such a valuable part in Holy Grail Wars, there are no end of people who have designs on it.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Trust me, I have no irrational attachment to it just because it happens to be a family heirloom.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Well then...who DID steal it?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> ...Now what do we do?

I mean, you and Sieg go way back, right?</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> It makes perfect sense for you to cut a deal ahead of time.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> ...How dare you!?</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> Yeah, yeah, act offended all you want. Doesn&#39;t change the fact that you&#39;re still the most likely suspect.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> ...Well, well.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> I knew not to expect much in the way of manners from a man of the sea...</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> ...but if you&#39;re willing to goad us into a fight, you have more guts than I thought.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> ...Just so we&#39;re clear, I didn&#39;t steal it.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> If anything, I had a better chance in the auction.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> It wouldn&#39;t make sense for me to go to the trouble of stealing it.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> I did not steal it either. If anyone here would have a motive to steal it...</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> ...wouldn&#39;t that be the skilled mage with the least money to spend?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> ...Oh?</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Makes sense to me.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Your family might have a long history, but they haven&#39;t done well keeping up with the times.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> The whole reason you&#39;re taking part in this Subspecies Holy Grail War is because you need money, right?</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Prince of Lan Ling and I both have money to spare, so there&#39;s no reason for either of us to assume the risks involved with stealing it.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> That sounds like a challenge to me.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Wait!

Once we know that, we should be able to resolve this.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;ll do my best.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Thank you...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What do you think, Moriarty?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...That&#39;s fine with me, of course.</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> However, we have one condition.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> What is it...?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> It&#39;s simple.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> We can&#39;t leave ourselves open to accusations of bribery, or this will all be for naught.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> So I would like a mage from an opposing faction to be present during our questioning.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> For example, when we speak to Alexander, I would request that either Count Vlad or Prince of Lan Ling be present.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Though of course, I will also insist that they refrain from comment during the proceedings.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> That sounds safe and reasonable. I trust all of you are okay with that?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> ...Fine with me.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Then I shall go first. One of you, come with me.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> ...All right, I&#39;ll go.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> The thief is almost certainly Prince of Lan Ling.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> How can you be so sure?</p><hr><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> I know that I did not steal it.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> And Alexander has the least reason to steal it himself. Thus, by the process of elimination, it must be Prince of Lan Ling.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> He is the only mage here whose power is ill-suited to fighting a Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> And if he wished to resell it, he would not want to waste his own money in an auction.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Hmm.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Furthermore, Prince of Lan Ling&#39;s magecraft is particularly well-suited to thievery.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> He could have easily used his beauty to manipulate others into doing his bidding–</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> But let us not forget, Count Vlad, that you have just as much of a motive as he does.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> They did say you&#39;ve been having some financial difficulties...</p><hr><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> ...That is true. But, I was also quite confident in my chances at victory.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> I would never resort to petty larceny to acquire what I desire.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> And so I believe the guilty party is Prince of Lan Ling, and ask that you proceed accordingly.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> That is all I have to say.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Hmm. So Count Vlad will be keeping an eye on me, huh.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> ...I think it was Alexander, though.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Why&#39;s that?</p><hr><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> From where I stand, he is the most suspicious of those present, by far.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Yes, on the surface, it may seem like he has the least motive. He is certainly the richest of us, thanks to his dealings with legitimate businesses.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> But if you consider it from a different angle, wealth is all he has.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> He has no connections to the Mage&#39;s Association, so taking part in this Subspecies Holy Grail War is the only hope he has to advance.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> If he failed to win the auction, he would have nothing left at all.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Hm?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I&#39;m not sure I follow. How would losing the auction leave him off any worse than before, then?</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> You mean you didn&#39;t know?</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> We each had to pay an enormous fee just for the opportunity to bid.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> And we don&#39;t get it back if we lose.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> So if, by some chance, he did end up losing the auction, he would then be no more than a penniless third-rate mage.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Whereas Count Vlad and I both have our legacies to fall back on.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Seems to me that the ability, or lack thereof, to pick one&#39;s self up again after a setback would be a substantial motive. Don&#39;t you agree?</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Hmm. Whatever the others might say, I know I didn&#39;t take it.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> So I can only guess it was Count Vlad.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> I&#39;m pretty sure Prince of Lan Ling has enough money to go toe to toe with me in an auction, after all.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> ...Of course, if push came to shove, he could have always resorted to trying to take it by force...</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> ...but if that was his plan, he could have just waited until after the auction was over.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> So yeah, I think I have to go with Count Vlad here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m pretty sure the Count has thought up some kind of plan...</p><hr><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> I&#39;m sure he was just bluffing.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> He might be a talented mage, but it still would&#39;ve been risky for him to come under the spotlight there.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Not to mention Izo&#39;s gang doesn&#39;t seem like they&#39;d be much help.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Oh, hey, I just remembered we had a deal, didn&#39;t we? Did you find out anything useful?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Prince of Lan Ling uses, uh...</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> I don&#39;t mind you sharing what you know.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Information that basic will come to light soon enough anyway.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Hmm. Magecraft that charms targets with beauty, huh...</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> I&#39;m sure it has its uses, but he&#39;d be the first to die in a Holy Grail War unless he had a powerful Servant.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> ...Hmph.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Count Vlad uses...</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Blood magecraft?</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> ...Blood is definitely an important catalyst for magecraft.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> And if his family&#39;s been developing it for hundreds of years...</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> ...it could be something miraculous, combat-oriented or not.</p><hr><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> But anyway, figuring out which of them stole it isn&#39;t automatically going to bring it back.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Wait, hang on. I just had a thought.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Maybe someone in one of this city&#39;s gangs got greedy.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> That relic is damn near priceless, after all.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Somebody might&#39;ve gotten in touch with another mage to try and sell it for an even higher price.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Anyway, that&#39;s all I&#39;ve got to say.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...Care for a drink?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> For you, we&#39;ve got water and dihydrogen monoxide. Which would you prefer?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s just water!</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Hahaha, you know I can&#39;t go letting you have alcohol. Anyway, I&#39;d say we&#39;ve learned some rather interesting tidbits so far.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Every one of them insisted they had not committed the theft.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> And they all named someone different for the culprit.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Money, skill in magecraft, timing...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> All three of them enjoy success in one area, but none of them have it all.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So, now what do we do?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Then how are we supposed to tell who did it?</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> A good question, to be sure.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Each of them is suspicious, each had motive, and certainly each had opportunity.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> And on top of all that, not a one of them has an alibi.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> A wonderfully convenient state of affairs for whoever is behind this, wouldn&#39;t you agree?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What do you mean by that...?</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Oh come now, don&#39;t tell me you&#39;ve forgotten?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> This all took place in the past, so I happen to know what occurs next.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> With each side&#39;s agent suspecting the other, the three gangs will wage a battle so fierce that it envelops the entire city, resulting in tremendous loss of life.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> At least that is the outcome as I heard it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Now that you mention it...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> But, we still have to stop that from happening, don&#39;t we?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Sorry, I forgot.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Well, I can&#39;t blame you for that. I almost forgot, too.</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...Now then.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Given what we already know and just learned, I did some digging of my own.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Eavesdropping on the various gang members&#39; conversations, stealing a glance at their ledgers... That sort of thing.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> And as it turns out...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Well, I know a lot more now than I did before, but–</p><hr><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> Oh, if it isn&#39;t the apprentice bartender.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Good evening.</p><hr><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> You shouldn&#39;t be wandering around so late at night, not with this mansion&#39;s security being so lax.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (It&#39;s kind of refreshing, hearing him talk like this...)</p><hr><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> I was born in this city, you know. I plan to die here as well.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> That may not mean much to you since you&#39;re not from here, but for me, there could be no better end.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> But with each year that passes, that seems less and less likely.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> Between all these telegrams and now ships circling the globe, the world just keeps getting smaller.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> And while I&#39;ve never seen one myself, they say they even have ships that can fly nowadays.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> Ships have allowed this city to flourish, and now, everyone wants a share of the profit for themselves.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> I just hoped to prevent that desire for profit from breaking out into a war.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Are you thinking about retiring?</p><hr><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> How did you know that?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> ...Yes, I am. I think I have been in this game as long as I can stand.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> Anyway, I&#39;d better be on my way. This wind is absolutely freezing.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> ...Tch, so the geezer&#39;s finally acting his age.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> You hear that, apprentice? The old man wants to retire, huh?</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> What a joke. Once he retires, that&#39;ll be it. This city&#39;ll become one big battleground.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> Me and Yan Qing&#39;ll be fighting each other tooth and nail for control of the place.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> And in the end, some outsider&#39;ll just come waltzing in and take it all for themselves.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> ...This city&#39;s only going to get bigger and bigger. We can&#39;t go closing it off to the outside world.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> I can&#39;t blame Yan Qing&#39;s gang for going wild sometimes.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> Frankly, people have even started complaining about them to me.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> They say they see them being rowdy at restaurants, or getting drunk, and all kinds of petty stuff like that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Are you sure you don&#39;t want to reconcile with him?</p><hr><p><strong>Izo:</strong> Believe me, I wish it were that simple.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> People in our business don&#39;t take the peaceful approach seriously. That&#39;s just the way of the world.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> ...By the way, that bartender friend of yours is pretty strong, isn&#39;t he?</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> From the looks of it, I&#39;d say he&#39;s... Nah, never mind.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> You don&#39;t seem the bloody sort. Nothing wrong with that.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> (Sigh)... If only the world was a little simpler...</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Oh hey, it&#39;s the apprentice kid. You figure out who the thief is?</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> ...On second thought, don&#39;t tell me. I think it&#39;d only complicate things if I found out now.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> I saw Izo grumbling. Did something happen?</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Sounds like he&#39;s got it rough.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> And of course, his men are all brutes. He&#39;s the only one in that gang who actually thinks before he acts.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Still, I know what he means when he says he wishes the world were simpler.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> It&#39;s been twenty years since me and my crew wound up in this city, but they still refuse to accept us.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> It&#39;s hard not to get a bit depressed when you can&#39;t even go out for a meal and not have it be a big deal for people to bitch about.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> So I decided to bring everyone together...</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> ...to make the city admit they needed us.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> But now, we&#39;ve got mages involved, and we&#39;re all fighting for control of some weird relic.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> ...I don&#39;t even know what to make of it. Life is freakin&#39; bizarre, and there&#39;s no knowing what&#39;s what you know?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Sounds like you&#39;ve got it rough, too...</p><hr><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Some things, you just have to suffer for. At least, that&#39;s what I want to think.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Though honestly, I&#39;d rather be living on easy street. I mean, who wouldn&#39;t?</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> So don&#39;t go making the same mistake I did, kid. Make sure you choose a fun life, not a hard one.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to do...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Easier said than done...</p><hr><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Hahaha, tell you what. If you ever decide to settle down in this city, that&#39;s when I&#39;ll listen to your sob story.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> But anyway, I probably shouldn&#39;t be seen talking with you for too long.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> So, see you tomorrow.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Good night.</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I can&#39;t say I approve of you going off on these nighttime walks without a Servant.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> But then, there are guards from all three gangs keeping an eye on things.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I suppose the odds of something dangerous happening are–</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Well now, how is THAT for timing!?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> But what could they possibly be thinking, going after us?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I&#39;m not sure whether they&#39;re out to make a show of their incompetence or to actually take out their rivals.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> In the end, it won&#39;t matter if they manage to take us out or not.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Just the fact that they tried is an egregious violation of trust!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> As for why they would go to such deplorable lengths...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Ah, but I&#39;m getting ahead of myself. Once again, now is not the time!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Come on, we need to fight!</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Right you are.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> That they all have firearms trained on us would seem to be a clear expression of hostile intent.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> So I have no compunction against crushing this lot.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Oh, and by the way, this may come as a surprise to you, but I am QUITE potent in a fight!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> All right then, let&#39;s show these goons what for, my young bartender Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> What&#39;s all the commotion?</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> I thought I heard gunshots...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Oh, don&#39;t worry, everything&#39;s under control! Just a slight misunderstanding!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I assure you we&#39;re quite all right. Now go on, get out of here!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Listen to me.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> If you three get mixed up in this now, it will only make the situation worse!</p><p><strong>All Three:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> ...All right. Yan Qing, Izo, I trust you&#39;re both okay with that, too?</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> ...Fine by me.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> I&#39;m going to bed. I&#39;ve had enough of this shit for one day.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...There we go.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I don&#39;t think we would have gained any pertinent information from questioning them anyway.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Now then, tell me, Master: Who do you think sent those thugs after us?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Diarmuid? Yan Qing? Izo? Alexander? Prince of Lan Ling? Vlad III?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Every one of them is a viable suspect. They all have motive, opportunity, and the money with which to hire the thugs we&#39;ve just dispatched.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> However...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Just because they had motive, opportunity, and money to send people after us, does it necessarily follow that they did so?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> What do you think?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I don&#39;t think any of them are the type to go after someone like me.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Yes, exactly! The rules for these kind of skirmishes don&#39;t apply to you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> They&#39;re not exactly good people, but...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> That&#39;s true. They are most certainly not good people.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> But, neither are they so evil that they would readily order the murder of an innocent young [♂ man /♀ lady].</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> They are, of course, citizens of the underworld and mages, respectively.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Were it truly necessary to achieve their goals, I have no doubt they would kill us.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> But by that same token, they would not go out of their way to kill us when there is no pressing need to do so.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Anyway, tonight is the final night, making tomorrow the final morning.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> The morning when everyone shall draw the losing straw, and lose something precious to them.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> All right, Master, let&#39;s bring this case to a neat, tidy close!</p><h2 id="section-5-old-spider" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-5-old-spider" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 5: Old Spider</h2><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> All right, Mr. Moriarty, tell us what you found out.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Very well. May I have everyone&#39;s attention, please?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> As you know, a priceless relic was stolen from this estate.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Yesterday, my apprentice and I talked to all of you on behalf of our employer, Mr. Sieg, to make sure nothing had been overlooked.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> To leap ahead somewhat and begin with the conclusion, each of you has your own reasons for being a perfectly viable suspect.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Mr. Diarmuid is on the brink of retirement. Mr. Yan Qing is worried about his subordinates&#39; future.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Mr. Izo is concerned with how the growing marine transport industry will encroach on his business.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> But the one thing you all have in common...is that none of you can throw caution to the wind.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Should one of you step out of line, the others will devour you. So, you wait.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Then one day, Mr. Sieg shows up offering to let you bid on an invaluable relic. No doubt the news nearly gave you heart palpitations.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Surely, this would be the chance you have been waiting for; a chance for something to change. Am I correct so far?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> ...I&#39;d say so. Yan Qing and Izo probably already realized this, but yes, I have been thinking of retiring.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> Though of course, I would never do so while leaving my work unfinished.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> And that brings us to my first point.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> You wish to break this stalemate, so you mean to acquire the relic.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> This is, however, far from the true equation.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> While the three mages see it as their ticket to a surefire victory, and each wishes to get his hands on it no matter the cost...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...the three gang leaders don&#39;t care who gets it, for the stalemate will be broken regardless.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Thus, none of them have any motive to steal it. In fact, they have a clear motive NOT to.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> ...Okay, since it sounds like you&#39;ve taken me off the suspect list, I&#39;m just gonna ask: What is this motive?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Tell me, what would you think if one organization suddenly came into a great deal of money under these circumstances?</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Well, I&#39;d probably suspect they stole the relic and sold it.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> ...Ah. Got it.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> There you are. In essence, as long as the current state of affairs continues...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...none of you are free to move any large sums around, whether from selling the relic or anything else.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I imagine that would be quite a serious problem for an organization, no? Especially yours, Mr. Izo.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> ...Well, I wasn&#39;t planning on keeping this secret, but I am expecting a nice bit of cash in the near future.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> If I stole that relic, you&#39;d all only have more reason to suspect me.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Precisely. All of this is to say that the three gang leaders each have their own reasons for wanting the auction to go ahead.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Even if Mr. Diarmuid had lost, it would give him a perfect excuse to retire, to gracefully bow out.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> After all, Mr. Yan Qing&#39;s goal was only ever to ensure his subordinates would be accepted by this city.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> But if either party had stolen the relic, that would cause problems that no amount of money could resolve.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> As for Mr. Izo&#39;s reasons, well, we just went over those mere moments ago.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> We would seem to be left with one of the mages, but this is just as implausible.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Why is that?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Because the auction&#39;s results were far from a foregone conclusion.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Exactly!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> If one of them were to engage in foul play, he would still need to wait for the auction&#39;s results first.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Because nobody knows for sure how this is all going to unfold.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Indeed. After all, nobody here could be certain that they would get to keep the relic for themselves!</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Between his and Mr. Diarmuid&#39;s funds, Mr. Alexander was quite confident in his chances at winning the auction.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Prince of Lan Ling was less sure in his bidding prospects, but he also believed he had a chance at charming the relic off of whoever did win.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> As for Count Vlad, if he ended up losing the auction, he had every intention of seizing the relic by force.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Of course. Any true mage must be willing to get his hands dirty when necessary.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> But, that willingness to use violence does not come at the expense of my good sense.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> And employing that sense suggests there is nothing to be gained in stealing the relic. As such, I would never do so.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> Hold on. How is seizing the relic any different from stealing it?</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Stealing is an act of thievery. Seizing it by force is simply a noble doing what he must.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> That is the crucial difference.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> There you have it.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Every one of our guests, be they mage or gang member, had their honor on the line.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> But the culprit feared letting the relic go more than he did its theft.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> If he were to let it get away from him even once, everything his family had passed down for generations would be lost.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> That would remain the case even if he managed to steal it back later.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Thus, the relic leaving his possession was the one thing the culprit simply couldn&#39;t bear.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Isn&#39;t that right, Sieg?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Well, Sieg?</p><hr><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...Yeah, that&#39;s true.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I&#39;m the only one here with something I need to protect, even if it means reducing myself to thievery.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> The relic my family has kept safe for generations had been...tainted by the Subspecies Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> It became a catalyst meant for summoning Siegfried.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> ...Isn&#39;t that a great honor?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> My family respects the true Siegfried. We have no interest in a pale imitation.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> Then, you planned this whole thing!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Yes. This was my intention right from the start.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I had hoped your suspicions of one another would be strong enough to prompt you to wipe each other out.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> There was plenty of fuel for that fire, after all.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Though my...criminal consultant did warn me not to take matters that far.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You don&#39;t say...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> A criminal consultant, huh...</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> (Whistling innocently)</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Once the mages and the leaders of all three gangs were dead...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...the gang members would rampage about, killing anyone who even looked like a potential rival.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> At that point, nobody would stop to wonder where I went, and it would be all but impossible for anyone to track down the linden leaf.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> (Psst, Izo.)</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> (Right.)</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> ... ...!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> And there&#39;s one more thing I was lying about. I&#39;m a mage, too.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> What just happened...!?</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Izo!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> Dammit, he jumped out the window! After him!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> What? Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re giving up already?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I&#39;m not. I just didn&#39;t want to wreck my home with my magecraft.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I have quite the collection of precious artifacts and books inside. You understand.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> You and I have been good friends for a long time...</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> But no more. Fire!</p><p><strong>Gang Member:</strong> Die!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Sorry, but guns won&#39;t work on me.</p><p><strong>Gang Member:</strong> Gaaah!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> Tch... Fine then, close combat it is–</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Get a hold of yourself, Diarmuid! He&#39;s a mage!</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> If bullets didn&#39;t faze him, what good do you think swords will do!?</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> Yan Qing&#39;s right! Calm down!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> Ghh... I can&#39;t believe he had us all fooled this whole time!</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Stand back! We&#39;ll handle this!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Very well then, the winner of this battle shall claim the relic. Are we agreed?</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> You sneaky bastard! All right, then!</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Fine with me!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> (Just as I planned!)</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Step aside, my good gang leaders!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> All right, Master. I trust you know what to do?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Of course.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Ready your weapon, Archer.</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Very good! Let&#39;s get the opening battle of this Subspecies Holy Grail War started!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Dammit... I had countermeasures ready for the three mages...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> But I never expected you to join in the fray, Moriarty...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Back when I was alive, or perhaps in one of my secret made-up stories–not that the distinction is an important one anyway...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...the aftermath of this incident always left something of a foul taste in my mouth.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> No, let me be more precise.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Overlooking you as a key variable made the situation vastly worse.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> This city, which should have flourished in a burgeoning era of maritime trade was instead obliterated.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> So I think it&#39;s best for all involved if you hand that linden leaf over to me.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I didn&#39;t...mean for things to go this far... Well, no, maybe I did...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> As far as I&#39;m concerned...this relic is the greatest treasure in the world...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I couldn&#39;t possibly...let it be taken...for some stupid...Subspecies Holy Grail War...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Well that&#39;s no way to live.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> If Siegfried were here now, I have no doubt he would say something to the effect of...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> “I am happy to answer any summons with an eye towards the future.”</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> That does, of course, mean he may end up serving wicked people at times, but that&#39;s just part of the deal.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> More than anything, Siegfried, as a Heroic Spirit, would be thrilled to help bring about a brighter future.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> He was a good man, and a true hero. Surely anyone who thought well of him could respect that wish.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (True, I do think he&#39;d love that...)</p><hr><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> You expect me...to believe that...?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> That he would be...thrilled...to degrade himself in the service of others...?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Believe what you will, but I can guarantee you that I am right about this.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> How&#39;s that for convincing?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...What a devious con man you are.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I knew I shouldn&#39;t have trusted a man styling himself as a criminal consultant...</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> Is he...dead?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Something like that.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Ow ow ow... How&#39;re you feeling, Prince of Lan Ling?</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> I can&#39;t even move. How pathetic... This means the winner is–</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Curse you, bartender... How in the world did you get so strong...?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Trade secret!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Now then, it would seem we have ourselves a clear winner, no?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> As I&#39;ve defeated the duplicitous fourth mage, I believe that makes me, Moriarty the bartender, the winner.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> ...Wait, wait, wait! Wait just a damn minute! This isn&#39;t what we agreed on!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Think about it. Now that you don&#39;t need to spend a fortune on the auction, doesn&#39;t this put you at an advantage?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> And while I&#39;m at it, don&#39;t you think it&#39;s about time that the three of you had a serious talk?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> This business of the three of you deadlocked as you are may keep the peace, but you are all vulnerable to outside forces in consequence.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I could suck this city dry in just a few days if I wanted to, you know.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I could spin my web as any spider would, and have this city trapped and helpless in my grasp in no time.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> I... That&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> ...Yeah, I guess you&#39;ve got a point.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> Hey, Yan Qing, Diarmuid. C&#39;mere a sec.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> ...I&#39;m sure you guys are just as sick of this stalemate crap as I am.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> The old man is right. &#39;Bout time we put our honor aside.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> But how will our gangs survive without honor?</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> Maybe they won&#39;t. But you know what?</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> At least that&#39;s better than all of us getting killed.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> That&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> ... ...I can&#39;t argue with that.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> Honestly, I wish we&#39;d done this sooner.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> Guess I lost the moment I let myself be seduced by the comfort of the status quo.</p><p><strong>Gang Member C:</strong> I-I&#39;m not goin&#39; along with this! These bastards&#39;ve been–</p><p><strong>Gang Member C:</strong> Yeow! B-boss!? What&#39;s the big idea!?</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> One more word out of you idiots, and your heads come tumbling from your necks.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> ...Yeah, all right.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> I don&#39;t have to tell you what my condition is. And you&#39;ll do everything you can to make it happen, eh?</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> We want to be full citizens of this city. That&#39;s the one thing I&#39;m not budging on.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> ...I understand.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> There&#39;s bound to be some pushback with this change of direction, but I promise I&#39;ll keep it in line.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> In exchange, I&#39;ll sell my hideout and other property, and make sure to appoint a levelheaded man as my successor.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> As for my men who went out of their way to make your guys&#39; lives hell...</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> ...I&#39;ll send you a list of their names and tell their families they&#39;re away on business.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Sounds good!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (This is the scariest business talk I&#39;ve ever heard...!)</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> That&#39;s just how it is with them. They&#39;re still villains at heart, after all.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> They can never hope to coexist in prosperity, nor can only one of their gangs hope to flourish without drawing the others&#39; ire.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> So if they can&#39;t coexist in prosperity, they can at least coexist in adversity.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> They&#39;ll all suffer in turn, but they&#39;ll also all continue to survive.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Not, perhaps, an ideal lifestyle, but it comes with the assurance that they will get to die peacefully in bed.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> (Sigh) Well that&#39;s just great. We&#39;ve got nothing at all to show for our efforts.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> ...If anything, I&#39;d say we&#39;re slightly worse off than we were before.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> All that running around I did for the auction, wasted... Good grief...</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Bartender.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Tell me, what do you plan to do with that linden leaf?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> You&#39;re better off not knowing that, Count Vlad.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I might be amenable to sharing that knowledge for a price, but I sense such an arrangement would not be to your tastes.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Not to mention one wrong move, and you could end up being pumped for information yourselves in less than savory ways.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> Hmm.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> ...Yes, I suppose you&#39;re right. I should just accept my defeat, and begin searching for my next opportunity.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Damn... I was really set on getting that catalyst and winning the Subspecific Holy Grail War with it.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Looks like it&#39;s back to square one in my search for a catalyst.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> ...Well, at least I will not be leaving completely empty-handed.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> We will meet again one day, Sir Moriarty.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> James Moriarty. I&#39;ll remember that name.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Why thank you.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I&#39;m always glad to make connections with new mages.</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> ...You&#39;re a shrewd one, aren&#39;t you.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> All right, we&#39;re going to head back to our respective organizations now. What about you two?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> We&#39;re going home.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> I see.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> Go on then, get out of here.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> If I never see magecraft again, it&#39;ll be too damn soon.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I did what I came here to do, so...</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Going home, huh? Glad to hear it.</p><hr><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> ...Sir Moriarty.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> It would seem you are a far more devious villain than we mere thugs could ever hope to be.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Why, whatever do you mean?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> We may have suffered some losses, but at least they weren&#39;t fatal.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> I&#39;ll take that over the whole city being destroyed any day of the week.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I advise you all to live modestly from here on, gentlemen.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> A spider cannot weave its web when darkness covers all.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> As villains, it&#39;s your job to ensure that light and shadow come and go in equal measure.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> Thank you for the advice. Personally, I hope I never see you again.</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> Damn straight.</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> You sure you want to stick with this guy, kid? I&#39;d bail now if I were you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Believe me, I wish I could.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Hey, even a shady old man like me has feelings, you know!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;m happy with the way things turned out here.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Right? You had fun, didn&#39;t you?</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...Now then.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> All that remains is to erase Sieg&#39;s memories and strip him of his magecraft.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> That should make sure he gives up on trying to get the linden leaf back.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...So this happened in your time too, Moriarty?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You had a Holy Grail War back in your time?</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Well, no, not exactly.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> The fact that the gang leaders and mages looked and acted like Servants means that this is only a dream.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> The events of the Subspecies Holy Grail War no doubt happened differently, and in an another world entirely.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> This little dilemma of ours was a fusion of two separate occasions.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> The first, a time when a partnership I struck with mages destroyed this city. The second, a time when a Subspecies Holy Grail War took place...somewhere.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Did this turn out the way you hoped?</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...A fair question.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> The man I met with requested my help in protecting a treasure that had been in his family for generations.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I offered him several pieces of advice.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...Once you&#39;ve fanned the flames between the gangs as much as you can, fake your own death.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Convince the gangs that the relic is up for grabs now that you&#39;re dead, and that owning it will be their key to riches.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> After that, all you need to do is take their thugs out whenever it&#39;s convenient.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> But I didn&#39;t know he was a mage when I told him that...and as a result, the city quickly declined and ultimately faded away.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...Of course, as a criminal mastermind, my role in these events did not trouble my conscience.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> But now that I&#39;m your Servant, it&#39;s been eating away at me!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I swear, young [♂ man /♀ lady], you have no idea how difficult it is to be an evil Servant in the service of such a very GOOD Master!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...At any rate, when I looked back on this outcome...I chalked it up to a careless mistake.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> An awful turn of events, brought about by a few miscalculations.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Of course, even now that we&#39;ve changed the past, this remains firmly in the realm of the hypothetical.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> History remains the same, as does its outcome. What we partook in here was merely an illusion...purely for my own gratification.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I assure you, I&#39;m well aware of that.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...Yet even so, I needed to be certain this error was affixed permanently in my memory.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I needed to remind myself that a bright future such as this...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...can come to a sudden, cruel end with but a single mistake.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...Even if I should parse the records upon waking up, that still won&#39;t change what really happened.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> All I can do is cast my mind back and wonder uselessly about what might have been.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I can think of something else you can do.</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Oh? And what&#39;s that?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Next time, make sure to get it right.</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...Indeed, indeed!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Humanity is currently in the midst of an unprecedented crisis. One mistake on our part could lead to the extinction of the human race.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> So next time...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...you can be damned sure I won&#39;t miscarry so much as a single integer!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I can promise you that both as your Servant, and as your trusty partner!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Well then, it seems our time in this world is up.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Tell you what. Once we get home, I&#39;ll mix you a drink to make up for dragging you into this!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p>...A few days later.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I see my room has been redecorated without my permission... Again...</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Really? I thought I was the first to do so. Do you mean this sort of thing happens often?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Hmm, so the king Servants and princess Servants renovate your room however they like, hm?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...Well, I&#39;m glad to see you&#39;re enjoying yourself.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Now then, allow me to treat you to the drink of your life.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> First we mix these together, shake it all up, and...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Here&#39;s your cocktail, young [♂ man /♀ lady].</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Th-thank you.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I guarantee you&#39;ll like it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (This is kind of nerve-wracking...)</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ...So, what do you think?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> This is really good!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It went down a lot easier than I thought!</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Right? Right? Welcome to the adult world!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Adult...</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> ...Don&#39;t be so quick to fall for his trickery, [♂ Mr. /♀ Ms.] Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Blast! Holmes!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> That “cocktail” contains not a drop of alcohol.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> It is merely fruit juice mixed together so as to taste more like a genuine cocktail–a mocktail, to use modern parlance.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Though I suppose I can&#39;t blame you for being taken in, given the atmosphere...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Grr... Dammit, man! Can you not tell that we were having a moment!?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Uh, ahem, ahem. Listen, Master.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Alcohol really isn&#39;t very good for you, you know? Take it from an old man who&#39;s been there and done that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You tricked me!</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Well, I certainly can&#39;t approve of you becoming inebriated, [♂ Mr. /♀ Ms.] Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Still, I hope you can accept Moriarty&#39;s good fatherly intentions. Though of course, in his case–</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> If you so much as breathe the word “grandfatherly,” I will post a list of your many failings and eccentricities on the bulletin board faster than you can say “stop!”</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> THAT&#39;S what got you to shut up!?</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Anyway, don&#39;t worry.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Once you really have grown up, I&#39;ll be the first to mix you a real drink!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I would very much like to be present for that.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Of course. I&#39;ll make sure to serve you my finest glass of mud.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Hahaha, so you&#39;re not even capable of tossing your enemies the merest of bones, are you?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Hahaha, why don&#39;t you put that mouth of yours to use for once and go kiss an oncoming train?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...You know, I think I am feeling a little drunk...</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Huh? But I really didn&#39;t put any alcohol in it.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> ... ...You&#39;re drunk on the atmosphere!?</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Hey! Is it true you had some crazy stuff go down recently!?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I heard I was a bad guy. That sounds fascinating! You have to tell me all about it!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> What was I like? Was I trying to take over the world?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Did I have a scar on the side of my face?</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> What&#39;s this...? Master is showing signs of intoxication!</p><p><strong>Vlad III:</strong> ...Hmm. What do you have to say for yourself, Moriarty?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> But I didn&#39;t do it!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> Master! Are you all right!?</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> &#39;Sup! I heard there was something fun happening here, so I came to check it out!</p><p><strong>Izo:</strong> Same.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Hmm. I guess we could start by stringing up Moriarty?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> There you go. That&#39;s the ticket.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I can kick you all out, you know!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Uh, this is my room, so...</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> That&#39;s right! It is, isn&#39;t it!</p><p><strong>Yan Qing:</strong> Okay guys, how &#39;bout this?</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Yeah. There&#39;s one thing I&#39;m pretty sure we can agree on...</p><p><strong>Everyone:</strong> Let&#39;s all have a drink!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I&#39;ve never had alcohol before, Master. I can&#39;t wait to try it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;re in the same boat as me, Sieg.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You will be sticking to mocktails Sieg.</p><hr><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Aww.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> All right, all right, one at a time! Now then...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> What can I get for you, my good [♂ sir /♀ lady]?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...The fact is...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...it is very difficult for any Master to understand a truly evil man.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> One so wicked he has no qualms about destroying the world, and so meticulous he would risk his life to correct a miscalculation.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Indeed, this old spider&#39;s web extends farther than anyone can see, catching good, evil, order, and chaos alike.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> And even now, he continues to spin new threads...</p><h2 id="good-night☆talk" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#good-night☆talk" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Good Night☆Talk</h2><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Foun, fou, fooou!
