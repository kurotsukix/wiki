Speaking of which, they’re not common creatures as well.</p><p>Da Vinci is surprised that they’re intelligent life that can speak. However, Da Vinci can’t get an accurate observation of them because of the impact of the unknown singularity. Mashu says that they’re focused on monitoring Guda’s life force.</p><p>Lambda asks them what and who they are.</p><p><strong>???:</strong></p><p>That is a good question.</p><p>We are ourselves?</p><p>That’s deep.</p><p>We are just here because we are?</p><p>Of course, these things are very playful as they play with Lambda’s leviathans, Ereshkigal’s spirits and Wu Zetian’s bureaucrats. As they continue to play, the things smell the “Boss’s” scent to which a Servant comes.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/0thh1ufqd8s81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f64e87d0a092e94ad4fb4bb03f80b4b6555d6493" alt="image"></p><p><strong>???:</strong></p><p>Hm..?</p><p><strong>???:</strong></p><p>I think…they’re not sea monsters, sister.</p><p><strong>???:</strong></p><p>Well. Then that would mean— Kaahh.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Boss. Let’s play.</p><p><strong>???:</strong></p><p>We have been saved and we’re reporting! Shall I say both!</p><p><strong>???:</strong></p><p>Wait, wait, wait a bit, please? Let me speak to these people, ok?</p><p><strong>Guda:</strong></p><p>Ummm…you guys are?</p><p><strong>???:</strong></p><p>Ah…ahem.</p><p>I am Trung Trac. And this is—-</p><p><strong>???:</strong></p><p>….</p><p><strong>Trung Trac:</strong></p><p>Come on Nhi-chan, it’s rude you know? You always say that first impressions matter.</p><p>Come now, go out there and introduce yourself!</p><p><strong>???:</strong></p><p>…Trung Nhi. I am her younger sister.</p><p><strong>Trung Trac:</strong></p><p>That’s right, let’s say you barely passed. Be a bit more sociable next time.</p><p>Anyways, with that out of the way, we both are the Trung Sisters.</p><p>We realized that we were here as servants summoned to this land…is what we think.</p><p>You introduce yourselves and Da Vinci gives a run down of the situation about this microsingularity. Trung Trac understands the weight of the situation. Ereshkigal asks for information, but the Sisters don’t have any to begin with.</p><p><strong>Trung Trac:</strong></p><p>The moment we were summoned here…these kids were being attacked by some monster.</p><p>Trung Nhi praises her sister for being a charismatic leader. Trung Trac states that they came here the moment they were told one was being chased and now you’re the ones that saved them. The Trung Sisters both relay their gratitude towards you for saving them.</p><p><strong>Lambda:</strong></p><p>By the way, what are these creatures anyway?</p><p><strong>Trung Trac:</strong></p><p>You mean the Cons. I’m sorry, I don’t really get them either.</p><p>I think that they were in this region from the very beginning.</p><p>Ah, Cons is just something that I named on the spot. A more nuanced way would be “friend” in our native language.</p><p>I thought it would be troubling if I didn’t name them something.</p><p>Da Vinci asks if this is all of them, but Trung Nhi replies that this is not all of them since there are still more scattered elsewhere within the region. Even with the numbers that they have currently, they still don’t know how many of them are in total. Trung Nhi notices that we’re just standing here talking, so she invites us to talk at another place. Lambda makes a comparison between the Cons and Passionlip saying that they’re similar but not at the same time.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/c170tuard8s81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=53446926cd1e1524e8de9b184302b2d213afa7de" alt="image"></p><p><strong>==ARROW==</strong></p><p>Da Vinci starts giving the group information about the Trung Sisters.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong></p><p>The Trung Sisters were from the first century AD and northern part of Vietnam.</p><p>During that time, it was under the rule of the Han Dynasty and that district was the Han-Dynasty outpost in Vietnam.</p><p>The ruler who was sent there from the Later Han Dynasty treated people very poorly.</p><p>In the midst of smoudlering discontent and the murder of Trung Trac’s husband, the Sisters took this opportunity to initialize a rebellion…or at least that’s how it goes.</p><p>Wu Zetian is aware of this and that this is the Jiaozhou region and heard about this somewhere in her life since this is a story that was 600 years after the Sisters lived. Wu Zetian already suspects that she knows how the conclusion goes.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/fpg5ebosd8s81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea1650c0206ec24f26d85aa72adc0d9a13629aa4" alt="image"></p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong></p><p>With Trung Trac as the leader, the rebellion party had gained massive momentum and in one instance, they attacked the castle with the help of about 65 towns.</p><p>In the end, a suppression army was dispatched from the capital towards them…</p><p>Trung Trac interrupts by asking if they were talking about her and Da Vinci apologizes and admits. The Trung Sisters don&#39;t mind it all with Trung Nhi being a bit embarrassed. Trung Trac asks about the identity of Wu Zetian and Wu Zetian confirms her identity and tells them that the Sisters died 600 years before Wu Zetian was born.</p><p>Ereshkigal assumed that the Trung Sisters hated the other side because of their past, but the Sisters don’t seem to care and Trung Trac explains that the Sisters had to do what had to be done and they don’t seem to mind if an empress was standing in front of them. Trung Nhi threatens Wu Zetian that if she hurts Trung Trac one bit, she’ll cut down everyone here. Trung Trac knows that this is cold, but it’s nice to confirm your values and stances.</p><p><strong>==ARROW==</strong>:</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/rr9utldtd8s81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67c6aeeacedcce71b43204ded9ade82f550f0f15" alt="image"></p><p>You arrive at a village built on water which is where the Trung Sisters live. The sisters say that they were the ones that taught the Cons how to do things like build and were very skilled at it. They introduce you to the “Elder” of this village. Ereshkigal does not find the talking turtle to be very surprising as she refers to how talkative sheep may be. The elder says that Ereshkigal is a bit much for his age and that he prefers someone who is blunt and black haired, while Ereshkigal is jealous that he prefers someone like Ishtar than her.</p><p>Da Vinci asks who this Elder really is and Trung Trac responds that he is this very island. The Elder says that he enjoys talking with youngsters and he jokes with them by ending his sentences with “game”. Trung Trac tells the Elder to take it seriously.</p><p><strong>Elder:</strong></p><p>I am sorry.</p><p>I suppose you’re right. I have lived for a long, long, long time…I think.</p><p>I have forgotten why I am here, here on this sea…</p><p>Though I do remember one thing.</p><p>This land is supposed to be the soil on my back. A seed that has sprouted in the shape of this island.</p><p>In other words, you guys are <strong>standing on top of me</strong> right now.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/8msigqzud8s81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7072e51fac0a7a3229fa8116f48f4f46878f306b" alt="image"></p><p>Everyone is shocked by this revelation. The Trung Sisters want to talk inside a hut instead of the entrance. The Elder says that he’s sorry if it doesn’t really feel like the islands are floating, but he just kept swimming and swimming which became a habit. Da Vinci confirms that it’s true. The Elder reassures that the main body never moves and in a deep state of sleep from which it’ll never awake or it could be dead, but the Elder isn’t sure since he’s here in a very small form separated from the main body. Lambda thinks that he’s a bunrei and the Elder can’t confirm since it&#39;s been too long and now he just wants to bask in the sun along with the Cons. Wu Zetian asks his relationship to the Cons and the Elder has no affiliation with them and that they were harmful.</p><p><strong>Elder:</strong></p><p>However, I do remember this. Not to long ago—</p><p>Frightening creatures from beyond the sea, beyond the fog, started appearing.</p><p>Mashu is puzzled and Lambda wonders if it was the mermen.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/8pcqi9mvd8s81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb4df49d1e4485bc708685426b44b2a09fa48dd9" alt="image"></p><p><strong>Elder:</strong></p><p>No, it’s just not them.</p><p>There were things that possessed hoofs, things that looked like humans. There were a variety of them.</p><p>The thing they had in common was that they were all dwelling sea demons…. They were sea monsters.</p><p>And before I knew it, more and more of these sea monsters showed up and started stealing from the land, living here and devouring the Cons.</p><p>However, when everything was about to be stolen, these sisters had appeared.</p><p>They fought them off, nearly avoiding everything here from being stolen.</p><p>A good way to put this… is that only this area of the region remains.</p><p><strong>Trung Trac:</strong></p><p>Even if it was the last thing standing, I’m glad that we made it in time.</p><p>It wasn’t possible for just the two of us to go on the offensive alone like that.</p><p>But with this, we bought enough time for allies to come forth.</p><p>Da Vinci grasps the situation. Trung Truc says that they believe they were summoned here to save the Cons and can’t think of another reason why they were summoned here. Da Vinci states that this is a microsingularity because there is an anomaly and we need to fix it. Trung Trac says that sea monsters have special characteristics and asks us how we defeated the merman. We say that we just defeated them normally. Before Trac finishes her sentence, Cons are in trouble.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/ahfitdiwd8s81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2b2bab8fd42400fb3f8b8dee2bb0c64283a221b" alt="image"></p><p><strong>==ARROW==</strong>:</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/qmpk8w3xd8s81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c7a9f7c3c8a2bde17fec7d2e5b60207243c15205" alt="image"></p><p>Mashu compares the Trung Sisters as Dioscuri and Anne and Mary.</p><p>The Trung Sisters state that Cons need to do the finishing blow. Killing sea monsters fresh out the sea is fine, but if they eat a Con, they’ll just come back. However if the Cons defeat them, the monster will be defeated and the eaten Con will come back to life. The Trung Sisters continue stating that Cons can sense danger, but can’t do damage. You offer them help and Da Vinci will send in reinforcements since the Rayshifting aptitude seems to be large for multiple Servants.</p><p>Trung Trac politely asks for another favor. She wants to expand this village and wants a roof over the Cons’ heads here. We just have to bring materials and help expand.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong></p><p>We’ll send in a Servant who’s skilled at construction and gathering materials.</p><p>I’ll go ahead with the selection process.</p><p><strong>Mashu:</strong></p><p>Collecting materials and building facilities… It makes me feel very nostalgic.</p><p>This mission would be a breeze for Master!</p><p>Let’s get some materials to add onto the village first!</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/84b4lacyd8s81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a8ea20a959c518af997e54ceb12ae6a2042f4fa" alt="image"></p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/bx3srrvyd8s81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44b292b3423e05e26a5c0fe384a582aa703ace74" alt="image"></p><p>**Construction 1: Adding to the Water Village</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/64dcjhhzd8s81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7bba7cb9d5ad87ae23f9979b7e210664301afeb0" alt="image"></p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong></p><p>Hou, hou.

I’ll be the one making the decisions now whether it be a joke or not, right.</p><p>…Are you insane? Are you really insane?</p><p>Depending on your answer, this might become a tetrodotoxin case.</p><p><strong>Guda:</strong></p><p>Please!</p><p>I’ll be counting on you!</p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong></p><p>Hah.

She says that the economy is important when it involves large scale projects like this. Wu Zetian doesn’t believe that the Cons are skilled at building. Semiramis praises the Cons that they’re able to move and do this while under her leadership. With that Trung Nhi states that the Cons have a safe place to stay now and relays her thanks. Ereshkigal lets Trung Trac do the planning for specific operations and Trung Trac is nervous, but will somehow manage. The scenes with Mashu tell you to do our best to help rescue the Cons.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/6webjl10e8s81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80690cdf75ffd7a59cb7064b9fde5a8e58408a5f" alt="image"></p><h2 id="section-2-priestly-questions-and-answers" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-priestly-questions-and-answers" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 2: Priestly Questions and Answers</h2><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/v1qobq032ds81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f3bcc5a57f63921e1b63f70d2fa4a74697eb9d1" alt="image"></p><p>Trung Nhi wants to start at places that are close to the village. Ereshkigal agrees with her because it’s efficient in terms of attacking and being attacked. Trung Trac explains that in different parts of the region, there are also different kinds of sea monsters that roam around here. She also states that usually one type of species would come through the fog, but now it’s more than one and there’s a sea monster that looks like a human. The sea monster that resembles a human is an enemy that Cons cannot get a finishing blow on.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/lxh0obh32ds81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed12c58b6bd0b65fa20dd4c1ff31d2fd92ac2756" alt="image"></p><p>Benkei call them Poor Monks.

Since you can’t through the shells to strike the enemy itself and being too afraid to trigger the resurrection of the enemies, you retreat to the village to discuss further plans.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/susj7ns42ds81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d6f820311365f93dc8eb4b67a944f57f564928f" alt="image"></p><p><strong>==ARROW==</strong></p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/xyb0jh852ds81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04fe5323d67ab25300507f4ebbae313bc521958d" alt="image"></p><p>Trung Trac announces that she thinks Cons should have weapons and Trung Nhi agrees as well.

Leonidas comes in and says that a lance is the best weapon for them since it is safe and easier to wield and the Cons can be buff like he is. Amakusa thought about Black Keys, but it would be difficult for them so he suggested a pile driver since it’ll be easier for them to crack the shell.

Semiramis says that she could have had him leading the Cons. Ereshkigal asks if she will help since she’s here and Semiramis says that she won’t since she has a contract with you in collecting materials and supervising the construction and she says her farewells.

Your compliments flatter her, but she still feels down because she doesn’t know why she’s here.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/af5nvbad4ds81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95e2cea36b748d14fb4012f10f1a6c2fbc4effe5" alt="image"></p><p>Ereshkigal:</p><p>…Well, it’s a bit odd, we know nothing yet we still move forward.</p><p>I guess, the atmosphere of this island is a bit off.

As such, she even gives you a cold spirit in case you’re getting too hot to sleep.

Trung Trac is considering handing the role of leader to someone else since she’s not fit to be one. She thinks that someone is better at giving orders around and she has no self-confidence. However, she changes her mind and wants to give it her all. The Sisters start playing around and talking about how adorable the Cons are. Lambda interrupts and the Sisters try to play it off by discussing the plans.</p><p>We noticed that they were just trying to relax and we apologized. Trung Trac thinks that relaxing is a bit uncharacteristic of a leader. You say that it’s fine to relax once and a while. The Sisters say that we’re going to the next area. The sea monsters there are very strong and the Sisters have fought them multiple times. The enemies are still unknown and have other characteristics to them. Trung Nhi says that they look like dogs. Mashu says that support is on the way.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/ly74ae9ctds81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3db39c7bb4c9b2a1d6306540ae46f181fd3b8cb2" alt="image"></p><p><strong>==ARROW==</strong></p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/w9vak7sctds81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a847e25cef054e5a75ae4815431d97d3bf52a3e6" alt="image"></p><p>Nagao Kagetora arrives as support. She says that although she can’t detect the presence of enemies, she can at least kill them which is pretty much the same thing she says. She compliments Trung Trac leadership and her history.</p><p>You go into the area of influence and a water hole appears and a sea dog emerges. Kagetora doesn’t recognize it as it is not from Japan. She, then, takes one step forward and engages with the enemy. The plan of dwindling down the enemy so that the Cons can finish them is still in effect.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/m01hf0bdtds81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5bda3e31e9a4f151266a05c26be02f8e45fd45f5" alt="image"></p><p>However, the sea dog is too fast for you guys to land a hit.

The group contemplates about the monster’s speed. Kagetora thinks that it’s not fast moving</p><p><strong>Nagao Kagetora:</strong></p><p>It’s always moving to someone. In other words, it doesn’t rapidly move when there’s nothing there.</p><p>Additionally, if we look back at how it ate them front and behind—</p><p>It feels like their eye contact is unnatural.

Kiichi Hogen is here as a chaperone and tells her not to cut off any heads.</p><p>Kiichi Hogen was asked to investigate the Cons since she’s an intelligent type Servant. She is confused and surprised whether this is actually an organism or not. She feels like eating it since it looks like a steamed bun. Of course, Trung Nhi advises her not to do that.

Trung Trac compliments her beauty and Cleopatra starts talking about her beautiful aura. She senses that Trung Trac is a married wife and Trac starts talking about her husband and his death. Cleopatra apologizes for bringing up something horrific. To make up for that, she gives them coupon tickets to her beauty store. Caesar and Cleopatra talk about establishing business here since it’s tropical. Da Vinci stops the conversation and tells Caesar to demonstrate his leadership skills.</p><p>**Construction 3 Choice C: Let’s Equip Mecha Armor</p><p>Mecha Eli is delighted and starts a final strength exam to reassure the armor’s defenses and it passes. This makes Mecha Eli conclude that it will do perfectly fine against the sea monster’s teeth. Trung Nhi questions its weight since it is made out of steel. This is new technology made by Mecha Eli who doesn’t share the details. She says that it is fully compatible with their strength and speed. Trung Trac is amazed by their advancements in technology. Mecha Eli is sad that she couldn’t make more upgrades to the armor like lasers and missiles.

She gives them an English greeting which the Cons don’t know since they know the Japanese greetings. Later, the Cons meet Lakshmi Bai and use a greeting that combines English and Japanese greetings.

Trung Nhi proposes a tall watchtower that can see everything on this island. Lakshmi takes this as an opportunity to suggest that Cons assist with taking shifts and if anything happens, they can immediately report it to us. The Cons happily accept, but Trung Nhi wants them to know how to get to safety when something happens. Da Vinci says that they’ll do easy check-ups.</p><p>Now the question becomes, what kind of watchtower they want to build. Da Vinci suggests the Leaning Tower of Pisa.

The Sisters wonder who it is despite it being Nitocris, but they pet her anyway. Nitocris tells them to stop and says it’s disrespectful. You ask why she’s wearing that and she explains it is to get into the mood of building the Pyramid. She has heard that this building will serve as a watchtower and they are meant to be tall. Nitocris complains and Mashu gets worried, but the Cons don’t mind it and Nitocris allows it. Ereshkigal teases the color of their clothes. The Trung Sisters want to go to the next area but a fog envelops the area.</p><p><strong>Guda:</strong></p><p>What’s going on, a weird fog…?</p><p>Did it drift from the sea…?</p><p><strong>Trung Trac:</strong></p><p>Be careful, everyone!

Ereshkigal seems to think that they have some kind of conceptual blessing among them or increased strength under certain conditions.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/8bjdjwagvks81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3100c90dd5e2ac193603220bec7a158b6932cfa" alt="image"></p><p>Da Vinci has an informant that can provide information about the monster. Who appears on the transmission is Anastasia Summer. Anastasia was getting prepared to go to a tropical island with you in hopes that Viy would get a friend, but you didn’t call for her so she’s mad at you. Anastasia went out of her way to write down potential pranks that she could do in her notebook for when they arrive. She comes to the conclusion that the sea monster that you’re facing is a <strong>Vodyanoy</strong>.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/n1wau1pgvks81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e76a2f3770645eb37417159f70bb8355a111c4d7" alt="image"></p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong></p><p>I suppose that what’s relevant now is that “Vodyanoy prefers to be near water gates and water wheels”, I think?</p><p>I don’t remember the meaning and reasoning behind that. That’s just how it’s told.</p><p>Ereshkigal connects two and two together to come to the conclusion that what the Vodyanoys are building is similar to a water gate. Da Vinci states that maybe if you break that watergate, then their conceptual blessing will disappear. Lambda decides to use her Noble Phantasm to destroy it in order to easily defeat them.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/wbj92qchvks81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79855465c97374eb2eccdbade4f294e1f735508b" alt="image"></p><p>You defeat them, but Trung Trac states that the fog has not subsided and concludes that this isn’t the end. She continues that the fog may continue to exist for a while, but there are times where it’ll come back with the fog being thinner or thicker. Now the problem becomes about frequent attacks when the fog shows up and the attacks are in different locations. Da Vinci concludes that what we need is a Defensive Transportation System.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/1djv7qrhvks81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2881642b45a2244ecfc7b73d49b83249de459948" alt="image"></p><p>Shi Huang Di appears on screen saying that while he isn’t interested in saving the island since it is not his kingdom, he proposes this island’s version of the Great Wall of China since the Great Wall of China can act as defense and a mode of transportation as well.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/ddilrx7ivks81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64a850c99a1243a63e6b802d4f8fffde0a234962" alt="image"></p><p>Thomas Edison arrives and has heard the situation which annoys Shi Huang Di. Edison tells Shi Huang Di that while they do have different ideologies, but when it’s about engineering, he cannot back down. Therefore, he proposes a train network which doesn’t require you to do anything but to get on and relax as the motor vehicle will take you to your destination in no time. He also adds a bonus that the train can carry supplies if needed.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/6twso4pivks81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c1c2ffff4975f64ff89df37bcce41676c0909ed" alt="image"></p><p>Odysseus arrives and has heard the situation as well.

Trung Trac doesn’t have any complaints about it since she can move more smoothly now and the wall acts as a barrier. Trung Nhi is also curious about Shi Huang Di himself.</p><p>Boudica is here to assist you in carrying you around the Great Wall of China. Da Vinci notes that there are too many problems with the Great Wall. You go on Red Hare as he takes you to the location. Red Hare scares Trung Nhi and Boudica snaps at Red Hare.

Although it is one car at the moment, Edison would like to upgrade it to multiple cars. Edison does a final check on the engine and stuff and starts departing and you guys start to relax on the train. The Sisters are fascinated and impressed by such a mode of transportation while the Cons are having fun exploring the train itself. You talk about how eating tangerine is a must on a train, but you don’t know the reason for it which Trung Nhi finds a bit weird. Edison says that it’s unfortunate that while the train’s role is to transport people quickly to their destination, that would also mean being able to relax for just a short while, which Edison is trying to solve right now. We get off and fight the Vodyanoys.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/uyd9lv0mvks81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0769b2d205a255e989cb340110561a07b709179" alt="image"></p><p>**Construction 5 Choice C: Let’s Build a Trojan Horse</p><p><strong>Trung Trac:</strong></p><p>Contact from the watchtower—</p><p>Vodyanoy landing at Operation Section 7 District B, Watergate under construction!</p><p>Odysseus has prepared the Trojan Horse to be fully operational, so you go in. The Sister thinks it looks cute. Ereshkigal asks if it’s supposed to be strong. Odysseus replies that while the Trojan Horse on the island resembles his Noble Phantasm, it doesn’t mimic its strength and while its mobility is inferior to that of a horse, its job is to catapult them to the desired location and approach them on foot at high speeds. Da Vinci also compliments it.

However, her playful attitude came to an end when she had to protect her sister during the rebellion and her sister became queen. Trung Nhi did some dirty work to protect her sister which she didn’t like, but was necessary.

You guys head to the area and Ereshkigal is surprised that there’s no metaphor or tricks to it. It is actually a sea monster horse. Da Vinci and Mashu state that it is a Kelpie, a water monster within the Scottish region and takes on the form of a horse and a bird. Mashu closes it off with the horse eating anyone that dares comes close to it.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/bjh4lchaass81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7033c9406a32d08ac573c7435c71038070221496" alt="image"></p><p>The Cons are going towards the horse wanting to ride it, but in actuality they’re being eaten by the horse. Lambda stops her number one fan from being eaten as well. Da Vinci notes that Kelpie draws in their pretty through some kind of hypnosis of people trying to ride it. According to legend, if you get onto a Kelpie, you’ll never be able to get off of it. You retreat back to the village to think of a strategy to defeat this sea monster.</p><p>Back at the village, Da Vinci says that Cons like to ride something and assume this is something that they were born with. Nhi says that they enjoy using stilts and the Elder mentions that they loved riding on the back of his shell. Da Vinci proposes that they should build a cooler ride so that they won’t be persuaded to think that riding a horse is better than what they’re going to make for the Cons, so they decide to build transportation for the Cons.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/obfwdqzaass81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=36275dc164d5f926b541eeb4dedae1532b908b38" alt="image"></p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/fmsac6rbass81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cfacf2f6c02e119abd7593099fa492f9848b881a" alt="image"></p><p>Carmilla emerges and says that it doesn’t matter what you guys build as long as it mimics the horse.

Carmilla has given every Con a mini Super Car. Carmilla says that there’s unfortunately a lot of water areas so it’s hard for them to turn and such. If it were her driving her own car, she’d knock down all the trees, but says that she should’ve made it more aquatic. This makes the Kelpie confused and works successfully and Carmilla concludes that the Super Cars are cool and stylish and says that who’d choose a cow over a car.</p><p>Construction 6 Choice B: Let’s Ride a Mechanical Bull</p><p>Europa tells them to go and be careful and the Cons enjoy it very much which makes Parvati and Europa very delighted to see and hear that. Parvati says that bulls are a symbol of strength, grace and endurance. Parvati mentions how bulls are mentioned all over the world like with Iskandar. Wu mentions Nezha, Taigong along with the five-colored divine bull. The Sisters think about how cute the bulls are and think about elephants and how they’re also similar to bulls.

The downside to this vehicle is that it can’t fly up that high since it&#39;s set at a certain elevation and can go horizontally.

Mashu says that roughly over half the island is captured by you. The Elder wants to say something but doesn’t remember, but then he remembers that he wanted to ask the Sisters a favor. Inside the tent, the Sisters start explaining that we have to expand the village once more due to an overpopulation problem with the Cons. Trung Nhi suggests another neighborhood that’s above the water, but you have to consider that Semiramis is doing all the work, so we’re open to suggestions.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/2h6jvpn0gxs81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b252d5035d7dd3cfd14da987a084b8e6dfe1184b" alt="image"></p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/cnuvb5j1gxs81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d76609014113e933a86a381d1fe9484b2fc4eb3f" alt="image"></p><p>Marie Antoinette emerges and proposes a massive ship like a luxury cruise for everyone to live on. Nobunaga pops up and tells us to hold and says that we should, of course, build a houseboat. She continues that it’ll have all the Japanese formal rooms and dishes and if there’s a fire, just jump into the water since there’s exits already available. MHX can’t think of aquatic building, but proposes a colony ship since space is better than water. She adds that there’ll be functions for life in the case the planet dies. Da Vinci is slightly annoyed that they’re coming in and suggesting what they want, but reminds you that you’re the one who’ll decide in the end.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/xgml3qy2gxs81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=730e4e897639644b1231447bd018ce60a80d932c" alt="image"></p><p>**Construction 7 Choice A: Let’s Live on a Luxury Cruise Ship</p><p>Overall, everyone seems to be impressed with the ship since it comes with a lot of rooms for different purposes. Robin Hood is there and Da Vinci compliments that it’s like a hotel with a great deck. Marie Antoinette wants to do a Titanic reference where the man supports the woman from behind while the woman stands at the edge of the deck with both looking at the horizon. However, Kiyohime Summer does not approve of that. A Con jumps off the ship since it seems fun, so they rescue them and Lambda scolds them.</p><p>**Construction 7 Choice B: Let’s Live on a Houseboat</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/uykz2ww7gxs81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90c42455c49f46272cfc4a62f65765bebfc7e96b" alt="image"></p><p>Every GUDAGUDA character is there on the houseboat having a big party. Beniemna is the main cook for the houseboat. Saito Hajime states that the houseboat should’ve had a bit more charm to it and asks why Okita is in swimsuits. She responds that “we’re in a southern country (?)”. The Cons enjoy their time in the houseboat since it has a very fun environment. The Sisters ask if it’s ok to sit down and lie down and you say it is ok. They sit down and start sleeping, which you let them do without interrupting them.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/2br4wlg8gxs81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=300ad75d745e897c5c01a3cb9b1ca0f604cb72ec" alt="image"></p><p>**Construction 7 Choice C: Let’s Live on a Colony Ship</p><p>The Trung Sisters are impressed by this unknown technology. Mysterious Heroine X shows the Sisters around and shows them a cockpit and it doesn’t function, it’s just a replica, but she wants to expand it when the time comes which will be next season. The window is just a wallpaper. She sees Cons and puts them out of the way and makes the excuse that she couldn’t afford a weightless machine since it was too expensive. Mysterious Heroine X is curious about the Cons comparing them to aliens. As long as they are not sabers, it is fine. Trung Trac seems to be impressed that the Cons like it and that the ship is wind and water resistant.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/bugfdi89gxs81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04cb49325a97221cd8a6c2a3d12c33a3d4ada488" alt="image"></p><h2 id="chapter-13-a-waterside-song-is-an-invitation-to-eternity" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#chapter-13-a-waterside-song-is-an-invitation-to-eternity" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Chapter 13 - A Waterside Song is an Invitation to Eternity</h2><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/b0b3s3z6m5t81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=271e1b0d3b2775f45ca840d7134fa2b4168128c1" alt="image"></p><p>Mashu states that after we gave the Cons mounts, weapons and armor, we began to raid the next area. There were new sea monsters in the next area but they had confidence that they could pull through. However, in the end, we retreated back to the village since the new monsters do mental attacks to the Cons. A flashback to the battle, a female spirit sings a song which makes the Cons approach them. Vritra who came to help already succumbed to the attack. Da Vinci managed to tell them to retreat.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/u8lvnnp7m5t81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c31e85e4a44a955b0776f1396885dc5d0ac871b" alt="image"></p><p>Anastasia tells you that the sea monster this time around is called a Rusalka. It&#39;s a legend that they lure people in with songs and drag them into the water. She continues to say that they’re like the Vodyanoy’s wife, but she doesn’t know how true it is, but it doesn’t matter.</p><p>Lambda’s number one fan comes in and says that while her number one fan was in danger, it managed by knowing that Lambda was more beautiful than her. Lambda is very excited to hear that, but also indicates that if the Cons get to know fun cultures that are better than the Rusalka, then they won’t be succumbed by them.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/moar0df8m5t81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c2cc9bc64e011c9e62274ba639416d011fa3193" alt="image"></p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/gn224mx8m5t81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c8694b1f096b77a8335bb31fbe68f328b5995bb" alt="image"></p><p>Nero comes in and says that entertainment was very popular in Rome that she proposes a theater. Tomoe Gozen emerges and proposes a Game Center since a house of electronic entertainment suited for our era which Hinako and Osakabehime agree to. Murasaki Shikibu appears and suggests that there is some fun in reading books so she suggests a Library. Trung Nhi that this is neat and that the decision is up to you.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/z3cylay9m5t81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17efc138716f814f44c884022ac44eab69beb676" alt="image"></p><p>**Construction Quest 8 Choice A: Let’s Build a Theater</p><p>Nero’s theater is complete and says that she would have put on a one man show for everything and says that it is not adequate. So Nero puts on a very spectacular show by making Scheherazade put on an exciting story for the Cons. Everyone seems to enjoy the story that Scheherazade puts on which is just horror and exciting stories. After that, Mata Hari puts on a dance show for everyone. Charlotte Corday is next to put on a magic show for everyone. For the end, Nero concludes everything and Elizabeth puts on a musical which the scene ends with a To Be Continued.</p><p>**Construction Quest 8 Choice B: Let’s Build a Game Center</p><p>Hinako, Osakabehime and Tomoe Gozen state that there are a variety of games in different genres. Tomoe is shocked that she didn’t account for the size which Hinako demonstrates that the Cons are playing together with one using the levers and one using the buttons. Tomoe will make adjustments later to fit the Con’s size. The Trung Sisters try to play some games, but are more suited with physical games like air hockey. Trung Nhi makes a new record in shooting the goal but she mistakenly tossed a Con which she is extremely sorry for.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/0eb7m5bcm5t81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26602c12e2e2bb2c16ed915edae7a9ee66cfe2d3" alt="image"></p><p>**Construction Quest 8 Choice C: Let’s Build a Library</p><p>Murasaki Shikibu states that she would have helped with the construction if she had time. The Trung Sisters and the Cons are having fun reading. Jeanne Lily, Jack the Ripper, Paul Bunyan and Nursery Rhyme are also there and having fun with the Cons. Murasaki Shikibu has done some research on the Trung Sisters and is surprised by how much there is about them. The Cons asks Murasaki Shikibu if she has a book for them and says that she has a picture book for them. She is surprised that the book is upside down and is surprised that they’re improvising a new story and doing a read aloud. With this, she’ll be at the counter if you need anything and she is inspired to create something new.</p><h2 id="chapter-14-fourth-area-recapture-battle" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#chapter-14-fourth-area-recapture-battle" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Chapter 14 - Fourth Area Recapture Battle</h2><p>You return back to the area and fight off the Rusalka, but the Cons seem to can’t get the things they’ve enjoyed out of their head which means that they’re resisting the Rusalka’s mental attacks. Lambda states that Cons can’t distinguish between reality and games and tells her number one fan not to be like them since her Con. Lambda continues to tell them to be careful when doing the finishing blow. Trung Trac tells them to give it their all since this is the last area.</p><p><strong>==BATTLE==</strong></p><p>Benkai and Mashu praise them for winning and that this is natural. Da Vinci states that while they’re relaxing and resting, she wants to take this time to review their information. Da Vinci states that this would have been easier if Sherlock Holmes didn’t take a day off from work, but Anastasia says that it’s normal to take a day off. Da Vinci goes over the characteristics and features of the enemies we’ve encountered so far which are the Merman, Hermit Crabs, Bunyips, Vodyanoys and Rusalkas. They conclude that none of them are clues on narrowing down the region. Da Vinci tries to find some significant commonality and outlier between them. Da Vinci shares her opinions, but it is not shared with the reader.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong></p><p>Unfortunately, we can’t draw any conclusions just yet.</p><p>However, there’s a possibility that it was the beginning of everything.</p><p>That’s right…this anomaly has appeared before us from the very beginning and why I feel like the place is the “Unknown Coordinate Singularity”...</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/gyuoiv4nm5t81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a900c23bd6ce72cff0fa1b6e68be3e5419a303a4" alt="image"></p><h2 id="chapter-15-preparation-for-a-sea-battle" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#chapter-15-preparation-for-a-sea-battle" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Chapter 15: Preparation for a Sea Battle</h2><p>The Sisters begin the meeting to explain that there are isolated areas within the region that have pulled in more water than anywhere in the region. The monsters within these secluded areas are a multitude of fishmen, which isn’t anything special, but they are high in numbers. However, in order to get to these areas, you’ll need a boat with navigation and combat.</p><p>Drake, Blackbeard and Bartholomew recommend a pirate ship since it has combat. However the three of them have differing opinions on what kind of ship it’ll be. Mordred wants a hovercraft. Hokusai proposes a utsuro-bune which she was inspired by old books. Trung Trac was dozing off during suggestion time, but it’s always up to you to decide.</p><p><strong>Construction 9 Choice A: Let’s Embark on a Pirate Ship</strong></p><p>Drake is amazed by how smart the Cons are with how they built this ship. Mashu asks what the ship’s name will be and they want to mash up all the names, thus, The Queen Anne’s Golden Royal. Drake says it should be the Golden Royal’s Revenge. Bartholomew says it should be the Royal Anne Hind Mekakure Fortune which Drake cannot believe that there’s someone stupider than Blackbeard himself.</p><p><strong>Construction 9 Choice B: Let’s Embark on a Hovercraft</strong></p><p>Mordred is impressed and says that it’s smoother than surfing. Gareth and Mashu try to calm her down by saying that this is a test run. The Trung Sisters are worried in the end since Artoria Alter (Maid) shot her Noble Phantasm at the Hovercraft and the Hovercraft successfully evaded it.</p><p><strong>Construction 9 Choice C: Let’s Embark on a Utsuro-bune</strong></p><p>Hokusai tells the story of the Utsuro-bune which was a boat that was shaped like a box, with glass overhead and many layers of steel at the very bottom. Da Vinci likes the mystery since Hokusai states that a exotic woman held the mysterious box and that the ship was found in the Edo period. They speculate that the box could be something sentient and Da Vinci ends it off with that the woman never let go of the box and let anybody near or touch it.</p><p>People never tried to understand the woman and she was exiled back into the sea. Da Vinci tells Jeanne Alter Lily that mysteries should stay mysteries and Hokusai doesn’t care as long as it appears good for her.</p><h2 id="chapter-16-night-before-the-decisive-battle" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#chapter-16-night-before-the-decisive-battle" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Chapter 16: Night Before the Decisive Battle</h2><p>You wake up in the middle of the night to take a walk in the village when you encounter Trung Trac. She says that she couldn’t sleep when she remembers that Servant don’t really need such things, but says that she’s nervous or even scared.</p><p>Trung Trac says that she’s constantly remembering her rebellion and the failing result. Everyone who followed her was killed and she feels heavily guilty and compares it to as if she killed her sister. She thought that the Cons were an attempt to redeem herself, but it is not a guarantee that it won’t happen once more so she tried to stay brave in front of everyone despite not being able to convince herself as she questions the throne and how she became one. She calls herself a poor ruler and just a naive girl, but you say that she’s a good leader. You comfort her that she’ll win since she has her sister, the Cons and us. Trung Trac is motivated by your words and will protect them.
