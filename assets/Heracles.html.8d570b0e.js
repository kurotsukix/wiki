This is bad! The nearby village is being attacked by wild beasts!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> And it happened quite suddenly, it seems.

I hope it will be all right...the village, I mean...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Not just the fields are being destroyed, the buildings are as well... Doctor! Get us details on the enemy!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I am, already! What? Whoa! Their numbers are incredible! It&#39;s completely surrounded!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master, we&#39;ll just have to take them out as we see them!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You got it!

Berserker doesn&#39;t see the child!

Fujimaru, was the girl...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No, Doctor. She&#39;s all right. He&#39;s going after what&#39;s behind her!</p><p><strong>Werebeast:</strong> Gyarrrh!</p><p><strong>Girl:</strong> Waaaah! That scared meeee...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Now, now. It&#39;s all right. Run off somewhere safe, all right?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...Whew! Thank goodness the girl is fine.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Oh, that&#39;s right! Berserker must be directing his hostility toward large foes first. That&#39;s why he\u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Doctor, how many survivors are left?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Oh, man! We&#39;re surrounded by enemies! You&#39;re in an even worse situation than before!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Then let&#39;s go nuts!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Crush them, Berserker!</p><hr><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Heracles:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Oh, Fujimaru, I figured out why Berserker did what he did earlier.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Earlier? Oh, you mean when that girl was spared by Heracles.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Yes, that. I thought there was something odd about it, so I did some digging and found out the Madness Enhancement on Heracles,</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> is actually rather weak. It leaves a tiny bit of his reasoning intact.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> So, earlier, thanks to that bit of reasoning, he didn&#39;t attack the girl.</p><p><strong>Heracles:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, I see. But why is Heracles&#39;s Madness Enhancement so weak?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Well, that&#39;s because Madness Enhancement was originally a skill meant to forcefully strengthen weak Servants.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> But when it comes to a Servant like Heracles, driving him mad consumes massive amounts of magical energy.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> In other words, the Madness Enhancement level is reduced, enabling him to manifest by using less energy.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Anyway, the fact that you don&#39;t have that much magical energy, Fujimaru, also plays a role in that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You mean to say, Heracles&#39;s current status is much weaker than what he could&#39;ve been?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> But even at that, it&#39;s far stronger than most Heroic Spirits.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Rather, I am kind of scared to find out what he could&#39;ve been.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Well, I see...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> So, he&#39;d be even stronger than now.</p><hr><p><strong>Heracles:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...But I&#39;m sure that even at Heracles&#39;s original state of madness, that girl still would have been safe.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> No, no. I really doubt that. He&#39;s a Berserker, you know. A Berserker!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;re right. I&#39;m sure of it too.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Heracles wouldn&#39;t do that.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;m not so sure about that...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, for sure...!</p><p><strong>Heracles:</strong> ...</p><h2 id="the-13th-labor" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-13th-labor" aria-hidden="true">#</a> The 13th Labor</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m sorry, Master. Look what&#39;s happened...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s not your fault, Mash.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Now is when things get good!</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> You only meant to exterminate the beasts. Who knew that it would become a fight for survival...</p><p><strong>Heracles:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Even Heracles is wiped out, thanks to him going rampage for three days and nights...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Is this...a labyrinth?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Yep, Fuyuki&#39;s underground labyrinth... Where the Massive Cavern located. I&#39;m picking up an odd response at the far end of the labyrinth.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It&#39;s either remnants of the Singularity, or a dimensional disturbance. Either way, we can&#39;t just ignore it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We have to eradicate it while its roots are still small. Let&#39;s get going right away, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> And, we fell right into a trap... It&#39;s a parting present from Professor Lev, dammit!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Not only there&#39;s no singularity here, there&#39;s nothing here period. And the way to the exit is packed with enemies.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> And it looks like you&#39;re being trapped inside a magical dimension, keeping the communication up is the best I can do, let along interfering.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...! Here they come again! Let&#39;s do this, Heracles!</p><p><strong>Heracles:</strong><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png" alt="berserk1">\u2013!!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Haa...haa...</p><p><strong>Heracles:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> A-Are you all right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, we got through it somehow... But at this rate, we&#39;ll eventually be wiped out...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;m not sure I want to say this, but... we aren&#39;t completely out of options.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What is it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Tell us.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> You know Berserker... I told you about it before, right? Heracles&#39;s madness is...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It&#39;s not a true &quot;Madness Enhancement.&quot; He can be even more powerful...</p><p><strong>Heracles:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You mean, his original &quot;Madness Enhancement&quot;...?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Yes...If we can restore his &quot;Madness Enhancement,&quot; there might be...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> a way out of this predicament...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> All right! Let&#39;s do it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> But it seems like there&#39;s some problem with it, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Like I told you before, in order to power up a Heroic Spirit like Heracles using Madness Enhancement,</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> we need an incredible amount of magical energy... So much is needed, that it would kill an ordinary mage.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Besides, there&#39;re many tales of Heracles in his madness. What&#39;s more, every time he&#39;s enraged, some tragedy occurs as well.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I&#39;m against doing it. I can&#39;t allow you to expose Senpai to such a danger.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> But, you&#39;ve reached your limit, right, Mash...? There&#39;s no other way...</p><p><strong>Heracles:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> All right! Let&#39;s do it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> We&#39;re never making it out anyway!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So, how do I do this?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Tell me how to do it.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It&#39;s easy to accomplish. You simply need to pray for it. You just need to change the original summon chant a little.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> \u2013Thy body shall be consumed with madness... or something like that.</p><p><strong>Heracles:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> This is bad. The enemy&#39;s about to unleash their strongest yet. A phantasmal, worse yet, a dragon.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;m not going to force you to do it. Fujimaru, you have to decide.</p><p><strong>Heracles:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Thy body shall be consumed with madness!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai!!!</p><p><strong>Heracles:</strong> ...!!</p><p><strong>Dragon:</strong> Gaaaaaarrrrrr!</p><p><strong>Heracles:</strong><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png" alt="berserk2">\u2013!!!!!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Incredible...So this is Heracles&#39;s true power...</p><p><strong>Heracles:</strong><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png" alt="berserk2">\u2013!!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> We&#39;re in trouble!

You&#39;re really quite something.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Well, hardly...I mean, later I...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> To be honest, I fainted.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> So, when you activated the Madness Enhancement, Fujimaru, your energy supply ran out.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Then Berserker also ran out of fuel and stopped moving...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No. Actually, after that, Heracles alone wiped out all the monsters in that area.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I know it&#39;s hard to believe, but...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Hmm, so it&#39;s possible we still didn&#39;t fully activate his &quot;Madness Enhancement?&quot;</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> No, way!

Even a great Heroic Spirit of Olympus couldn&#39;t be that incredible, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Who&#39;s to say?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> At any rate, it was a big help.</p><hr><p><strong>Heracles:</strong> ...(grin)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What?
