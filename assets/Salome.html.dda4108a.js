Hm, well, regardless of whether you\u2019re a princess or not, you\u2019re a Heroic Spirit of Chaldea now, so you\u2019re not exempt from having your mental attitude always readied for battle.

That\u2019s the topic here.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> I see, I see. \u201CAlways readied for battle\u201D is a term I recall hearing about before, actually.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> That was a phrase from Master\u2019s homeland, right? It\u2019s a good one, it fits strangely well with us Celtic roughnecks.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> It\u2019s an idea that every bold hero should keep close to their heart. I, for one, certainly think I should.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Don\u2019t you think you\u2019re the embodiment of the idea?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> No, certainly not.
