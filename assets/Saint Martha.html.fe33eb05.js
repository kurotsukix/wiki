Yes, the kind of normal girl you&#39;d find in any town.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I lived happily with my little sister and brother, even though we quarreled from time to time.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I was born in Bethany, and raised in the same town.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I thought that I&#39;d live my life the same as everyone else.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> ...No. Actually, how shall I put it? Perhaps I never even thought about the future.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Because I was always busy. What should we have for dinner tonight? What would tomorrow&#39;s weather be\u2013</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I was always running around, even when &quot;He&quot; was there.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> While my sister listened to &quot;His&quot; words, all I did was worry about making guests feel welcomed.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Martha, you were a girl who put her family first. I think that&#39;s admirable.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;re naturally friendly.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I think it&#39;s nice.</p><hr><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I wonder about that. Aren&#39;t you disappointed?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Saints whom people love always seem to shine...Yes, like Jeanne d&#39;Arc.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Both Jeanne and you seem like shining saints to me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> In loving people, you became their hope. That&#39;s the sort of women you are.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s why I think you equally deserve to be called saints.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> ...Thank you, Mash Kyrielight.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Don&#39;t mention it\u2013</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Oh, sorry to interrupt, but I&#39;m detecting multiple magical signatures in the sea ahead.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Just as Martha feared, there&#39;s some sort of distortion on the Marseille coast as it&#39;s being repaired.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Doctor, do we need to dive under the sea?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I doubt it. If push comes to shove, my Tarasque will guide the &quot;swarm&quot; to the shore.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Swarm?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fooou?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Guide? Wait, is Fou there with you?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Yes. That&#39;s a swarm, without a doubt. My trait allows me to accurately detect that.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> A swarm of an incomplete subspecies of dragon. Something that shouldn&#39;t be in this area of the 15th century.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> GYAAAAAA\u2013!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...That&#39;s the roar of a wyvern!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I see! As expected of the Saint of Dragons! You sensed the swarm of wyverns gather.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Prepare for battle!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Martha, call the Tarasque!</p><hr><p><strong>Martha:</strong> ...This is nothing. This coast was once part of the Tarasque&#39;s domain.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Born of Leviathan, created by God on the Fifth Day\u2013 he is a fierce monster many a brave man tried to slay.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Now the Tarasque exists with me. The sad dragon who knows not of love.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Go now Tarasque, wielding a burning heat equal to the sun...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Grant momentary peace to these creatures made pitiful by the moment of their birth\u2013</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> St. Martha&#39;s magical energy is rising! I-Is this turning into a battle of Kaiju Tarasque vs. Wyvern Army?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The wyvern swarm is approaching! Time for battle, Senpai!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Battle&#39;s over. No\u2013 more are coming! Confirming a trailing swarm!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> There&#39;s just no end to them! This is annoying!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Hm?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Martha, did you just\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I must have imagined it.</p><hr><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Did something happen, everyone? Come on, let&#39;s hang on a little longer. FIGHT!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> FIGHT!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I must have imagined it.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um, uh, right. We&#39;re going to continue the battle! Senpai, your orders, please!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I confirm the enemy is completely destroyed! We did it, Senpai!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> \u2013Ha. You&#39;re no match for us, lizards. Did those mere wyverns hope to best me and the Tarasque?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> They&#39;re just peeping hatchlings, fresh from their eggs.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> !!!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Y-Your Holiness?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Lalala, I don&#39;t hear anything.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Martha:</strong> ...Ahem. Thus return the poor souls who know not of love.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> God&#39;s love is equal. Yes, in the past, the Tarasque was treated the same.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Y-Yes.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;m sure.</p><hr><p><strong>Martha:</strong> When dragons choose slaughter and refuse to listen, the use of force is the only way\u2661</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> O-Oh ...Terrible... I mean, total respect, Your Holiness!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> St. Martha may be a saint, but she&#39;s also an extremely gifted dragon slayer, isn&#39;t she?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I see that now. Senpai, she&#39;ll be a very dependable Servant.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Oh, you&#39;re too kind. I&#39;m just\u2013</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> \u2013Just a magnificent dragon slayer\u2661</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Huh\u2013? She called herself a dragon slayer?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Foou, foufou!</p><h2 id="the-desired-saint" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-desired-saint" aria-hidden="true">#</a> The Desired Saint</h2><p><strong>Martha:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Yes, Fou. But please be quiet for now.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Martha, is something bothering you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What&#39;s with this atmosphere?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, Martha&#39;s on edge, isn&#39;t she? Ever since we came to this era.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> There&#39;s something wrong in Ancient Rome, in the Second Singularity. It was her\u2013It was Martha who told us that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I assume it&#39;s not a good news. Could it be related to the dragons again?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> If so, then that&#39;s odd. Wasn&#39;t she all excited about it before?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Maybe it&#39;s personal this time?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But the era she lived in before\u2013 was the 1st century, wasn&#39;t it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What could it be?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I have no idea\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Martha:</strong> ...Normally.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> It&#39;s normally not possible, because all souls are under God&#39;s divine grace.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Wandering the Earth, not going to either Heaven or Hell.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Such acts are not allowed, I mean, all of the...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Original Sins have already...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Martha?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The souls\u2013 Oh! I detect a magical energy reaction! A large amount, dead ahead!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Based on the signature pattern, ghosts are coming, be careful!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Mash, prepare for battle!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Martha, time for battle!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Martha:</strong> ...Damn.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Damn! A saint said damn? Uh, d-did I say something wrong?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I said it&#39;s freaking impossible... And what&#39;s with that stupid amount.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I thought I said all souls, are under the God&#39;s divine grace...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Lalala, I can&#39;t hear anything.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Martha!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So I didn&#39;t imagine it last time. Something&#39;s wrong with Martha\u2013</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Yes, you&#39;re right! You&#39;re definitely right! Souls wandering the Earth is normally &quot;not possible!&quot;</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Sending them back to God&#39;s grace, yes. But ghost-type monsters, really?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> They only exist because of magecraft, they aren&#39;t &quot;naturally&quot; generated.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> In other words, they aren&#39;t part of nature. But, hold on, if that&#39;s the case then Heroic Spirits\u2013</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Ohh, oh, ohhhh\u2013</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> ...I told you.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> This is freaking impossible. Why do they appear before us, especially\u2013</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> ...before me!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> St. Martha&#39;s magical energy level is rising! S-Senpai, she&#39;s going to unleash her Noble Phantasm!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Without the Master&#39;s order? S-She&#39;s pissed! O-Oh no, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> With Kaiju Tarasque on the rampage Rome is done for! Get her under control! T-To battle!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Eliminate those ghost as soon as you can! Is that clear?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Mash, prepare for battle!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Hostiles, destroyed! ...The battle&#39;s over, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This should put Martha back to being her usual quiet self...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Foou...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> If she&#39;s not back to normal, then, Umm\u2013 Right, of course. I&#39;ve got it, you two!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> There&#39;s still something there. Rather, she&#39;s here because she sensed &quot;this.&quot;</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Something much larger than a mere ghost. This is, yes, the sixth imaginary element\u2013</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Its true nature is unknown, but at the very least, its magical energy indicates is &quot;that&quot;.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I sense it, too.

Back to hell with you!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> No matter what era it is, there&#39;s no place for demons.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> ...Because all original sins were carried away by &quot;Him.&quot;</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Martha...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> All right, the battle&#39;s over.
