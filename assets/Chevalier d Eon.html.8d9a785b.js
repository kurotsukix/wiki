But, thank you.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> Something is going to happen here, in this era. I can&#39;t shake that feeling.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> So that&#39;s why I insisted on this, and now here we are...in the Paris of a bygone age.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> Honestly, I hope we find nothing, but in that case...hmm.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> It&#39;ll mean I&#39;ve wasted your time. I apologize, you&#39;re probably tired from the constant fighting.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Don&#39;t worry about it. It seems like Senpai is feeling restless anyway.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yeah, I just can&#39;t fall asleep.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I feel wide-awake.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Maybe there&#39;s some kind of connection with what d&#39;Eon&#39;s feeling.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> That&#39;s right, Masters and Servants are connected through magical energy, so it&#39;s possible.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> One recorded example is the phenomenon of shared memories within dreams.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I imagine there are other examples as well. It&#39;s quite intriguing.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. He, umm, I mean she\u2013 wait, uh\u2013</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> Haha, either is fine. Sometimes I am a man, and sometimes woman.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> You may refer to me however you wish. Hey Fujimaru, what do I look like to you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> A woman, I guess?</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> Hehe... So that&#39;s how I look.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> A man, I guess?</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> Hmm... So that&#39;s how I look.</p><hr><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> I&#39;m the Knight of the White Lily, sworn to defend France&#39;s royal family. Gender means nothing to me.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> Sometimes I&#39;m a saber-wielding dragoon. Sometimes I&#39;m an elegant lady in a dress.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> If it&#39;s to defend the royal family, I won&#39;t hesitate to use a saber or a dress.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> That remains as true now as it was when I was alive. Being a Heroic Spirit doesn&#39;t change that.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> Also...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ???</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou?</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> I committed a crime. I remember my manifestation in this world as Berserk Saber.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> Not just at all of you... I even pointed my blade at &quot;the one&quot; who&#39;s the very symbol of the royal family.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> I want to atone for that. Forgive me Master Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> Instead of fulfilling my duties as a Servant, I am now acting to fulfill my duties as a defender of the royal family.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> Please forgive me, even if it&#39;s only for a night.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> Please give me a chance. Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Don&#39;t worry about it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Sure, I don&#39;t feel like sleeping anyway.</p><hr><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> ...Thank you, Master.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou! Kyuuuuuu!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Magical energy detected, Senpai! Multiple units in the town ahead!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It seems that d&#39;Eon&#39;s worry was justified! If anything comes up, we can also Rayshift!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Multiple signatures approaching our position! We might have to fight!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Senpai!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Get ready for battle!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, Master!</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> Shadowy beings lurking in Paris&#39;s twilight hours\u2013 I, the Knight of the White Lily, shall be your opponent!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Enemy unit destroyed. It&#39;s likely that the target&#39;s composition was magical in nature.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> A ghost-type monster. The fact it lacks a physical body is troublesome, so I&#39;m glad you&#39;re the ones against it.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Even against monsters immune from physical attacks, a Servant can still fight with no problems.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Since Servants are composed of magical energies, all your attacks are still effective against non-physical targets.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> A fine opponent. We&#39;re quite lucky then.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> &quot;We&#39;re quite lucky?&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d put it that way...</p><hr><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> Another group is approaching! Master, looks like another fight!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Kyu! Foou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai, please take care of Fou! Also,\u2013your orders please!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I thought the battle would continue, but it seems like there are no more enemies in this area.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> Hmm, I don&#39;t know about that.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> This feeling... Something&#39;s close. It&#39;s cleverly hiding itself, but it&#39;s definitely there.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> Reveal yourself! Present yourself before the royal family&#39;s august lily!</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> You who haunts Paris during the dead of night! \u2013Wretched ghost mired in wickedness!</p><p><strong>E:???:</strong> ...Death...to the royal family...</p><p><strong>E:???:</strong> ...Freedom...to the people...</p><p><strong>E:???:</strong> ...We, the people, no longer need the white lily of the royal family...</p><p><strong>E:???:</strong> ...Thus...</p><p><strong>E:???:</strong> ...The revolution shall sweep Paris...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> !?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Foou!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I am picking up a powerful reading! This is different than a Servant, it&#39;s closer to the ghosts we encountered.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> ...I know who this is.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> The strength of this man&#39;s convictions. He sought freedom for the people and castigated the royal family.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> In days and nights long past, I once crossed swords in the shadows with this man.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> You&#39;re... I see. So it&#39;s you who summoned me.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> \u2013Maximilien Robespierre.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> What! Robespierre!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Uh, who?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> He&#39;s famous in history!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. Maximilien Robespierre was the world&#39;s first terrorist and an instigator of the revolution\u2013</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> B-But, hold on a second. Whatever that is, it doesn&#39;t look like a Servant!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The first Holy Grail... It has influenced Paris and conjured up a ghost!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Everything&#39;s a mess, and the era is out of control. The Holy Grail makes such things possible\u2013</p><p><strong>Ghost of Robespierre:</strong> ...Death...to the royal family...</p><p><strong>Ghost of Robespierre:</strong> ...Death...Death, death...</p><p><strong>Ghost of Robespierre:</strong> ...Death to all...who oppose the revolution...</p><p><strong>Ghost of Robespierre:</strong> ...Ah, yes, upon everyone and everything...</p><p><strong>Ghost of Robespierre:</strong> ...Purge...and death!</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> He has lost sight of his own justice. Robespierre...</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> I could judge your life as an evil one, but now all you wish is death upon everything.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> You shall fall before a knight of France. \u2013By the sword of the White Lily!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master, your orders, please!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> \u2013It&#39;s over, poor ghost!</p><p><strong>Ghost of Robespierre:</strong> ...ah, aah, ah, aaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...</p><p><strong>Ghost of Robespierre:</strong> ...It&#39;s disappearing, everything...</p><p><strong>Ghost of Robespierre:</strong> ...France, liberty...to where...</p><p><strong>Ghost of Robespierre:</strong> ...do you fade away...</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> No, Robespierre. They will not fade away.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> France&#39;s royalty may vanish. Perhaps revolutionaries like you will fall as well.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> But France itself will never die. It may change its shape or form, but it will continue to exist.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> As long as this world exists. So I leave you with these words.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> \u2013Vive la France!</p><p><strong>Ghost of Robespierre:</strong> ...Ah, Vive la...</p><p><strong>Ghost of Robespierre:</strong> ...Fr...an...ce...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> \u2013Magical energy signature eliminated.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Foou...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Good work, d&#39;Eon.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Now he can rest in peace.</p><hr><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> ...Yes.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> Thanks to you, we were able to bring him peace.
