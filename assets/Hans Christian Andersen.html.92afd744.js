It&#39;s good to see that you&#39;re not looking disgruntled today.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> I am so disgusted with my super-boring life that my brain has turned to stone.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> I feel like as if I&#39;ve been transformed into a dumb monkey. I&#39;m overwhelmingly lacking enrichment in my life.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Look. Don&#39;t you have anything to say as my Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Stone bread?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Enrichment?</p><hr><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Huh? You don&#39;t know the taste of a completely-dried bread? Scandinavians start their breakfast</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> by forcefully washing down a piece of rock-like bread with a drink like lead-boiled water...</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Well, that trivia aside, what I want to say, Fujimaru, is...</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Give me something new to write about, or if you don&#39;t have anything, then give me some money. I&#39;ll have some fun at the bar to kill some time.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Senpai, Mr. Andersen is sounding more arrogant and reprehensible than ever.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Did you do anything to get on his bad side?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I didn&#39;t do anything.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Andersen is always like this.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So you say you&#39;re not at fault. Of course. That&#39;s what I remember, too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Mr. Andersen. We don&#39;t have any resources to waste here at Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Please behave yourself, and work on a new book. Personally, I request a sequel of The Little Mermaid...</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Tch. That story is so popular among women and kids.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> I wrote that story to mock the idiots in this world, so I don&#39;t understand why it would be taken as a touching tale.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What\u2014M-Mister, what did you just say?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> I said, that is one of the worst trash that I ever wrote, you fool!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Geez. I made the ending so obvious, but people kept calling it a tragedy or tragic love story.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Not only is she finally released from love at first sight, but she even gets a soul as a reward in the end!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Listen. The best part about love is when it&#39;s purely yours. That&#39;s my conclusion, at least.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> You ask me to write a sequel, but why can&#39;t you understand it would only drive Little Mermaid to further despair?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> \u2014</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Uh... What, you look like it&#39;s the end of the world. ...</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> I&#39;m saying, don&#39;t ask me to write a sequel to a story that ended already. It&#39;s the reader&#39;s privilege to imagine what happens after the ending.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> ...Fine. If you don&#39;t have any money, some new inspiration will do.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Take me wherever you can, Fujimaru. France would be nice for now.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> What are you doing, Mash? You&#39;re coming, too. We&#39;ll end up dying if it&#39;s just me and Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> R-Right...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Whew. Is this place alright with you, Mr. Andersen?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Yes. Anywhere is okay as long as I can stay away from my desk. Let&#39;s enjoy the city of France first...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master, hostiles approaching! Looks like ghosts from the Hundred Years&#39; War manifested using the Grail&#39;s power.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Hmm. Soldiers from the past are reappearing? Interesting, why don&#39;t you play with them, Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> I&#39;m against physical labor but I will bear with it to get something to write about. Make this battle a good one, yeah?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Not bad. I never thought of this. But perhaps it was too late.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Mr. Andersen?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Fujimaru, Mash. Let&#39;s move on to the next location.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> You went on quite a rampage in Rome, correct? Then let&#39;s head to the Italian Peninsula, where my heart belongs!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I didn&#39;t do it by choice...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I thought you said you hate physical labor...</p><hr><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Skip the commentary, and you call yourself my editor? Let&#39;s go check the next observation object already!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Apparently, we&#39;ve pushed his buttons as a writer. Let&#39;s just accept it and keep him company.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> I found you! How do you do? Take that!</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> Ugh!</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> What&#39;s wrong with you people! Especially that kid there! His face has &quot;bad guy&quot; written all over it!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Wow, so aggressive! As expected of Roman Soldiers, their brains are always on vacation.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Mister, with all due respect. Anybody would get mad if a stranger suddenly threw a mud ball at their face.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> What? All I did was add fuel to the fire! Fujimaru, make sure you keep them alive this time, too!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> \u2014Well. Now that we&#39;ve finally ventured out into the ocean.</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong> Ohhhh, our prey is coming to us! Guys, this is a non-stop party!</p><p><strong>Pirate:</strong> Should we strip them? Or strangle them? Ridicule them? Whatever. Let&#39;s just kill them and let off some steam!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Are we surrounded?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> We&#39;re already in huge trouble?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, this is what happens when Andersen fixes the coordinates right on a pirate ship!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Hahaha. Sorry, I underestimated the pirates&#39; IQs. I had no idea how dumb they actually are.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> They aren&#39;t worth observing. I&#39;m going home. You guys go ahead and beat them up for me.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> They may be a memory of the sea, but they&#39;re still humans. Beat them to a pulp, and make them regret their actions.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You don&#39;t have to tell us! We&#39;ll do that! And you should reflect on your deeds for once, too!</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Gotcha. Oh, Mash, about the sequel to The Little Mermaid, can I base the Prince on those pirates?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Absolutely not!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Now I&#39;m satisfied. Good work, Fujimaru. I had an experience like no other thanks to you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...We&#39;re finally back. We had a rough time, huh, Master?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Aimlessly fighting through all those eras...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It was good combat experience for us, but why did you do it, Mr. Andersen?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> To observe people, of course. The weapons people of those eras used, how they fought.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Even primitive combat reflects human thought. The differences of all those eras will make a great reference.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Observe people... Then, you must love mankind. Right, Mr. Andersen?</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Huh? Don&#39;t be stupid! I&#39;ve no interest in mankind. I just needed data.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> Not only the soldiers, I learned something about you two as well. Maybe I will write it into a book someday.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Thank you for that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Being written about by one of the three greatest fairy tale authors, I&#39;m embarrassed just saying it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But I think it would be a great honor. Dr. Roman would get so jealous.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;ll pass.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yeah, you&#39;re right. Count me out, too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...You&#39;re a more thoughtful person than I imagined, Senpai...</p><hr><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> You two get along so well. You&#39;re so easygoing.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> I made a contract with you as a Servant because I had no choice, but now I&#39;ve changed my mind.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> It&#39;s hard to find partners for this crazy fieldwork, you know.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> I think I&#39;ll get a little more fired up from now on. A little. Very little. A tiny bit.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m glad I was able to help you write, Mr. Andersen.</p><p><strong>Andersen:</strong> ...Don&#39;t you understand that&#39;s a separate matter? This is why I hate my readers...</p>',106),a=[s];function i(h,g){return t(),n("div",null,a)}var d=e(r,[["render",i],["__file","Hans Christian Andersen.html.vue"]]);export{d as default};
