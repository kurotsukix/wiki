So much that you&#39;d be doing us a favor by helping us eat it.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou fou.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I&#39;m so sorry. I always seem to end up making enough to feed a whole family when it&#39;s my turn to cook.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I&#39;m sure it would be great if there were a large number of us camping out, but when it&#39;s only a few of us, I always feel like I&#39;m being careless and wasteful.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Hey, as far as I&#39;m concerned, the important thing is that your food is yummy.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Oh, well thank you, Master. I&#39;m glad to hear that. We cooks can always use more positive feedback.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I don&#39;t mind. It&#39;s like a decadent feast!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Well, that&#39;s kind of you to say, Master. ...That WAS a compliment, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> Hmm, this food is somehow...heartwarming. Is this what home cooking usually tastes like?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I&#39;m not sure. This is usually what meals were like back when I cooked for my own family...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> ...but I don&#39;t know if that alone qualifies it as home cooking.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Still, as long as the food is hot and nutritious, and everyone can relax and be themselves while they eat it, I think that&#39;s all you need.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> I see, I see.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> I ask because, as something of an older hero myself, I tend to forget what home cooking was like.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You do?</p><hr><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> I do.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> You see... (Munch) While my mother did raise me... (Munch, munch)</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Stop that! Didn&#39;t your mother teach you not to talk with your mouth full? A great hero should be setting a much better example!</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> ...Yes, you&#39;re right. My apologies.(Munch, munch)...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (Now he&#39;s savoring every bite...)</p><hr><p><strong>Martha:</strong> ...Well, that doesn&#39;t mean we need to eat in complete silence, either. I&#39;m happy to talk during meals, as long as we don&#39;t do so while chewing.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> Good point.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> ...My father, the great warrior Sigmund, died in battle when I was still a baby.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I see. I&#39;m sorry for your loss.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> Fortunately, I was not yet of fighting age, or he may have given me a baby battle instead of a baby bottle.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Bwa!?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Why would you say such a thing!? It doesn&#39;t even make sense!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Gah! Never mind! Let&#39;s just forget that last part!</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> Forgive me. Once I get a joke in my head, I simply cannot stop myself from saying it.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> Even my beloved has told me less is more when it comes to my attempts at humor.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> At any rate, after my father&#39;s death, my mother took a new husband, and a blacksmith friend of the family was entrusted with my care.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> And that was\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You mean Regin?</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> Indeed, I do.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> If you are familiar with my legend, that will save us time.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What was this blacksmith like?</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> His name was Regin, and he raised me as though I were his own son.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Was he strict?</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> Of course.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> He had to be, to ensure I would grow up to be a hero.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> Thus, I was trained to be a hero from a very young age.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I was taught swordsmanship. Spear handling. Archery. Axe theory.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I learned how to fight with every weapon under the sun, and still I hungered greedily for even more knowledge.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> My curriculum also included mandatory physical training.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> From sunrise to sunset, I would run nonstop across the plains without disturbing so much as a blade of grass.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I learned how to hunt beasts, and how to incapacitate people.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I mastered ways to defeat soldiers, warriors, and heroes, and how to fight on equal ground against those of more demonic natures.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> My training began practically the day I was born. As long as I can remember, I knew I was destined to become a hero, and had made my peace with it.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> But despite what you might think, I did not think of it as a burden...</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> ...No, on second thought, I suppose I did.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>The words were out of my mouth before I knew what I was saying.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I see... I don&#39;t blame you. I can only imagine how hard that must have been.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Though I am surprised to hear you say that, Sigurd. You always seemed like the type to keep those kinds of thoughts to yourself.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> True, I suppose I usually am. But in this case...</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> I thought that with my beloved elsewhere, and only a few comrades in arms I trust with my life here...</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> ...I could permit myself a moment of vulnerability and share how I truly feel.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Ahem! W-well go on, keep eating. The food&#39;s certainly not getting any warmer, after all.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You caught Martha completely off guard!</p><hr><p><strong>Martha:</strong> What did I just say!? ...Still, can you blame me?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I think anyone would be touched to be trusted so implicitly by someone from such a different time and place.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> Hahaha, I do apologize if I embarrassed you.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> At any rate, I can scarcely imagine how hard that kind of life must have been for you.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> But if nothing else, I can certainly pray for you.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Consider it a sign of respect for the conviction that helped you get through those hard times and become the hero you are today.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> You may well be right, Lady Martha.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> It was a difficult time in my life, to be sure...</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> ...but since I would not be here today had I not experienced it, I can look back on it fondly.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> That being said, if I were to encounter Regin now, I have no doubt I would punch him right in his face again.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou fou...</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> Indeed.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> While we are on the subject\u2013I would not normally tell you this next part, but since it is already part of my legend, I see no reason to refrain.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> Unfortunately, Regin deceived me. He planned to make off with the evil dragon&#39;s treasure after I slew it...</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> ...even if it meant killing me to get me out of his way.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh gosh. That&#39;s...terrible.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> Indeed. But by then, he was no match for me, and I quickly turned the tables on him.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I, uh, I see. You&#39;re very proud of that, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> Of course.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> I&#39;ve never thought of myself as a righteous hero...</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> ...but surely, anyone who could stoop so low as to stab a child he raised in the back must be irredeemably evil.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> So I think my killing him in retaliation must therefore have been a righteous act.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Yes, you do have a point. There certainly isn&#39;t much good to say about a man who would betray his charge for riches.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Do you hate Regin for what he did to you, Sigurd?</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> ......</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> No, I don&#39;t think so. I don&#39;t have much love for him now, but I wouldn&#39;t say I especially hate him either.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>No, I don&#39;t hate him. But it did pain me that things turned out how they did.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> If nothing else, I do owe him a debt of gratitude for his work raising me to be the hero I became.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> And above all, I would never have met my beloved had he not set me on that path.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> I suppose it just goes to show there is a thin line between good fortune and bad.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Don&#39;t you think you&#39;re being a little overly optimistic?</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> ......Now that you mention it...!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Oh come now! Surely there&#39;s no need to be that shocked about it!</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> It&#39;s just that I&#39;m usually so straitlaced that no one has ever called me optimistic before.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> I never even realized it until now... I see. So I&#39;m an optimist...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Arguably, one of the best parts of being a Servant is getting to better understand who we are even after we die.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Now that you know you&#39;re an optimist, you should work on polishing your optimistic nature.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> I see.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> From where I stand, it appears you are also an optimist, Lady Martha.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> For it is through your heart of iron wrapped in gentle mercy that you bring hope to people everywhere.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Oh?... Now that you mention it, I suppose I probably am an optimist.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> But that&#39;s okay. I think it&#39;s much better to be an incurable optimist than to bemoan the state of the world without doing anything to improve it.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> With that attitude, it is little wonder you became a saint. My mask\u2013er, hat is off to you.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> It&#39;s a little embarrassing, hearing you praise me like that...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Thank you once again for this meal, O Lord.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> At any rate, I&#39;m still wondering if there truly is an evil dragon in this Singularity.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> What do you make of it, Sieg?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> They&#39;re definitely the same species as me... Well, that might not be entirely accurate...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> But whatever species they are, I can definitely sense them here. Also, on a completely different subject, the stew is delicious, Martha.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Thank you, Sieg. I made sure to season your bowl extra strong.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I appreciate that.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> My tongue isn&#39;t as sensitive as humans&#39;, so I need strong flavors just to taste anything at all.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...Mmm, this really is delicious.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I&#39;m glad to hear that.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> All right, once you&#39;re done with dinner, we&#39;ll get back to searching. And this time, we&#39;re going to find those dragons and take care of them once and for all.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> And by take care of, I mean confront them and lay them to rest with mercy and prayer.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Lead the way, Ms. Iron Fist!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> How many times do I have to tell you!? I&#39;m a Rider! A Rider devoted solely to healing others!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> (Why is she upset? Does she not like being called \u201CMs.\u201D?)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> With a lineup like this, I don&#39;t see how we can lose.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> Indeed.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> Between two renowned dragon slayers like myself and Lady Martha, I almost feel sorry for our targets.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> All right then, shall we get going?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (I was kind of hoping for seconds...)</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Don&#39;t worry, Master. If you liked my stew that much, I&#39;d be happy to make another pot for you after we get back.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> Could I partake in this new pot of stew as well?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Well of course. Like I said, I always make too much anyway. When it comes to cooking for large groups, I daresay I could even give Cat a run for her money.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Let&#39;s do it!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Right.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I like to think I&#39;ve known for some time now how Siegfried fights...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...so I&#39;m really looking forward to fighting alongside you for the first time, Sigurd.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> I see. Well, since one of a hero&#39;s duties is to live up to young boys&#39; expectations for them...</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> ...I&#39;ll have to do my best to show off what I can do then.</p><hr><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I don&#39;t smile. I can&#39;t smile. I don&#39;t need to smile.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I don&#39;t get angry. I can&#39;t get angry. I don&#39;t need to get angry.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I don&#39;t get sad. I can&#39;t get sad. I don&#39;t need to get sad.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...Nor do I ever particularly wish for happiness.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The blacksmith who raised me said that was fine.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> He said I was a weapon, a blade, a guardian meant to protect those who can&#39;t protect themselves.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> He also said if I was going to be a hero, I shouldn&#39;t try to develop a personality of my own, as doing so would only end in tragedy one day.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Though his words stung, I couldn&#39;t deny that there was a hint of truth to them.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> If one were to assemble a group of one million people, ten thousand of them would no doubt be well above average.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Let&#39;s say that from those ten thousand, a hundred of the very best were chosen.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> That would mean that there were no fewer than a hundred people who excelled in every possible way\u2013mental, physical, and spiritual alike.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> And among those hundred... there is one truly exceptional being.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> They may be descended from gods...bring miracles to life...have wills like solid steel...or possess inhuman power.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Those beings are called heroes.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> They are birthed by the tides of history, and cultivated by the passions of their fellows.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I expect that I, too, am one of them.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> As long as this power of mine can be of use to the world, I have no qualms about materializing and wielding my sword.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> But...there is also something else. An itch that is somehow indescribably pleasant.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Something about it feels nearly dreamlike. It&#39;s almost as if\u2013</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong></p><h4 id="sigurd-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#sigurd-1" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Sigurd!</h4><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> What happened!? How could a warrior of your caliber become so distracted!?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Were you so nice and full from that delicious meal that you got sleepy or something?</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> No, nothing like that. Forgive me. I was simply a bit lost in thought.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Oh, thank goodness. I was worried you had been hit with some sort of mental attack.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Though in that case, I&#39;m impressed you can afford to get lost in thought while we face such a fearsome opponent.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> I&#39;m sorry.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> Rest assured, I will do everything I can to allay your concerns, starting right now.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> What are your orders, Master!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Hit it hard, and bring it down quickly.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> Understood. Then I would ask that you please send some more magical energy my way.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> Thank you, Master. All right, beast...have at you!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Martha, Sieg, I&#39;d like you to back Sigurd up.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Leave it to me. I&#39;ll make sure to heal every injury sustained, down to the slightest scratch.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I&#39;ll cover you with my Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> Then I&#39;ll lead the charge against this beast. Let&#39;s go!</p><hr><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> There we go. All the creatures have been destroyed, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Great work, team!</p><hr><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> Thank you.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Don&#39;t let your guard down just yet. We still haven&#39;t finished repairing this Singularity.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> And Sigurd, I think you still owe us an explanation for why you spaced out in the middle of battle.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> Yes, I suppose I do.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> Letting your mind wander in the heat of battle is inexcusable.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Still...</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> I got careless. I&#39;m sorry.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I-it&#39;s okay. These things happen.</p><hr><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I&#39;m surprised. I never thought I&#39;d see the day when you of all people slipped up.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I was kind of surprised, too...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> ...(Sigh) Fortunately, we were able to cover for your mistake this time, but we might not be so lucky next time.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Still, whatever&#39;s going on, if you believe you can figure it out on your own, please make sure you do so.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> I will. Don&#39;t worry. It won&#39;t happen again.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...?</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> Is something wrong?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Oh, no, it&#39;s nothing. Just my imagination.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> (Though for a moment there, it really did look to me like he was enjoying himself...)</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I&#39;m sensing more dragonkin a little further ahead.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Can you tell how many there are?</p><hr><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> There are lots of small ones, two medium-sized ones, and one big one.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Based on everything I&#39;ve sensed so far, I&#39;m guessing the small ones are wyverns, the medium ones are dragons...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...and the big one is a Fafnir.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> Then perhaps this Singularity will go away once we take care of them?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I think it probably will, yes. Though of course, that&#39;s easier said than done.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> These evil Fafnir dragons are always formidable foes I prefer to avoid, no matter how many times I&#39;ve faced them.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> Indeed.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Come to think of it, Siegfried says he doesn&#39;t remember anything about his own battle against Fafnir.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> He says even a single battle with stakes as high as those, where even one small mistake can lead to your death, is enough to drive a person to insanity...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> And since his went on for so long, he no longer has any recollection of how he managed to come out on top.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> It&#39;s true. That sort of thing is quite common in fiercely fought battles.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> While I also remember that I won my battle against Fafnir, I couldn&#39;t tell you how I did so.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> Much as I wish I could.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Well, I assume you at least used that sword against it.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> That much is certain, yes. Still...it&#39;s strange.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> I&#39;m still remembered as a heroic dragon slayer to this day, even though it&#39;s been a staggeringly long time since I accomplished that feat.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> ...But right now, I think I remember my ordinary life much more than I do that fearsome battle.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s a good thing or not.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Now you really aren&#39;t sounding like yourself. Of course it&#39;s a good thing, Sigurd. Of that, I have no doubt.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> I hope you&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> Maybe the same will be true for this journey to save humanity as well, and I&#39;ll remember the ordinary days far better than I will my battles.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m gonna go out on a limb and say that&#39;s probably a good thing.</p><hr><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> Do you think so, Master?</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> I see... That&#39;s very reassuring.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I might just be imagining things, but I&#39;m sensing there are even more creatures in the cave up ahead now than there were earlier.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> Well, that&#39;s not good. They must be birthing more to increase their numbers.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> That can&#39;t be right! How could they possibly grow up so fast!?</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> Anything is possible in a Singularity.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> They may be close to a powerful leyline, or they may have attained the power of a Holy Grail...</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> Either way, the sooner we eliminate the threat, the better.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Roger that!</p><hr><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Yikes! They&#39;re absolutely everywhere!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s just like what happened in Orleans.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We need to hurry, or they&#39;ll start reproducing faster than we can eradicate them!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> We&#39;re counting on you to help us tip the scales with the big one, Sigurd!</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> Consider it done!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We&#39;ll do our best to clear the way for you! Good luck, Sigurd!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Let&#39;s start by taking care of as many of the smaller ones as we can!</p><p><strong>Martha &amp; Sieg:</strong> Understood!</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> Indeed. We must do something about the dragonkin first and foremost!</p><hr><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> Now!</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> My demonic sword is complete; my ultimate technique is ready. The time of your demise is at hand!</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong></p><h4 id="bolverkr-gram" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#bolverkr-gram" aria-hidden="true">#</a> B\xF6lverkr Gram!!!</h4><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You did it!

Wonderful job, everyone.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> It shouldn&#39;t be long before this Singularity repairs itself now.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Fujimaru\u2013I mean, Master.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Shall we?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Hell yeah we shall.</p><hr><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> Oh?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Wooo.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Wooo!</p><hr><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> What was that?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> It&#39;s called a high five.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I&#39;m no expert, but apparently, it&#39;s some kind of ritual you do once a job is complete.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> Hmm.

This is nice.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Great work today, everyone.

They&#39;re supposed to protect others&#39; smiles.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I don&#39;t remember if Regin told me that, or if I said it myself...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> But either way, the environment I&#39;m in now is like nothing I could have imagined back when I was still alive.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> As a result, I think that, maybe...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...I may have grown a little weaker.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> ...So please, give it to me straight, Master.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> Do you think I&#39;ve gotten weaker?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> If this is you weak, I can&#39;t imagine what strong looks like.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s true.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We would have had a much more difficult time against Fafnir without your help.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> There you have it, Lord Sigurd. And I too can vouch that you are still as strong as ever.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Tell us, why would you think otherwise?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Not even a little.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Master is right.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> You are every bit as strong as you ever were.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Tell us, what in the world made you think otherwise?</p><hr><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> Well...</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> For one, the fact that I let my guard down on the battlefield.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> But more significantly, it is the fact that I was once able to defeat Fafnir on my own...</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> ...yet this time, I was unable to do so without assistance from other Servants.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> The only explanation I could think of was that...I must have grown weaker.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> True, there are definitely cases where we Servants are weaker now than when we were alive.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> For example, as a Saber, I can no longer use my Tarnkappe.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> In a vacuum, one could indeed conclude that we have grown weaker.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> I knew it...</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> However...</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> It might sound contradictory, but I&#39;m also certain I don&#39;t feel any weaker now than I did when I was alive.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> And the reason for that...is our Master.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> Well, [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her] and the other companions alongside whom we&#39;ve fought.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> While these kinds of circumstances would never come about during an ordinary Holy Grail War, they allow us to draw on this power.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> ...I see. Yes, you&#39;re right. Thank you, Lord Siegfried.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> How can I repay you for your help?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> If you&#39;d like to repay me, you can do so by sparring with a couple of people I know.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> Oh?</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> ...Hehehe.</p><p><strong>Siegfried:</strong> In fact, this sparring session might just help you truly understand what I mean.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> ...?</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> Good day. My name is Sigurd, and I&#39;ll be your sparring partner today.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> Hell yeah! Siegfried told me all aboutcha.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> This oughta get me another step closer ta bein&#39; a bona fide swordmaster!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I&#39;m a Caster, not a Saber...but I still tend to get involved in a lot of sword fights.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> So I think this sparring session will be extremely educational for me.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> ... ...Hehe.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> Somethin&#39; wrong, Sigurd?</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> Oh, sorry. Not to worry, everything is fine.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> Now, shall we get started?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m gonna fight on their side, &#39;kay?</p><hr><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> Understood.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> Then let us begin!</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> You&#39;re fast, but your strokes are all over the place!</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> It&#39;s natural to hesitate at times when using multiple weapons...</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> ...so your first step is to make choosing which one to use as natural as breathing!</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> G-gotcha!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> You&#39;re mine!</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> You&#39;re still overly reliant on Lord Siegfried&#39;s sheer strength.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> I can understand why you&#39;d be in a hurry to end the fight, since you can only transform for a moment\u2013</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> But there&#39;s no need to rush. You still have plenty of breathing room to use that technique.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> R-right!</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> Hraaaaaah!</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> Hmm.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> You&#39;re not hesitating, but that&#39;s made your attack patterns too simplistic.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> An effective combat strategy relies on a mixture of both truth and lies. I want you to come up with at least three options for attacking your opponent at any given time.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> Y-yikes! That sounds way too complicated for me!</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> If it helps, you could try thinking of these options as conditional reflexes.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> Perhaps you could try assigning numbers to each move. For example, four, seven, two, five...</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> ...could be something like that. Easy, right?</p><p><strong>Both:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I think we still have a long way to go before I can start thinking like that...</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> Oh? Hmm... Well, there&#39;s nothing wrong with associating them with something else, either.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> Yeah? In that case, do ya think I could try to think of &#39;em as paintins&#39;, Sigurd?</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> I&#39;m just startin&#39; ta get the faintest picture of how it could work here...</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> But I&#39;m definitely way more familiar with paintins&#39; than I am numbers.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> In that case, I&#39;ll try thinking of my techniques as Servant classes.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> That sounds fine to me.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> All right, Sieggy, whaddaya say we do this thing!? I&#39;ll go first!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> \u201CSieggy\u201D?</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Well, all right. But I&#39;ll be going right after you! Come on, let&#39;s do it!</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> That&#39;s it! Show me what you&#39;ve got!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Both:</strong> (Huff, huff, huff...)</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> There you go. Not bad at all.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> If you continue training regularly, it will only be a matter of time until you master the sword.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> Woohooo! We&#39;re finally done!</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> Aw damn, I&#39;m all outta juice. Don&#39;t think I can take another step.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I&#39;d offer to carry you, but I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ve hit my limit, too... I&#39;m sorry.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Those are the happiest exhausted faces I&#39;ve ever seen...</p><hr><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> All right, I suppose I&#39;ll just have to carry you both myself then.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> You know...that was a lot of fun.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> ...Hmm. That&#39;s not good.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> I shouldn&#39;t be thinking about having fun.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Why not? There&#39;s nothing wrong with enjoying yourself.</p><hr><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> ...Do you really think so?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> If you don&#39;t believe me,why don&#39;t you ask the person you trust more than anyone?</p><hr><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> ...Hmm.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Heroes are defined by fighting. By protecting the weak. By never smiling.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> That&#39;s why smiling would only weaken me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...At least, that&#39;s what I thought.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> I see. So that&#39;s what happened.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> What do you think of my weakness, my beloved?</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> Oh, my dear Sigurd. You haven&#39;t grown weak at all. You&#39;re still as heroic as you ever were.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> Just as you once learned how to smile kindly around me many years ago...</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> ...you&#39;ve now learned how to smile around many people.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> That&#39;s not a sign of weakness.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> It&#39;s a sign that you&#39;ve become more human\u2013 more like the person you were meant to be.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> And I think it&#39;s wonderful.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> I see...</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> Then I owe it all to you, my beloved Brynhild.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> If it had not been for the passion you inspired in me in life, or the loss I once grieved...</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> ...I would surely not be standing here before you now.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> Hehe. You never fail to make my heart beat faster.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> But that&#39;s just what I love about you... Honey.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> Urk. That, uh...certainly took me by surprise.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> You&#39;re always throwing me for a loop, so it&#39;s only fair that I return the favor now and then.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> Oooi! Oh, wait, that&#39;s my name. Hey, Siguuurd! We wanna train some more!</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> I just came up with a killer ultimate move, an&#39; I was hopin&#39; you&#39;d let me try it out on...Aah!</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> I&#39;m so sorry. We didn&#39;t mean to interrupt your alone time.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> See, Oei? I told you we should&#39;ve waited until morning.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> W-w-well how was I s&#39;posed ta know what ya meant!?</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> S-s-sorry for botherin&#39; ya, Sigurd. I&#39;ll come back tomorrow!</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> Don&#39;t be silly, Hokusai. This is a new ultimate move we&#39;re talking about, right?</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> I&#39;d love to see what you came up with.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> Beloved, would you mind lending them a hand?</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> Of course not, Sigurd.</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> Actually, um... Would you mind if one more person joined us? He&#39;s been telling us, quote:</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> \u201CI still have nooo idea why little old me became a Saber in the first place!\u201D</p><p><strong>Sieg:</strong> ...So I decided to bring him along, too.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Evening! Sorry to spoil your date! But I can&#39;t wait to have fun training with you!</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> Heh... Of course you&#39;re welcome to train with us.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> But whether you have fun or not is up to you.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> My swordsmanship class is ninety-nine-percent uncompromising, one-percent kind understanding.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Y-y-y-yikes! I-I&#39;ll do my best to keep up!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> My inner feelings may no longer be like a fiercely burning fire.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> They may now be more merciful, like the gentle rays of spring sunshine.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> But, even so...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...I can still sense it clearly, Sigurd the hero.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> ...Yes. Of course I do.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> This power stored within me...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...can reach explosive new heights thanks to its entanglements\u2013its relationships\u2013with those around me.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> We&#39;re waiting for you, Sigurd.</p><p><strong>Sigurd:</strong> ...Right. Then I suppose we&#39;d better get started.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I start by taking a single step forward, as I answer their call.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Formless and weightless though it may be, there is still energy to be found there\u2013a kind with a name all its own.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> We call it...\u201Clove.\u201D</p>',481),a=[s];function i(g,h){return o(),r("div",null,a)}var u=t(n,[["render",i],["__file","Sigurd.html.vue"]]);export{u as default};
