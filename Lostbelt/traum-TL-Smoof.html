Afterwards, Novum Chaldea was invaded by the Alien God. The Wandering Sea, which was our temporary residency, was lost. However, staff made an emergency escape. We redirected the gravitational collapse of the Wandering Sea back towards the Alien God named U-Olga Marie. Sion considers it effective based on the fact that she didn’t pursue any further, though her abilities and personality make it hard for Sion to draw logical conclusions. TRISMEGISTUS II was transferred over to the Storm Border along with Sheba Lens.

Johanna says that she has gained valuable information about Chaldea. She reports that the Servant was Sherlock Holmes and the Master was Kadoc Zemlupus. Constantine gives the impression that they are a two man team which makes him decide to put them off since they are not an immediate threat. Before Constantine leaves, he says to come by to the castle since her presence lifts the soldiers’ morale.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/tmuc9vo534491.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5da10e6deffedef237c6be5ac23d0fb87069406a" alt=""></p><p><strong>Johanna:</strong></p><p>…Shall I sing a hymn, I wonder.</p><p><strong>Constantine:</strong></p><p>Save that for another time.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/k7q4wrn434491.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07324f730fd7b7424eafb855b9deb9f6f83046ac" alt=""></p><p>—Constantine.

Roland and Astolfo were the two that they recruited and established a realm with, securing a balance between the other two Realms. The greatest flaw of this Realm was that Karl der Große was not Karl der Große, but Don Quixote and Sancho. Though it kept things sustainable for the time being. It was just a matter of time before subordinates had their doubts. The Servants that aided Guda were on the side of Pan-Human History.
