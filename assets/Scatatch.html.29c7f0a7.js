Looks like Fuyuki city... But I don&#39;t remember Rayshifting...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m having trouble remembering much of anything. I took some medicine and laid down...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But now I&#39;m in this form... I&#39;m armed as a Demi-Servant.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fofooou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Fou!? When did you get into the carrying space in my shield?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, kyaau?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I can&#39;t contact Chaldea&#39;s control room. So the doctor can&#39;t analyze our situation or bring us back.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> One possibility is... That this is a type of shared memory between the Servant and the Master... A type of dream.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Those flames are awfully hot for a dream.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, Senpai. I can feel the heat as if it&#39;s real.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This is the same Fuyuki city we traveled to with the director. But whether it&#39;s the same era, or if we&#39;re dreaming...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> There&#39;s so much fire but I don&#39;t feel the heat.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...? You don&#39;t feel the heat? Maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;m a Demi-Servant...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I may be different than you. ...That makes me a little sad.</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong> \u2014I see. So this is how you &quot;perceive&quot; this place.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I know your names already. Fujimaru, and the girl is Mash Kyrielight.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> You are inside a dream, sharing a memory of an intense experience you both had.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Perhaps I should say this is how the &quot;system&quot; works. Still, this is quite an interesting phenomenon.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Who are you?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Your magical energy... It does feel like a Servant&#39;s, but...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Something seems very different somehow...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You&#39;re not one of the Servants we saw in Fuyuki... Not only that, but I don&#39;t think</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> we&#39;ve ever met you before. I don&#39;t...think so, anyway. My memory&#39;s hazy...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I don&#39;t remember you.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Hmm. Of course not.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> It&#39;s been 2,000 years since I&#39;ve shown myself to anyone. We couldn&#39;t have met.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...If you said you had seen me, then we&#39;d have a bit of a problem.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> You&#39;re not an escapee from my realm, are you? You&#39;re not a ghost either, correct?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...We&#39;re not ghost-type monsters, no. But, you said 2,000 years, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That would be around the birth of Christ... Do you mean that&#39;s when you were alive?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...Hmm. So drawing a clear line to explain my existence, huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;ve seen that spear...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Hmm, I feel a passionate gaze upon me.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Oh, it&#39;s not me, but my spear you&#39;re looking at? It&#39;s good that you can assess weapons at your age.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> But this isn&#39;t what you are expecting. It&#39;s not a Divine Construct, forged by The Sea God, Manannan.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Sadly, it&#39;s just a spear. A stick, made from the skeleton of a sea creature.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...Or perhaps you were pretending to look at the spear, but were actually looking at me?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Heheh. You&#39;ve never met an Ulster woman, have you?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai, I know how you feel, but please restrain yourself for now.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s true that her proportions are... just about perfect, but...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Foou!</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong> Hmm. How should I put this? Thinking back, I haven&#39;t given many people my name.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> The warriors knew my name when they visited my home. The beasts and fallen gods challenged me out of fear.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> They all feared me because they knew who I was.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> It&#39;s been a long time since you\u2014no, people like you have asked me what my name is without prejudice.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> And so I have no choice but to answer honestly.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I am a being which exists outside the world.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Something which was to exist forever, without getting old or dying.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> My name is Sc\xE1thach, the ruler of D\xFAn Sc\xE1ith, the Land of Shadows. Although it does make me a little uncomfortable announcing it like that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> !!!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Kya\u2014u!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Sc\xE1thach! The god-killing superhuman who&#39;s said to practically be a divinity herself?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Is she amazing?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I see. Sc\xE1thach, huh...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, Senpai! She&#39;s mentioned in the Celtic myths of the first century, particularly the Ulster Cycle!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> An invincible warrior, the ruler of a supernatural realm similar to the underworld. She even trained the great hero C\xFA Chulainn!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> And she&#39;s also a &quot;great magus,&quot; one of the best ever... But she shouldn&#39;t &quot;exist in the Throne of Heroes,&quot; so why!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Doesn&#39;t exist in the Throne of Heroes?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You mean she can&#39;t be a Servant?</p><hr><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Oh, so the girl knew? You&#39;re correct, points for you. Hmm...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> You did talk a little too fast, three stars!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh? Oh, right. Thank you very much.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> It&#39;s all right. In your case, it&#39;s more effective to speak quietly. Keep it all within you, and be like a silent burning flame.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> ...Sorry, that&#39;s an old habit of mine. We don&#39;t have time for long chats.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> As Mash said, I was never meant to be here. Since I retired from the battlefields.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> I won&#39;t get into too much of why I&#39;ve been summoned, but\u2013</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> I&#39;ve shown myself for a good reason. To solve the problem occurring within this dream.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Master of Chaldea and you, new Servant, calm yourselves and open your eyes.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Witness what was brought forth by all the abnormality. Something is out of the ordinary here.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> AAAAAA...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> AAAAAAAA!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I saw them as soon as I sensed their magical energy! Enemy approaching, Senpai!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> If they&#39;re attacking we have to fight them.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Stay calm and be careful.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Right! Beginning combat!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Now this is worth traveling through the eras. An impressive response, and pleasantly high morale.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Hmm... I had decided myself to an easy retirement, but seeing you has made me change my mind.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Here we go...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Wah!? Sc\xE1thach!?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Yes, I&#39;ll be playing too, Mash. Fujimaru! Save me a seat!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> It&#39;s time for battle! First, fight. Fight before you think. Worrying comes after, as a privilege of the living.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> So fight, fight, fight, and win! That&#39;s the Celtic way!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Celts are crazy...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> R-Right... It&#39;s like violence is a necessity for them...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> YEAH!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai!?</p><hr><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Now that was an easy fight, I couldn&#39;t even remember what they looked like. I guess they weren&#39;t that tough, huh?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Now, tell me, Fujimaru. What did those enemies look like to you?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We&#39;ve fought them several times before... Did they look different to you, Sc\xE1thach?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> They looked like a smoky haze. To me, they seemed to barely exist.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> And that&#39;s because, not once have I perceived the idea of death.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fo-fou, fou?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Death?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Indeed. What you&#39;re seeing isn&#39;t memories of your past...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> ...Nor some kind of symbolism from your dreams.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Those are remnants left behind of a miserable death. They should not exist within you at all.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> To be more precise, they are the &quot;remnants left behind even by death.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> These flames you see. The ones you fought.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> They are the remnants left behind by the death you witnessed as you fought to protect humanity.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> There were many others around. Ten thousand or so moving corpses and skeletons.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> But I took care of all of them. They weren&#39;t worth teaching anything. They were far too weak.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> T-Ten thousand?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Hahaha, I&#39;m pleased that you&#39;re surprised, but you could&#39;ve just laughed it off, Mash.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> To a Celtic warrior, numbers mean nothing.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> We&#39;re all idiots who fight until we&#39;re dead, or there&#39;s no one left to fight!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...You mean death is attacking us?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> No, no, that&#39;s not it. That&#39;s not it at all.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I don&#39;t understand.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> That&#39;s fine. That&#39;s how you should be. You probably haven&#39;t grasp the concept of death yet.</p><hr><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> &quot;This place&quot; is overflowing with remnants &quot;abandoned&quot; by death.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This is a dream I&#39;m sharing with Senpai, right? So why would it be filled with something like that?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I don&#39;t think the Heroic Spirit I got my power from had the attribute to interfere with death...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> I&#39;m sure. A Heroic Spirit who brings death wouldn&#39;t suit you at all. This phenomenon is taking place inside you...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> ...But the causal factor is outside. It&#39;s a touch unfair, but, it can&#39;t be helped.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> That&#39;s what it means for all of human history to be incinerated.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> A normal extinction would cause death to overflow. Purgatory, underworld, anywhere souls can go would be overflowing.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> But this is different. Incineration of Humanity is a &quot;great deed&quot; that doesn&#39;t just burn away life, but death itself.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou... Fooooouuu...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A great deed...that burns away death?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Yes. Miracles that humans use are things like magecraft, rituals, sacraments, and curses.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> And then there are the &quot;Authorities&quot; the gods are said to possess. But the Incineration of Humanity doesn&#39;t belong to any of those.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Thus, it is a great deed. A human &quot;feat&quot; which surpasses even the &quot;gods.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> ...Though not even I am certain what that truly is.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> And so what you&#39;re seeing here are the remnants abandoned by death, the direct result after many eras being incinerated.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Then, some of them leaked into this place.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You don&#39;t... You don&#39;t mean inside Chaldea?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> That&#39;s correct, in a sense, but also not. Those remnants exist even closer than you imagined.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What do you mean?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Here. Put your hands up here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...My chest?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Indeed. But not those marshmallows. It&#39;s the warm &quot;heart&quot; that&#39;s pulsing inside of you with life.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> !!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> D-Do you mean... Those remnants have already been corrupting us!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s... What you mean, right? That&#39;s why I&#39;m suddenly with Senpai in these flames...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s okay. I don&#39;t think you have to worry.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It&#39;ll be fine. Let&#39;s go back to Chaldea together.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Yes, Senpai. You&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Hehe. I thought you&#39;d get scared, but you&#39;re holding on to hope. I can&#39;t believe how pure you are, but those purest are often the strongest.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Fujimaru&#39;s optimism and Mash&#39;s pessimism. I find both equally worthy.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Even after two thousand years, you humans haven&#39;t changed a bit. So fragile and ephemeral, but noble and beautiful.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> \u2014It&#39;s time to go. Follow me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> R-Right. ...No, wait. Where are we going?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> To destroy all the remnants that threatens to overwhelm you.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> As my Land of Shadows no longer exists, normally I wouldn&#39;t waste time on ghosts abandoned even by the wheel of reincarnation.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> But I do not think I can just let these things overflow.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> ...I know how frustrating it is to want to die, and not be able to.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> If the gods will not save them, I will. If they want a fight, I have no reason to refuse.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So this is the Celtic way!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Y-Yes, Senpai... This violent but dependable power is the Celtic way...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> YEAH!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai! Is the Celtic way getting to you?</p><hr><h2 id="spiral-rainbow" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#spiral-rainbow" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Spiral Rainbow</h2><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> ...That sure is an awful lot of fire, huh?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> I already know your names, Fujimaru, Mash. However...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> ...That doesn&#39;t mean I know everything about you. Nor the reason this city is on flames.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> What happened here? This is a place where you once walked, yes?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. Fuyuki City, in the far east. That first place we shifted to where a Holy Grail War was taking place.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The year was AD 2004. 13 years ago. It&#39;s very close to the present, but it&#39;s still part of the past.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This is where we...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Got caught up in a Holy Grail War that shouldn&#39;t exist.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, Senpai. We fought many Heroic Spirit for the fragment of the Grail.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Got saved by that Caster guy.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...That&#39;s right, Senpai. Without him, we would&#39;ve died.</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, kyau!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s right, Fou. He&#39;s the one who taught me how to pseudo-deploy the Noble Phantasm that was too much for me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Caster C\xFA Chulainn. I couldn&#39;t possibly thank him enough.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> ...Oh?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Oh. I see, I see. &quot;That&#39;s why&quot; it&#39;s me, huh? You knew him.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Mash, Fujimaru. I&#39;m sorry, can I ask a question?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Was he doing well &quot;at this place?&quot;</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh... Yes! He was doing very well. That&#39;s right! You&#39;re...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Sc\xE1thach, a warrior, a mentor to many heroes. You&#39;re the woman who trained C\xFA Chulainn!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I-I&#39;m sorry. I knew that in my head, but it&#39;s so hard for me to remember that the Caster who saved us...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...is the same C\xFA Chulainn who&#39;s part of the Ulster Cycle, and s-so...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Mash, calm down!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> R-R-R-R-Right, Senpai!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Foufou.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> YEAH!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> YEAH! ...Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I-I&#39;m sorry. I should&#39;ve realized sooner... He saved our lives.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I don&#39;t know what to say... Um... Y-Your student really helped us out.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We&#39;re alive today thanks to the spell he wielded when he materialized as a Druid.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> I see. No, there&#39;s no need to thank me.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> But nonetheless, as someone deeply related to him, I shall remember that. And someday, I will tell him.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> If I ever get the chance, that is. For now, you must first survive this place.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Otherwise, I&#39;ll have to tell him that I saw the children he saved...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> ...as they died. Now, survive! You must be strong!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> GAAAAAA!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That roar!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Sounds pretty big.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> A... Dragon?</p><hr><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> That is another remnant of death you witnessed... Or perhaps, will witness in the future.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Time means very little in this place. Just like the Throne of Heroes.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Either way, it&#39;s something that&#39;s been left behind. Now, overcome this trial, young ones!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, foou! Kyau!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> R-Right... You&#39;re right, Fou. I think that might be...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That might be a little too big! S-Senpai!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Sc\xE1thach!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Can you do something about that?</p><hr><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> ...I guess it would be cruel to make you do everything on your own. Come forth from my &quot;Gate,&quot; ye Spiral Rainbow.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> With the divine lightning in your hand, come forth, come forth and fight! Oh Guardian of Ulster.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> My body feels numb.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> My head feels numb.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> S-Senpai&#39;s magical circuits are being activated in a strange way!

Mages&#39; bodies certainly have changed...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> This innocent response is truly\u2014 Oh, no. Never mind. It&#39;s a temporary contract.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> I&#39;ll lend you a new power. Come forth, come forth and fight, Spiral Rainbow Sword!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Hahahaha! Finally it&#39;s time, huh? I&#39;m so glad it happened before I got bored and went to sleep!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> The young leader of the Ulster Red Branch Knights! Fergus mac R\xF3ich, at your service!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> I&#39;ve been waiting for this for a while now, Ms. Sc\xE1thach! Hahahahahaha! Damn, it sure is hot in here!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> ...Stop calling me that. When you say it, it makes me feel like a real elder.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Oh, yes. Right, right. Sorry. You&#39;re always young, Lady Sc\xE1thach.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Your heart is young, as are your skills! As sharp as when you were in your teens! But that&#39;s a different matter!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> I can&#39;t call the mentor I respect a little girl! That&#39;s not the Red Branch way! Sorry, Ms. Sc\xE1thach!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A very boisterous looking man has appeared! Senpai, the Celtic-ness of this place is going up quickly!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;re... Uncle Fergus!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> YEAH!</p><hr><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Indeed! Heh, we&#39;ve got some spirited new kids, huh?</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> I guess you&#39;re Ms. Sc\xE1thach&#39;s latest students. Let&#39;s see. A pretty looking girl and a [\u2642 boy /\u2640 girl]... She put her hands on you yet?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> I don&#39;t go after everything that moves, like you. I invite only the finest warriors to my bedchamber.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> They are the source of this dream. And hopefully, the ones who can someday lead us.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> I see! Oh dear, I&#39;m sorry. Hahaha! Then let&#39;s start with a drink! Have a drink with me!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Or let&#39;s do something else! If you need a drinking buddy though, I&#39;m your guy!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, uh. Huh! N-no, I&#39;m sorry, I\u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh? Senpai too?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So that&#39;s it, huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong></p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong> GAAAA!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Hey, it was hot a moment ago, but now it&#39;s even hotter! Also I see something big, and worth punching! Even better!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> So that&#39;s what I&#39;m here for, eh? You need the greatest swordsman the Ulster has!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Time for me to show off my blade! Ms. Sc\xE1thach, let me handle this!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Sword... What sword?</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Hahaha! What, you don&#39;t know my Noble Phantasm?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That drill can&#39;t be... It can&#39;t be...</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Hahaha! So you know my Noble Phantasm, huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Then behold my Rainbow Sword! Caladbolg, the sword that&#39;s both rainbows and lightning!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> If C\xFA Chulainn of the Red Branch Knights stabs his foes, then I, Fergus, tear them to shreds!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The mystic sword Caladbolg! A legendary sword, said to be the model of many other mystic and holy swords!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Heaven and Earth, spin, spin, spin! Watch in awe as I wield my immense strength!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Hmm... It looked like a famous dragon, but it didn&#39;t feel that strong.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Next time, I hope to fight one with the proper mind, body and skill!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> That&#39;s right, but do not let your guard down. Always face an enemy, even a weak one, with your full strength.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Hmm... Of course, I did not hold back. But are you telling me to fight until my flesh tears and bone breaks?</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Hahaha! As expected of Ms. Sc\xE1thach! Just how strict can you get?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> One of the heroes depicted in the Ulster Cycle, a great warrior of the Red Branch Knights, Fergus mac R\xF3ich...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um, Fergus. You&#39;re another one of C\xFA Chulainn&#39;s teachers, right?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Foufou.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Hmm? You mean S\xE9tanta? I did teach him to use a sword, but...</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Unfortunately, he wasn&#39;t much of a swordsman. He quickly switched to the spear.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> I trained with him and also looked after him. You can say he&#39;s almost like my own child.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> So, do you know him?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Right, it seems they fought together. In this ruined city ravaged by flames called Fuyuki.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Sounds like the Norse Ragnarok. That must be so much fun. I&#39;m jealous.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> One of his natural talents is having the luck to be blessed with the most terrifying battles.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> If I was there, I could&#39;ve challenged him to see who was the better warrior. What a shame.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> He was a druid.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> He was an amazing mage.</p><hr><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Oh right, now I remember. They say he was dressed as a druid.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> ...WHAT!? Was he being bullied?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Hahaha! Yes, that&#39;s the reaction I was looking for. Nothing really gets funnier than this.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, foufoou, kyuu?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um, thank you, Fergus. You helped us even though we summoned you without warning...</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Don&#39;t worry about it. This was just a temporary contract. Plus, I couldn&#39;t refuse Ms. Sc\xE1thach&#39;s summon.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> By the way, what kind of sorcery did you use, Ms. Sc\xE1thach? How was I summoned during my mealtime?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It is strange, yeah.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I don&#39;t think a Holy Grail or its fragment is here, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> You&#39;re right, a Holy Grail is not present. I tampered around with my Primordial Runes.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> I used myself as a catalyst, and stocked Heroic Spirits that I have relations to in this place.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Primordial... Runes?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Foou! Kyaau!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Yes. A true &quot;Primordial Rune.&quot; A type of Magical Crest lost in your modern era.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Modern mages have no way of knowing this, but the runes carved by the Great God of the Norse still exist in this world.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> The old runes made after that, and their modern recreations are not even close in comparison.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> I see, but I don&#39;t get it at all. Ms. Sc\xE1thach sure knows a lot! I wish one of us in Red Branch has even a fraction of that intellect.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Ancient magecraft can do that?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s more than ancient, you can say it&#39;s from the Age of Gods.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s amazing... Actually, it&#39;s really, really, amazing!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I guess that&#39;s Sc\xE1thach for you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yeah... She&#39;s using a rune from the Age of Gods, made by an actual god!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s unimaginable to us. If the Doctor was here he&#39;d be going crazy.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But this explains something I&#39;d been wondering about, Sc\xE1thach.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Hmm. And what&#39;s that?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I finally understand why C\xFA Chulainn was using runes. He learned how to use them from you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A Primordial Rune. An ultimate spell brought forth by the Great God of the Norse.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Oh, I know that look on your face, Mash Kyrielight. You were wondering why he didn&#39;t use Ulster spells, right?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Ogham letters don&#39;t work well. Runes take effect as soon as they&#39;re drawn, which makes them better for a warrior. That&#39;s all.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I-I see... I understand that the letters of the Celtic God Ogham...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...are hard to use unless you&#39;re a true druid. Your power isn&#39;t affected by its origin, is it?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> It&#39;s a matter of effectiveness. The Great God of the Norse is very kind to warriors.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Now, on to the next location. Are you ready to face the next remnant?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I am ready anytime.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, Senpai. I don&#39;t know how this happened, but I think I have an idea what we should do.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> YEAH!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Senpai, that was a very powerful response.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Are you trying to be a Celt? Are you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, foufoou! Kyaau!</p><h2 id="coming-from-ashes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#coming-from-ashes" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Coming from Ashes</h2><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Sigh... Talk about a disappointment.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> If this isn&#39;t a letdown, then what is? Yes, this is the prime place for a battle, yet still!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> I&#39;d also love to go find a nice lady, but with things in this state there aren&#39;t any around! No men, either.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Hah, lust is what makes a hero but you, you are on a completely different level.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Those bestial urges of yours might be the source of the power that makes you a hero.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Mash, did you know? This guy...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> H-Huh? What? Why are you involving me in this conversation, Sc\xE1thach?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> His lust is so strong that no human woman can be his wife.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> They all gave up after a few days, and in the end he married a forest goddess.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> That&#39;s right, a Divine Spirit. Gods&#39; appearances were rare to begin with in the Ulster Cycle...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> ...and one of those very rare appearances was made by his wife. He was too much to handle a goddess had to show up.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Y-Yeah... Um...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I don&#39;t...know...what to say... Um... S-Senpai...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s amazing, Fergus.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Hahaha! You&#39;ve got that right, if I do say so myself!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I don&#39;t know what to do either!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Foufou. Fou.</p><hr><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Whew... At this point I&#39;ll just have to risk my life and ask Ms. Sc\xE1thach.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh?</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> To tell you the truth, Mash, Fujimaru, I thought about asking you two...</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> ...but you&#39;re being guided by the Ms. Sc\xE1thach right now. You&#39;re basically kids, in a sense.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> I can&#39;t be going after kids. Which means, well, I&#39;ve got just one option. No, it&#39;s not one I was avoiding.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> As an Ulster man, it&#39;s my destiny to someday make the Lady of Shadows my own...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> I&#39;m ready whenever.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Oooh! How lucky am I!?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Foufoufou!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> If you want to receive a blow from my spear that can kill a god, then feel free. Come closer. Don&#39;t worry, I will treat you well.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Oh... Um... So... Well...</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> I-I guess there&#39;s no hurry on that one. First, we&#39;ve gotta get these kids to safety!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> And when that&#39;s done! I&#39;ll take you up on your offer!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> First, we fight! If I win, of course, you keep your promise. But if I lose, we&#39;ll talk then!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;re so bold, Fergus!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> YEAH!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> R-Right, Senpai. I think he&#39;s 100% serious. I don&#39;t know whether to be amazed or frightened...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Hehe. Dauntlessness, desire, vigor and lack of avarice. A hero must have all these things.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> They are what makes a hero an object of admiration. They are a symbol of glory and victory.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s what makes a hero?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Mash Kyrielight, don&#39;t look so confused. There&#39;s no need to force yourselves to mimic him.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> It is a virtue to reflect on oneself in the presence of the strong. There, there.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh... You&#39;re patting my head... R-Right...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Yes. Now it&#39;s your turn, Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (Get your head patted.)</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> ...Yes, good child. There, there.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (Dodge her head pats.)</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> ...What? Why are you so embarrassed?</p><hr><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Men can only become what they become. You cannot be anyone but yourself. Ever.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> ...Now, that&#39;s enough talking.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> [[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]!! [[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> T-This is an incredible amount of magical energy! It&#39;s absorbing all the mana in the surrounding area automatically?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s clearly viewing us as enemies!

This can&#39;t be...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Calm down, Mash.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It&#39;s not that different from the others.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Right, Senpai. I was panicking for a second. Now I&#39;m okay. I can fight!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Oh, I see. So that&#39;s your response? Do you fear it so much, Mash?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Yes. It scares me a lot.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m sure I&#39;m scared of any fighting... But I&#39;ll fight anyway. Because I need to.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Humph. Even if someday, the fight may take your life?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Of course. My fear and my life are two different things.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> And... I know something even scarier.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I already know how sad it is to do nothing, \u2014the desolation of leaving nothing behind.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> ...I see. So you&#39;ve already reached the deepest truth of life.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Then I&#39;ve nothing more to say.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> If you die here, you&#39;ll be ripped apart from the inside, and Chaldea will be filled with the remnants of death.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Humanity, civilization, everything you&#39;ve done, everything that exists will lose their last hope forever.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I know.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I figured that was the case.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Right, Senpai. I feel the same way!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, faau! Kyau!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Excellent! Glad to see you&#39;re ready to fight! Let&#39;s tear this thing apart then!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We defeated it! Good work, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fou! Kyau, kyauu!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> It wasn&#39;t a dragon, or a boar, or a giant snake... Humph. I&#39;ve never seen a monster pillar like that.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Hmm...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> It was beautiful in its own otherworldly way. It would serve as a support pillar for my castle in the Land of Shadows.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> But it&#39;s not something that should be praised too much. Besides, that&#39;s a really twisted way of naming something.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Sc\xE1thach, perhaps you already knew what that thing really was?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Once you become part of the shadow and abyss you can see the future to a certain degree, But no, I didn&#39;t know about it beforehand...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> I simply saw a fragment of the future related to it. The Incineration of Humanity.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> I&#39;m not that different than you. Though...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> I can see things like...this!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> ...You dodged it, huh? I see why they call you the Great King of Destruction.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> ...That was what I was going to say. What is that spear made of that my blade cannot destroy?</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> I am a destroyer. Of both old and new civilization.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> I will remove all traces of sentient beings from this planet. I will destroy all that stand in my way.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...You&#39;re!?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou! Kyuu, kyaau!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Is this another remnant of death?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> This is quite the creature we&#39;ve run into. Is the incineration of humanity capable of twisting things this far?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You know who she is, don&#39;t you? This Heroic spirit, whose magical energy rivals a dragon...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> More than you do. As the slayer of many gods, and bearer of the knowledge of the Land of Shadows...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> ...and as a being who&#39;s achieved eternity on the outside of the world, I know one thing...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> This would-be war machine is a little too dangerous to appear as a remnant of death!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> That&#39;s right. Indeed, Ms. Sc\xE1thach is just right! But, I do like slender bodies, though...</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> I can feel the core of my groin tighten when I look at her! She might be even a better woman than Ms. Sc\xE1thach!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Hahaha, but my intuition says what&#39;s inside her ain&#39;t quite what it looks like!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Go on ahead, Fujimaru, Mash!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> My Caladbolg is enough to delay the incarnated form of the King of Destruction!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Fergus!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> YEAH!</p><hr><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Don&#39;t worry. It&#39;s a question of compatibility.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> My guess is that if I break her first, she won&#39;t be able to use her full power!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Ms. Sc\xE1thach has the job of guiding you! So go!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Sorry, Fergus. I&#39;ll leave the rest to you.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> It&#39;s an honor! Until we meet again, friends! Now that fate&#39;s brought us together, I&#39;m sure we will!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Right!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, foouuu!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Good, they&#39;re gone. ...Well, next time we meet, they might be enemies.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> I&#39;m always on the side with the best girls, so I can&#39;t guarantee anything there.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Now, let&#39;s do this. Let&#39;s fight fair, square, and hard, so we&#39;ve got no regrets.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> For as stubborn as you are, though, you&#39;re awfully polite. I can&#39;t believe you let Fujimaru go.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> It&#39;s all the same. After I crush you, I&#39;ll destroy them too.</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> I destroy all that I see. That&#39;s what I was made for.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> You know, it&#39;ll be a hassle to break your body in that state.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> But you know! I&#39;m ready for it!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Whether it&#39;s coincidence, or inevitability I have no idea. It&#39;s probably a curse of the ancient gods...</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> But the true identity of my spiral sword, being a fragment of the distant, ancient gods is more than enough reason to kill you!</p><p><strong>Altera:</strong> ...Target, one. Initiate destruction.</p><h2 id="final-guidance" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#final-guidance" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Final Guidance</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Is Fergus okay, you think?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I can&#39;t detect his magical energy, maybe because of the fire. His temporary contract with Senpai appears to be broken.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, foouu... Fouu...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Uncle...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Fergus...</p><hr><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Don&#39;t make that face, Fujimaru.

Maybe you didn&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Still, this town&#39;s flame sure is burning bright.

This place must have left strong impressions of death on you.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> That&#39;s why there are so many remnants here that were abandoned even by death.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Exactly what you just said...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> This place will be overflowing with those remnants, and much sorrow and pain as well.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> So you&#39;re here. The last Heroic Spirit I prepared. The first spear of the glorious knights from the Fenian Cycle.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> My true name is Diarmuid Ua Duibhne. I&#39;ve been summoned as a Lancer for this temporary contract.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> I will fight with you for the last trial. Sc\xE1thach, shield maiden, and my temporary Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Diarmuid Ua Duibhne! A hero from the second age of Celtic myths, the Fenian Cycle.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> He brought glory to the Knights of Fianna along with the god-slaying hero, Fionn mac Cumhaill. Then...</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Uh...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Sorry. I should have kept my mouth shut.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What do you mean?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Did you say something bad?</p><hr><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> No. Fret not, shield maiden. The incidents in the legend were a result of my own disloyalty and lack of virtue.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> The hero&#39;s end was betrayal and death. A man of glory isn&#39;t guaranteed a happy ending.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> That goes for more than just Diarmuid. The greater the admiration for a hero...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> ...the more likely they are to meet a tragic end. &quot;I have no end,&quot; so it&#39;s not a concern for me.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Thinking back, yes... Not even S\xE9tanta&#39;s end was a happy one.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Sc\xE1thach...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> No, this is where you laugh, Mash. Celtic men leave behind nothing but tears and rage for their women.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> If you don&#39;t laugh, you&#39;ll end up hating them. Of course, that&#39;s not an absolute rule.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> It&#39;s true that I regret my end. That&#39;s why my lance can be of aid to you.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> Even if this is a temporary contract, a Master is no different than a liege lord.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Thank you, Diarmuid.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Let&#39;s fight together.</p><hr><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> ...What a pleasant response... There are no lies in your heart, are there?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> Then I, Diarmuid Ua Duibhne, shall become your spear with all my spirit!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Yes, yes. I figured you&#39;d get along. Diarmuid prefers Masters who are exactly what they seem to be.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> I&#39;ve raised so many warriors that I think I&#39;ve got a good eye for when people will get along.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;re like a goddess of relationships.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Well, I&#39;m nothing of the sort, but... I don&#39;t mind being told that.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Heh. That&#39;s an interesting idea, Fujimaru. Goddess of Relationships... I might think about that...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You&#39;re like an old matchmaking aunt.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> S-Senpai! N-N-No! That&#39;s so rude...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> N-No, I don&#39;t mean there&#39;s anything wrong with being an old matchmaking lady, but...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Hmm, I see, I see. You want to die. You want to die here, huh Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Mash&#39;s phrasing isn&#39;t too bad, though. Lady. That sounds elegant. I like it.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Well, the fact is, in human years I&#39;m over 2000 years old. It doesn&#39;t bother me that much, and I haven&#39;t had the chance anyway.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The chance?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Hehehe. Don&#39;t worry about it. Perhaps I&#39;ll tell you someday, but not now.</p><hr><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Now then. Enough fun. The last remnant approaches.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fooou! Kyuu!</p><p><strong>???:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I sense a Heroic Spirit, or no...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> The Heroic Spirit Orion. Or no, your true name is\u2014 one of the old gods of Mt. Olympus. Artemis, the moon goddess.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> But what gave you that form? Oh, I see. The tales of you falling in love with a human are true.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> That explains your human form, but...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, foouuu! Kyuu!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What&#39;s wrong, Fou?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> F-Fou is really excited!</p><hr><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Perhaps that beast understands. Yes. This avatar of the moon goddess is another remnant abandoned by death.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Its ferocity and savagery... Oh, it rivals that cursed boar!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> Yes, the ancient moon goddess had another side, a cruel one that would spread plagues, bring death, and drive men mad.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> The gods are not always a blessing to humanity. Sometimes, like this, they will bare their fangs just like mother nature.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> That&#39;s why we, the Knights of Fianna, were once needed in ancient Erin.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> To protect the people from demons. To protect them from the gods.</p><p><strong>???:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The ferocity...of a god... I feel an incredible animosity and urge to kill!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> I wonder if this remnant is from your past, or from your future.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Whichever it is, an avatar of a god is still a god!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Hahahaha! It&#39;s been so long since I&#39;ve killed a god! I&#39;m excited!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> I&#39;ll kill you, Artemis! It&#39;s disgusting that you would take a &quot;human form.&quot;</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Sc\xE1thach, you&#39;re really excited!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> It&#39;s been so, so long since I&#39;ve fought a Mediterranean god! I can&#39;t wait!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> YEAH!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> A splendid answer from the heart, Fujimaru!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...We&#39;re going to fight a god. A Divine Spirit. No, but it&#39;s an avatar.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s okay. Just calm down and do it like always.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Yes, I&#39;m fine.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Whether this is a dream, or reality, if I&#39;m with you I can fight!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Here it comes! Are you guys ready?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> ...Oh?</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Oh dear, oh dear... I feel like I&#39;ve been very mean to you.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> I&#39;m sorry. I didn&#39;t mean it. Even though Darling didn&#39;t tell me to, I...</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> ...It was only for one battle, but if I was of use to you, there is no greater joy.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> Shield maiden, temporary Master. Someday, beyond the end of time, we may meet.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong> Farewell. Sc\xE1thach... A million thanks for your compassion.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Thank you, Diarmuid Ua Duibhne.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Is this...the end?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, Senpai...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Sc\xE1thach said this was the last remnant. Which means we should be done?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Correct. You get a perfect score. Now, since that&#39;s done...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> This is as far as I go. The overflowing remnants have been removed from your hearts.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> So there&#39;s no need for me to force myself to stay in this realm.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Foou, fou...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Sc\xE1thach...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Even if you die, you will never become remnants.
