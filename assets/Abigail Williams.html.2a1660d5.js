Hello, Master.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> I&#39;m sorry. I guess I spaced out for a little bit.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> Is there something I can help you with? Eep!</p><p><strong>David:</strong> Hahahaha! Whether in a wasteland or a desert, some things never change!</p><p><strong>David:</strong> Only having two people around leads to price-fixing and exploitation, but with three, you have options and competition.</p><p><strong>David:</strong> In other words, that&#39;s when the gears of a real economy begin to turn!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (It&#39;s David and the Queen of Sheba.)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;ve been hearing a lot of noise. What&#39;s going on?</p><p><strong>David:</strong> Oh, hello, Master. Hello, Abby.</p><p><strong>David:</strong> The queen and I were just having a little chat. Turns out we have a lot to talk about.</p><hr><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Yes, yes, I know all that, and it&#39;s beside the point!</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> People were once pure, but they&#39;ve been consumed by the curse of gold ever since they left Eden.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Now they&#39;re divided into the haves and have-nots, and the animosity between them only continues to grow.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> It&#39;s not right. It shouldn&#39;t be like this. It shouldn&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> But as merchants, we can defuse envy with long-term loans, and pacify unquenchable greed with razor-thin margins.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Wouldn&#39;t you agree that&#39;s our duty\u2013nay, our responsibility?</p><p><strong>David:</strong> Hmm, I&#39;m not so sure about that, Your Majesty.</p><p><strong>David:</strong> I thought you were a queen first and a businesswoman second. Are you sure you&#39;re supposed to let yourself get so wrapped up in worldly affairs?</p><p><strong>David:</strong> You may have materialized in this century, but that still seems to go against everything you stand for.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Th-these things don&#39;t exist in a vacuum! My queenliness and my business acumen are inextricably tied together!</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> I can&#39;t just shrug it all off like some happy-go-lucky shepherd!</p><p><strong>David:</strong> Oh? Then do you have something in mind?</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Hehe... As a matter of fact, I do.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Chaldea may be a castle of might and Mystics, but it&#39;s not exactly flush with commercial endeavors or economic protections.</p><p><strong>David:</strong> Aha. I see where this is going.</p><p><strong>David:</strong> It&#39;s entirely possible that a figurative bucket of ice water could be dumped on Chaldea from an unforeseen direction.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Exactly!</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Lofty as Chaldea&#39;s ideals and goals may be, it is still a human organization!</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> So if we enterprising entrepreneurs all buckle down and work together, we could make wonderful things happen.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> For starters, we&#39;ll definitely need to bring in Caesar and ...</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Kid Gil could be a hard sell, but there&#39;s definitely a fire somewhere under all that smoke...</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> We could call it \u201CThe Chaldea Cartel.\u201D That rolls off the tongue nicely! Although, it might make us seem something less than honorable...</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Ooh, what about \u201CThe Chaldea Merchants Association\u201D then? That would be super \u201Cbene\u201D for a guild!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Hmm. You know, David, if you act now...</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> ...I miiight just be willing to offer you a seat on the board so you can save face with Master... (Glaaance)</p><p><strong>David:</strong> Gosh, you&#39;d really do that? I&#39;m flattered you think so highly of me.</p><p><strong>David:</strong> But, unfortunately, that&#39;s an offer I am afraid I must decline.</p><p><strong>David:</strong> That said...I was really moved by how hard you worked for Chaldea. It was like you cared for us as much as one of your precious jewels.</p><p><strong>David:</strong> I never expected to see a queen with your dignity work so hard. That made it all the more touching.</p><p><strong>David:</strong> I think even King Solomon would have had the hots for you after seeing that dual nature of yours. I know I certainly do!</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> T-touching? Hots...!?</p><p><strong>David:</strong> Man, all this talking&#39;s made me hungry.</p><p><strong>David:</strong> No, wait. It must be your sweet perfume that&#39;s whet my appetite.</p><p><strong>David:</strong> Anyway, I think I&#39;ll go help myself to some rugelach in the cafeteria.</p><p><strong>David:</strong> I hope you&#39;ll call on me again the next time you want to read poems or put on a lyre concert. See ya!</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> ...Da...</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Da... Da... Damn you, David!!!</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> I hope you fall off a camel and die!</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Who do you think you are, rejecting a once-in-a-lifetime offer made purely out of the goodness of my heart!?</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> You will rue the day you declined to get in on the ground floor of my ServaCoin cryptocurrency!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> ...Could I have a word with you, Queen of Sheba?</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> (Snaps out of it) ...Yes? What is it?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> Personally, I am all in favor of frank, heated exchanges. To engage in one is the sign of a close friendship.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> That said...I would urge you to control yourself better, especially in front of her. As you can see, she is rather distraught.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> It is quite an unpleasant sight to see two close friends at each other&#39;s throats, after all.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> Even if one is perfectly aware of each party&#39;s good intentions.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Ack...</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> I... Yes, he&#39;s right. I&#39;m sorry you had to see me behaving like that...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> Um... Please don&#39;t worry about it, Your Majesty.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> I appreciate you worrying about me, Geronimo, but I&#39;m fine. Really.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> ...I don&#39;t, um... Well, I don&#39;t really understand this business talk anyway...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> But just seeing you and King David here together is like a dream come true, Your Majesty.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> It&#39;s so wonderful being in your presence that I feel like I&#39;m walking on clouds!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> ...Oho. Perhaps my concerns were misplaced.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Phew... (Ears flop in relief)</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Thank you, Abigail. I promise I&#39;ll do my best to live up to your expectations.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> Teehee, please, just call me Abby. Silly Tituba. Ah...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> I&#39;m sorry. I should know that&#39;s not your name by now...</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Hehe, that&#39;s quite all right.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Tituba? As in your servant...?</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> ...Yes. That&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> She was my uncle&#39;s slave back in Salem...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> I wonder why I keep calling her by that name...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> She was nothing at all like the Queen of Sheba...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (...I think I&#39;ll just let that one slide.)</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> ...I&#39;m so embarrassed...</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Don&#39;t be. We Servants are intimately familiar with our past and our future. I&#39;ve even heard some of us keep our memories from before we&#39;re summoned.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> So...</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> I can understand why you might get me mixed up with someone else you used to know. Please, don&#39;t worry about it.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> ...Okay. Thank you, Your Majesty.</p><hr><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> ...Hmm.</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong> ...Abby. There. You are.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> Hello, Nezha. Good day, Gilles de Rais.</p><p><strong>Gilles de Rais:</strong> And a good day to you, Abigail Williams.</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong> There is. A tea party. The duchess. Said to. Invite you.</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong> Hm? Wait. Was she. A princess? A queen? Chaldea has. Too many. Nobles.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> Oh my...! Which queen do you mean?</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong> Hmm? You will. Find out. In the. Cafeteria.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> O-oh my. It&#39;s making me so nervous, getting a personal invitation...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> Do you mean the break room? Would you mind if I came along too?</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong> ...Not at. All. You are. Welcome. To join.</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong> You can. See. How good my. Oolong Tea. Is. For yourself.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Why don&#39;t you go with them, Sheba?</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> No, that&#39;s okay. I have a feeling a certain green-haired shepherd may be there, and I&#39;d rather not see his stupid face right now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Are you not going to the tea party yourself, Gilles?</p><p><strong>Gilles de Rais:</strong> No. I have business with you, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Gilles de Rais:</strong> Might I have a moment of your time? There is something I need to tell you.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Well that&#39;s a coincidence. There&#39;s actually something I need to tell you, too.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> ...No, on second thought, I don&#39;t think this is coincidence at all.</p><p><strong>Gilles de Rais:</strong> You don&#39;t say...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...There&#39;s an ominous star core headed this way?</p><p><strong>Gilles de Rais:</strong> Correct.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> So, you saw a sign of impending disaster...?</p><p><strong>Gilles de Rais:</strong> Indeed I did!</p><hr><p><strong>Gilles de Rais:</strong> Chaldea is a unique and blessed place...</p><p><strong>Gilles de Rais:</strong> Thanks to its cutting-edge optical instruments and interconnected network, it is possible to observe the stars in ways that were never before possible.</p><p><strong>Gilles de Rais:</strong> What&#39;s more, there are skilled technicians here who are deeply versed in the ways of magecraft.</p><p><strong>Gilles de Rais:</strong> ...And yet, there is harmony and discord among the stars that even they cannot see.</p><p><strong>Gilles de Rais:</strong> Even now, there is an almost imperceptibly slight disturbance in the relationship between Saturn and the sun, the two celestial bodies that are supposed to comprise Capricorn.</p><p><strong>Gilles de Rais:</strong> Of course, there is not enough wisdom in the world to perfectly predict the movements of the stars...</p><p><strong>Gilles de Rais:</strong> ...which is why I came to the conclusion that some sort of disturbance is making its way here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> And you had a prediction, Queen of Sheba?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Are you big on astronomy too, Your Majesty?</p><hr><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Is that so surprising?</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> I have the stars to thank for my own wisdom too, you know.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> After all, astrology originated with the people of the sea who first used the stars to navigate the great oceans...</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> ...and the people of the desert who crossed vast swathes of sand by night.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> I&#39;m sure today&#39;s scholars would rather pretend otherwise, but the fact is that economies have always been closely tied to the movements of the stars.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> ...I would have brought it up earlier, if we hadn&#39;t been interrupted...</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> ...but I was actually just about to mention this disturbance in the stars as well.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> I&#39;m heartened to see Gilles de Rais came to the same conclusion that I did.</p><p><strong>Gilles de Rais:</strong> ...I&#39;m afraid your agreement in this gives me no comfort. Indeed, it only strengthens my concern.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Oh... R-right, of course. I&#39;m sorry, I should really know better. Hehe.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Got it. I&#39;ll make sure to keep my eyes peeled.</p><p><strong>Gilles de Rais:</strong> Very well. I encourage you to act with the utmost caution...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;ll go tell Da Vinci to remain on the alert, too.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> ...Good idea. I think that would be for the best.</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Thanks for telling me about this, you two.</p><hr><p><strong>Gilles de Rais:</strong> ...Very well. That is all I wished to discuss.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Hey, can I talk to you about something?</p><hr><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> ...Me?</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> ...Ah, now I see. This is about Abigail.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong></p><p>Yes... I know she gets my name wrong sometimes.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> And that it has to do with her memories from when she was alive.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Though it does seem like she&#39;s been calling me by the wrong name more often lately.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What do you make of it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I can&#39;t help but worry a little.</p><hr><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Hmm...</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Like I told her earlier, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a cause for concern.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> She is surrounded by good friends looking out for her best interests here.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> To be perfectly honest, as one of Chaldea&#39;s Servants myself, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s my place to say anything.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Still...if it bothers you, I suppose there must be a good reason for that.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> In which case, as a mage, and as her contracted Master...</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> ...I believe it falls to you to step up and help her.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> If you&#39;re still not sure what to do after giving it your best effort, come talk to me again.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> That said, please don&#39;t forget about that disturbance with the stars over the last few days, either.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Good luck, and please be careful, Master...</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><pre><code>Chaldea \u2013 Midnight \u2013 Sleeping Hours

S-stay away from me!</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (Is that...really Abby?)</p><hr><p><strong>Villager:</strong> Shut up, you little brats! You shut your damn mouths! I&#39;d rather stuff sand in my ears than listen to another word!</p><p><strong>Villager:</strong> There&#39;s nothing more we can do. Nobody who went to the gallows is ever coming back!</p><p><strong>Villager:</strong> Don&#39;t remind us of that cursed time!</p><p><strong>Villager:</strong> That&#39;s right... We were dreaming. We were beset by a horrible nightmare.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> Haha...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> A dream? You think that was a dream? Is that some kind of joke?</p><p><strong>Villager:</strong> The verdicts were wrong! By the time we took it to trial, we were already defying God&#39;s will.</p><p><strong>Villager:</strong> Those who admitted to their crimes only did so under duress. The testimony we heard was false!</p><p><strong>Villager:</strong> There were never any witches here to begin with.</p><p><strong>Villager:</strong> It may take some time...but eventually, those who were punished unjustly will clear their names.</p><p><strong>Villager:</strong> In the end, this was yet another of God&#39;s tests...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> A test...?</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> Can you really call laying awake, shivering in the night, biting your tongue lest you become the next target, a test?</p><p><strong>Villager:</strong> Ghh...</p><p><strong>Villager:</strong> Even so, we must not forget our prayers. If we fail to give thanks to God, all is truly lost...</p><p><strong>Girls:</strong> Yeah. Yeah! We&#39;ll repent for our misdeeds, and this time, we&#39;ll\u2013</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> That sort of prayer is just you lying to yourself, trying to ease a guilty conscience.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> You were just pretending not to know the truth. You enjoyed it.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> You loved seeing things spiral out of control, like a snowball tumbling down a hill and growing ever larger.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> You were sick of the grown-ups bossing you around, and you wanted to twist them around your little fingers.</p><p><strong>Girl:</strong> Stop it... Please, stop it!</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> Be honest for once. None of you ever actually saw what I saw, you say?</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> The Devil&#39;s voice was the wind howling from the sea? Hell&#39;s shadows jumping from roof to roof were smoke?</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> Don&#39;t lie! The Devil WAS inside us back then!</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> ...I&#39;ll never forget it...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> I won&#39;t pretend it never happened. It wasn&#39;t just a dream.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> Even if I should be born again someday, I&#39;ll carry this sin with me forever.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Abby!</p><hr><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> Uncle is so depressed he won&#39;t even speak to me.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> Even Betty ignores me... She looks at me with such terror, like I am some kind of abomination...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> And Tituba...she&#39;s still stuck in that dark cell.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> They won&#39;t let me see her, no matter how I beg. They won&#39;t give me a chance to tell her how sorry I am.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> There...there isn&#39;t even anyone here who will speak my name...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> But...that&#39;s okay... Every time they pretend not to see me, they&#39;ll remember the truth.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> There were witches in Salem!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Abigail!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> ...Huh...?</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> Who are you...? Wait...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> ...Mas...ter...?</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> What... What am I doing back in Salem?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;re dreaming, Abby. You&#39;re just having a bad dream.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> A dream...?</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> I...I never wanted any of this to happen...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Whatever you did, Abby, it&#39;s all in the past now.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> You&#39;re saying it doesn&#39;t matter anymore...?</p><hr><p><strong>Girl:</strong> I hate you, Abigail Williams!</p><p><strong>Girl:</strong> I wish you&#39;d just get on a ship and disappear.</p><p><strong>Girls:</strong> Yeah! Yeah!</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> ...You don&#39;t have to tell me. I&#39;ll gladly be the first one to fall!</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> But even so...!</p><p><strong>Villager:</strong> Salem is just now picking up the pieces. We don&#39;t need a tainted child like you here!</p><p><strong>Villager:</strong> Forget it all! Just forget about it!</p><p><strong>Villager:</strong> Forget it!</p><p><strong>Villager:</strong> That&#39;s right. We should seal this cursed past away. We can&#39;t let the rest of the world know about it!</p><p><strong>Villager:</strong> Salem only barely survived this test God laid before us...</p><p><strong>Villager:</strong> Don&#39;t you dare sully the good names of those who gave their lives for it!</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> I never meant to...do that... ...No. No.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> You&#39;re wrong. There were witches here in Salem. You can&#39;t pretend there weren&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> I was born and raised in Salem. I&#39;ll never, ever forget what happened here...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> Not the bad...and not the good either...</p><p><strong>Villager:</strong> Why you little...! How dare you forget your piety, your fear of God!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> They all turned into ghouls!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> They&#39;re going after Abby!</p><hr><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> Oh, God... They&#39;re like the Devil himself!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;ve got to rescue her!</p><hr><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> ...Master...!</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> Please, don&#39;t fight... These people aren&#39;t strangers; I know all of them.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> They&#39;re my community, just like Chaldea is yours.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> They were all so kind. If it hadn&#39;t been for those trials...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Maybe so, but I can&#39;t let them hurt you.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> Ahh, Master... My heart feels...heavy...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> Master... You&#39;re a bad person.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> MothMephy!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> That&#39;s meee! Are you sure about this?</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> If you go about messing around with nightmares half-assed, they won&#39;t do what they&#39;re meant to!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Oh! Ooh! Bloodlust! Indignation! Pity! It seems your determination is fierce indeed, [\u2642 Sir /\u2640\uFE0F Lady} Mage.</p><hr><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Well then, if you&#39;re quite sure, shall we get started!?</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> As luck would have it, my darling little bombies have been positively itching for some action!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Haha, hahaha, heeehahahahahaha!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Villager:</strong> Hissssss!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> My, oh my, they just keep on coming, don&#39;t they? There doesn&#39;t seem to be any end to them.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> Oh, everyone... I understand...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> You want me to disappear entirely from your memories, don&#39;t you.</p><p><strong>Villager:</strong> LEAVE! BEGONE! GOD HAS FORSAKEN YOU!</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> None of them wants to admit that they enjoyed letting madness take hold of them...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> ...or that they let me fan the flames of everyone&#39;s insanity.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> Fine, then. I&#39;ll sink as low as I have to. I&#39;ll fall from grace forever and ever.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> Madness is nothing new to us, after all.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> Everyone has the urge to give their minds and bodies over to something bigger than themselves.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> It was always right there, just waiting for a chance! Anyone could have ended up like me!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s enough, Abigail!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You don&#39;t need to torture yourself anymore!</p><hr><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> I want you to carve this in your soul, so you never lose sight of it!</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> I am the witch of Salem!</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> ...Are you feeling all right, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...I&#39;m...back in my room...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Abby... I&#39;m sorry. Did I wake you?</p><hr><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> ...Are you okay? You were moaning in your sleep, and you&#39;re sweating.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> Here, I&#39;ll wipe off your forehead for you. You just stay right there, okay?</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> ...I&#39;m so sorry. It&#39;s all my fault. It wasn&#39;t supposed to be like this.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (Does this mean Abby wasn&#39;t the one dreaming...?)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (Mephy&#39;s not here... Though I guess that makes sense...)</p><hr><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> You&#39;re going to take a walk around Chaldea until you feel a little better?</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> Oooh... A midnight walk?</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> That sounds lovely. Could I come with you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (It&#39;s so quiet here again...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (It feels a little too quiet here. Almost like it&#39;s...deserted?)</p><hr><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> It&#39;s such a quiet night... Being up on a snowy mountain is really isolated, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> ...Master, would you...hold my hand? I don&#39;t want to trip in the dark.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> Hehe... Please don&#39;t worry. I won&#39;t depend on you THAT much.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You look like you&#39;re enjoying this, Abby. <strong>Abigail:</strong> Oh, I am! It would be such a waste to sleep on a night like this.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (It&#39;s like she&#39;s seeing Chaldea for the first time...)</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> Oh... You look sleepy, Hugo. Are you having trouble staying awake?</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> Try to wake up! The night is too much fun to waste sleeping.</p><hr><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> So that&#39;s the kitchen, huh... And...over there is the study?</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> So that&#39;s where the writers are making their stories even as we speak.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> I wonder what sort of play they&#39;re working on? It would probably bother them if I went to see, wouldn&#39;t it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (We&#39;ve gone all around Chaldea, and still haven&#39;t run into anyone.)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (Something strange is going on here...)</p><hr><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> Say...[\u2642 Mr. /\u2640\uFE0F Ms.} Ringmaster?</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> Do you think Mash is already asleep?</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> I know she&#39;s a very good girl, so I doubt she&#39;d be up so late...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> In fact...she&#39;d probably be upset if she found out we were staying up this late...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> ...Still...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> ...would it be okay...to stay together a little longer? Just the two of us?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> If that&#39;s what you want.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I think we can get away with that on a winter night.</p><hr><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> Thank you...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s good to see you again, Abby.</p><hr><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> ...You too, [\u2642 Mr. /\u2640\uFE0F Ms.} Ringmaster.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> I&#39;m glad to see you&#39;re doing so well.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;re the Abigail from that Salem, aren&#39;t you?</p><hr><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> ...Yes. I am.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What happened to Chaldea&#39;s Abigail?</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> ...She&#39;s asleep.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> I&#39;m more like a hazy shadow than anything else.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> I&#39;m so sorry the version of me here in Chaldea has had to have such awful dreams.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Is this still a dream?</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> ...What do you think, [\u2642 Mr. /\u2640\uFE0F Ms.} Ringmaster?</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> All I can say is, as long as I get to talk to you again, I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s reality or a dream.</p><hr><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> The truth is...I&#39;m actually somewhere veeeeeery far away right now.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> Someplace years...hundreds of light-years away...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> It was only because of one tiny chance, so many coincidences, and you thinking of me...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> ...that I&#39;m finally able to be here in Chaldea right now.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> My real self is still off on my journey...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> I can only be here for a short time at night, when the stars are aligned just right.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s a little overwhelming to see you again, but in a good way.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> Really...? Teehee.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> Then I guess it was worth sneaking away to come here when Uncle wasn&#39;t looking.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Well from now on, you&#39;re welcome to visit whenever you like.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> ...Thank you. I hope I can again...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (...She reminds me of a lost kid worried about finding her parents.)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (So, the two Abbys connected through their shared dreams...?)</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Have you been in touch with Lavinia at all?</p><hr><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> ...That&#39;s one reason I wanted to see you again, [\u2642 Mr. /\u2640\uFE0F Ms.} Ringmaster. I wanted to talk about her with someone else who knew her.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> And the only ones who still remember her...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> ...are you, Mash, and a few other of Chaldea&#39;s Servants.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> Ahh... This won&#39;t do at all...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> I thought, if I saw you again, I could put these feelings out of my mind...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> I thought that way, I could start putting one foot in front of the other again...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> But it looks like...I&#39;m a naughtier girl than I thought...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> [\u2642 Mr. /\u2640\uFE0F Ms.} Ringmaster...? Would you hold my hand...?</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> That&#39;s all I want...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> So please...would you do that for me...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (Gently take her outstretched hand in yours)</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> ...[\u2642 Mr. /\u2640\uFE0F Ms.} Ringmaster...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> Thank you... Thank you... You don&#39;t know how happy this makes me...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> You&#39;re such a good person that...I was sure you would refuse...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (Quietly shake head)</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> ...You won&#39;t...hold my hand? You won&#39;t even touch me?</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> Is that because...I&#39;m no longer the Abigail you know...?</p><hr><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> ...Ghh...! ...That hurts...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> ...I stripped the curse away before it could eat away at her any further.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> I only wish I could have done so without hurting you or Abigail, Master. Forgive me.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> Who are you...?</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> One of Chaldea&#39;s Servants... And by the looks of you...you must be one of the New World&#39;s native inhabitants...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> I am. My name is Geronimo. And you are a girl who has layered your soul upon Abigail&#39;s body.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> That inhibitor you are experiencing comes from an asabikeshiinh, also known as a dreamcatcher.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> It originates with the Ojibwe tribe, but I know how it works well enough to make my own in Chaldea&#39;s workshop.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> You laid this trap that far in advance...?</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> Right...of course you did. Chaldea does have more than its fair share of cunning tacticians.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> ...There&#39;s another one of you here?</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong> ...Abby.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> Nezha... ...You?</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong> ...Yes. Long time. No see. Abby.</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong> I had Geronimo. And. Gilles de Rais. Add me. To Master&#39;s. Security detail.</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong> Mash. And Mata Hari. Were also. Prepared for. The threat. From the stars.</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong> Geronimo and. I were. In charge. Of the. Gate of sleep.</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong> Indeed. This. Is a dream. My true body. And Geronimo&#39;s. Are still. In our beds.</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong> I greatly. Admire your. Trick in. Bridging your. World and. Chaldea&#39;s own. Through dreams.</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong> I applaud. How much. Your skills. Have grown!</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong> However! As Marshal. Of the Central Altar. I cannot. Let you pass. Beyond. My Fire-tipped spear!</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong> ...I wish. Our reunion. Could have. Been under. Different circumstances.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> Yes... This is hard for me, too...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> But I can&#39;t give up now... Tonight...is probably my last chance.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> [\u2642 Mr. /\u2640\uFE0F Ms.} Ringmaster will soon be leaving on another journey...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> A long, long journey to the rift between the cosmos and the void... Somewhere even I won&#39;t be able to reach...</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong> Abby. You are. My very. Best friend. So I. Cannot let. You get. Away with. This.</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong> If you. Insist on. Making this. Mistake. I will. Risk my life to. Cut you. Off. At the root!</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> ...Teehee. That&#39;s right. That is what you would do, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> I love you, Nezha.</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Oh, no. Abby and Nezha are getting ready to fight!</p><hr><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> Nezha is prepared to do what she must. Is that all right with you, friend?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> Do you wish to join the fray yourself?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Sometimes, the kindest thing you can do for someone is be harsh.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> ...Indeed. And it would seem now is one such time.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> Very well, if tough love is what is called for here, I shall do my best to help provide it.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> ...Though I know this treatment will be painful for you as well.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Be careful not to hurt Chaldea&#39;s Abigail.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> Easier said than done! That is an extremely difficult task, especially in this particular dreamspace.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> Still...I share your desire to see her safely returned to us.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> So I will see that it is so.</p><hr><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong> ...Abby! Stop this!</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> I won&#39;t let you escape... You&#39;re not going anywhere...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> The more you back me into a corner, the deeper into you my bonds sink, and the more they will ensnare you, [\u2642 Mr. /\u2640\uFE0F Ms.} Ringmaster.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> Soon, I shall pull you in towards me.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> Now...open, gate...</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong> Abby!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> Damn... She&#39;s brought in more foes!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> That takes care of all the monsters we can see...but now, Abigail is gone.</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong> She fled. Deeper into the base!</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong> I will pursue!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> What about them?</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong> I will not. Let. These ghouls. Have their way! I will wipe them out. Before. They run rampant!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> Wait. We must not let them overwhelm us. Remember, this is only a dream.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> We may both be fighting for control, but this other Abigail still holds most of the cards.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> These last battles have shown me that even the time we spend here is uncertain.</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong> That means. We should. Tell. The others. And call for. More help. Who shall. Return to. Reality?</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong> We can. Expect that. More ghouls. Await us.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Wait.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Please let me handle this by myself.</p><hr><p><strong>Nezha:</strong> ...What!? Master. Have you. Gone mad!?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> ...Can you tell us why?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I want to talk Abby down from this myself.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> We&#39;re not the only ones who&#39;re scrambling here.</p><hr><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...I think there&#39;s something Abby still needs.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Abby&#39;s not quite like other Servants.</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Sometimes, people get so distraught they don&#39;t know what to do.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Sometimes, people need help, but don&#39;t know how to ask for it.</p><hr><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> In other words...you think the Abigail from Salem...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> ...and the one here at Chaldea are still growing up, do you?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> ...You do have a point. I&#39;m sure it is no coincidence that she manifested here as the same sensitive girl she was during the chaos of the witch trials.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> Servant or not, this summoning karma is a cruel burden for anyone to bear.</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong> If you. Ask me. It is. A fall. From grace.</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong> Neither growth. Nor sublimation. But a fall. She is. Indulging in. Her own. Inner wickedness.</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong> As a. Foreigner class. She is. Very dangerous. She is. Attracted to. The evil. In the. Endless abyss.</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong> We need. To keep. An eye. On her. At all times to. Ensure she. Does not. Spiral. Out of control.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I think she&#39;s just lost right now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Blaming her for not doing the right thing isn&#39;t going to help right now.</p><hr><p><strong>Nezha:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> ...Now I understand, my friend. You will provide the weary traveler with shelter and respite.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s giving me too much credit.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I don&#39;t know about that, but I will do my best to cheer her up.</p><hr><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> ...Very well. If that is what you want, Master, I will not interfere.</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong> What!? So you. You mean. Both of. Us will. Leave Master. Alone in. This dream?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> If our goal is to have Abigail let her guard down, I think that it is a better option than for me to chase after her, weapon in hand.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong> Besides, I am not the one who saved her in Salem. That was you and Master, Nezha.</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong> ...Considering... Understood. I agree. Though reluctantly.</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong> But if. Something seems. Wrong in. Any way. I will. Return immediately.</p><p><strong>Nezha:</strong> Master. Take care. Of Abby.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I will. Tell everyone else thanks for me.</p><hr><p><strong>Geronimo &amp; Nezha:</strong> (Nod)</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (I&#39;m not hearing any more of those monster howls...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (It&#39;s so quiet now...)</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I can hear someone weeping...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...It&#39;s coming from the real Abby&#39;s room.</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (Quietly call her name through the door)</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...That&#39;s you, isn&#39;t it, Ringmaster...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...Please come in. You already have a key.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (Lean back on the door and wait) <strong>???:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Please come in. I promise I won&#39;t run away anymore...</p><hr><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> ... Ringmaster...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> It... It wasn&#39;t...supposed to be like this...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> I never wanted to hurt Nezha, or any of your other friends...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> I&#39;m s-so sorry... But don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll disappear soon...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> ...Please...let me stay? Just...just until the celestial gate closes?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (Sit on the edge of the bed where she&#39;s curled up)</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> ...I&#39;m so embarrassed at how childish I&#39;ve been acting.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> I wanted to greet you again as a proper lady...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> I&#39;m so ashamed... I don&#39;t know how I&#39;ll ever be able to face Mash, or Uncle...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (Offer her pancakes)</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> ...O-oh my. These look wonderful.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> They&#39;re more like pastries then a meal.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> I envy the version of me at Chaldea if she gets to eat these regularly.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> Thank you for remembering how much I like pancakes, Ringmaster...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> But I&#39;ll pass on them for now. I don&#39;t need to spoil myself any more than I already have...</p><hr><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> I...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> I wish I could see Lavinia again. I miss her so much...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> I want to hear her voice again... To sit side by side in front of a campfire, looking up at the stars...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> But...I can&#39;t ever make that happen again...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> No matter how many doors I open, I can never go back to that place I remember so fondly.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> ...Uncle did tell me there was a way there.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> But...he also said that if I&#39;m truly going to see Lavinia Whateley again, it would probably happen at a time when I&#39;m no longer me anymore...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> That, more than just wielding the silver key&#39;s power...I would be like the guardian deity for the gate of time and space.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (Sounds like an even higher dimension of travel than Rayshifting...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (Sounds like she&#39;d be capable of changing history at that point...)</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Are you enjoying your journey?</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> ...Yes, I am.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> Even you might be surprised by how many adventures we&#39;ve had, and how many amazing things I&#39;ve seen.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I guess your uncle&#39;s not gonna be too happy about this, is he?</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> ...No, he&#39;s not.</p><hr><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> Right now...my real body is in a huge, ancient library on a distant planet.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> It&#39;s got lots of books about all sorts of stars. It has enough about the old Earth to fill an entire wall.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> Lavinia would have loved it there. She always did love to read.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> Um...is the version of me in Chaldea being...helpful?</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> I hope she&#39;s not...making life harder for you...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> She&#39;s just as capable as any other Chaldean now.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> Really...?</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> Then she was able to become a proper Servant? She must have worked so hard.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> Then, um...could you maybe praise her...even just once every month or so...?</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> I-if you praised her every day, she&#39;d get so overcome she&#39;d just pass out.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> She was a little unsure of herself, but she adjusted in no time.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> Is that so...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> That makes me so happy. I&#39;m sure she has you and Mash to thank for it.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> Along with...um...was it Geronimo? I should apologize to him, too...</p><hr><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> And...has she made any friends? No, wait...I can tell.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> I can feel the trust that all of your companions place in her radiating through this Spirit Origin I, uh, borrowed.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> It wouldn&#39;t even be possible for me to be here talking to you like this without permission from the version of me here in Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> I&#39;m so sorry...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> I&#39;ve definitely overstayed any welcome I might have had. I&#39;d better be on my way.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> Besides, I need to give you back to everyone who&#39;s worried about you. Along with this body, of course.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> ... Ringmaster...?</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> ...Are you okay?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...There&#39;s someone I miss, too.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;d do anything to see the person I miss again.</p><hr><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> ...Yeah.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> But...I&#39;m the last Master of Chaldea.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> When I do see them, I want to be able to hold my head high...</p><hr><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> ...Yeah.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> ... Ringmaster?</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> ...It&#39;s okay to cry.</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> It&#39;s always okay to cry. If you need a shoulder...I&#39;d be happy to lend you mine...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> That should help you feel a little less lonely. So...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> ...You know, Ringmaster...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> ...I wish I could have called you \u201CMaster,\u201D even just once...</p><p><strong>Abigail:</strong> Farewell...
