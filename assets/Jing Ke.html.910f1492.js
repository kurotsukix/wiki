Good timing. There is a thing I want to ask you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Sure, what&#39;s going on?</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> I want you to train with me. I want a simulated battle, but its setting is a little complicated.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> Roman taught me how, and I memorized it... But, I have a bad feeling.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> My intuition never fails in this kind of situation. I&#39;m sure I will kill, no, I will break that device.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I-I see. That&#39;s one fantastic intuition. And, it&#39;s good you talked to us about it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Let me take care of fine-tuning the settings. You can always count on me.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> Oh, I appreciate it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So, how do you want it?</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> Defeat the king, this is what I want to train.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Understood. I suppose a situation similar to the one you were once in is all right?</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> Of course! That&#39;s the way it should be.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Then, the simulated battle will start now.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> As you already know, I failed to assassinate the first emperor.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> Nevertheless, I&#39;m really thankful of Master for summoning me and letting me serve.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> But, I can&#39;t just relax like this. I must succeed, even if only virtually.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> To slay with this dagger, I&#39;m still a little far.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> So, I will go one step closer.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> ...Of course. Soldiers rushed to his rescue.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> Only unarmed civil servants were around the first emperor, but I can&#39;t expect such a good situation every time.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> Then, let&#39;s start slaying them. As fast as possible. From now on speed is everything.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> And move another step forward. If there is a mage, he will summon something to protect the king.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> Let&#39;s see. A tough, defensive golem would be perfect.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> I must slay it instantly, too. Polish up the dagger&#39;s edge even more\u2013!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> And, it&#39;s almost over. Now, the only remaining prey is the king.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> ...I made a mistake here. I misjudged the emperor to be an immobile, corrupted man.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> He was tyrannical, but at the same time, he was great. I should&#39;ve considered he could move and confront me.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> He knocked down my flying dagger, and ran away quickly while I was slightly shocked.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> Yes, this is the end. I will take the king&#39;s head\u2013let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> ...Yes, this is the end. This is checkmate for the king.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> Of course, in this case I&#39;d perish too, but that can&#39;t be helped. Though virtual, I think it&#39;s good enough.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> After all, this is nothing more than a fabrication. The fact remains that I failed to assassinate the first emperor.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> But if I sacrifice my body, certainly I will be of some use to you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I don&#39;t want you to die.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Don&#39;t waste your life.</p><hr><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> ...Ah, you&#39;re right. I will gratefully accept your kindness.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> But unfortunately, this is the only way I know how to fight. And this is the reason I was summoned.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> You must use me. And when I vanish completely, lament for me.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> Your tears are my everything.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> That way, I would be able to think that my sacrifice had served a purpose.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> ...Don&#39;t worry. That doesn&#39;t mean it will happen.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> Until then, I&#39;ll enjoy this world with drink in hand.</p>',50),i=[r];function a(g,h){return e(),n("div",null,i)}var l=t(o,[["render",a],["__file","Jing Ke.html.vue"]]);export{l as default};
