Time to get off.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Okay Doctor, please check the communications system.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It looks fine. I can&#39;t believe we&#39;re looking for Captain Kidd&#39;s treasure! How exciting!</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> Do you feel in your element, Dr. Roman?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Well, my name is Romani Archaman. &quot;Roman&quot; for short.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Adventures like looking for pirate treasures are part of what makes humans &quot;romantic.&quot;</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Just before Kidd was caught, he told a fellow pirate the whereabouts of his treasure.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> But he was a pirate, you know? Stories you hear from a drunk aren&#39;t all that trustworthy.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> So nobody ever found where Captain Kidd&#39;s treasure lay.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> How do you know where it is, Mary?</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Oh, I found out later the treasure I previously gave up on belonged to Captain Kidd.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You gave up on it?</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> By chance, I ended up on this island a little before I became a pirate.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Since I was here, I decided to look around\u2013 and I found the treasure.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> ...Yeah, I think it was treasure. I only saw it from a distance.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> At a distance? You didn&#39;t get close?</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> ...There was a reason I couldn&#39;t, you see. Okay\u2013Let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> Hehehe, I&#39;m looking forward to this.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Um, first we have to get through this forest, I think...</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> Oh my, oh my. \u2013There&#39;s something here.</p><p><strong>Pirate?:</strong> Gweh... Money... Ladies... Treasure...</p><p><strong>Pirate?:</strong> Gweh... Meat... Ale... Treasure...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I guess even pirate zombies are still pirates, huh...</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Some things never change. Now let&#39;s send them on their way to heaven.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> Amen!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> There we go. Hmm... Hey, Master.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> I feel a little bad for them... Is it okay if I bury them?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Sure.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Of course.</p><hr><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Thank you, Master.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> You&#39;re very kind. Come on, Mary. I&#39;ll help.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;ll help too.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Okay.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> \u2013If I may...</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> May the saints of heaven preserve them, may the dominions welcome them, may their souls be taken up to heaven\u2013</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> Take pity upon us, and save our souls. ...Amen.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Thank you. Sorry for taking so long. Most pirates end up thrown into the sea.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> I thought it might be nice to actually have someone pray on their behalf for once.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Let&#39;s keep going!</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Past these wilds is a cave at the bottom of the mountain. That&#39;s where the treasure is.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> I&#39;m amazed no one found it if it&#39;s that easy. Those pirates came so close.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Hmm, well it&#39;s probably\u2013</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Because of things like that wandering around.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> Hehe, Mary. You need to tell us stuff like that ahead of time.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Yeah, sorry.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> P-Preparing for combat!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Whew. We got them. What&#39;s a chimera doing on an island like this?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Those zombies back there acted a little strange too...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um, Master...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I have a bad feeling.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I really want to run.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Me too, yes. Doctor? Doctor?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...Zzz... ...Treasure...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Doctor Roman is asleep. When we get back, we should punish him.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Okay, we&#39;re here!</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Good, looks like no one&#39;s been here but me.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> So no one&#39;s touched it? That&#39;s great.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um, so Mary. Why didn&#39;t you take the treasure?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Even if there was too much to carry, you could&#39;ve at least stuffed some jewels in a bag...</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Oh, well you see... \u201CHe\u201D wouldn&#39;t let me.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> He? Who?</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Um... I think we&#39;ll see him any minute now... Oh, there he is.</p><p><strong>Captain Kidd:</strong> Curse ye... Curse ye all...</p><p><strong>Captain Kidd:</strong> None can have me treasure... It&#39;s mine... It&#39;s Captain Kidd&#39;s treasure...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> C-Captain Kidd...! That&#39;s a ghost, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> That&#39;s right. He was here, so I gave up.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> In life, I had no way to fight a ghost.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Though thinking back, maybe I should&#39;ve brought a silver sword, or a cross, or some holy water...</p><p><strong>Captain Kidd:</strong> No one can have me treasure... It&#39;s all mine... Not yours...</p><p><strong>Captain Kidd:</strong> None can have!</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Hi, I&#39;m a pirate. I&#39;ve come to take your treasure.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> I&#39;m also a pirate. That treasure&#39;s just rotting away here.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> So, old man, give it to me\u266A</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I&#39;m very sorry, but that treasure is of no use to you now.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We&#39;re going to take it back and use it to help the living, the era, the world.</p><p><strong>Captain Kidd:</strong> Curse...ye! NONE CAN HAVE ME TREASURE!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Captain Kidd:</strong> Oooooh... Impossible! M-Me treasure... Me treasure!</p><p><strong>Captain Kidd:</strong> I-I-I! Damn it... Oh, damn it all!</p><p><strong>Captain Kidd:</strong> That&#39;s right! I&#39;m dead! I guess I&#39;ve got no choice... But I hate it!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Whew... That was a hard fight.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Whew! Finally! Treasure time!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Y-Yeah! This is a little exciting.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Um... The ghost was over here, so... Found it! Look at all these chests!</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Opening!</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> It&#39;d be something if after all this, the punch line is &quot;Try Again&quot; or &quot;Your experience en route was your treasure.&quot;</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> ...If that happens we&#39;ll bring his ghost back and torture him.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Okay... I&#39;m opening it up.</p><p><strong>All:</strong> ...Hooray!</p><h2 id="treasure-of-the-knights-templar" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#treasure-of-the-knights-templar" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Treasure of the Knights Templar!</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong> More treasure?</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Yup. But it&#39;s not pirate treasure. It&#39;s the treasure of the Knights Templar.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, you mean the treasure that was hidden when the Templars were executed as heretics.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Pirates are definitely exciting! This time around, I promise to fully monitor you guys!</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> I hope so. Mary, I&#39;m amazed you knew about the Templars&#39; treasure.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Remember how we went to all sorts of places during our pirating years?</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> Oh yes. When we got to port, you would always go out exploring.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> It was hard for you, Anne, because men would always follow you around even just walking down the street.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> Aww, you&#39;re so mean.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Hehehe. Um, Doctor.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Yeah, what is it?</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> I know most of what there is to know about the Templars, but I&#39;ll let you explain.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> It&#39;s too much of a hassle.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Yay! She shoved all the tedious work to me! Oh, well That&#39;s what a back-end support job is about.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The Knights Templar were a group formed by clergymen to protect pilgrims traveling through the Holy Land.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> One of their missions was to guard the treasures of knights and believers on pilgrimages.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> As more pilgrims and crusaders started going to the Holy Land, the Templars gained more wealth to guard.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> They ultimately functioned as a bank, including loaning money. They were even entrusted with an entire nation&#39;s fortune.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> But the Kingdom of France, heavily in debt, captured and tortured many of them.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> France wanted to get rid of their debts and take the money.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Even though they canceled out their debts, a majority of the fortune France sought disappeared into the shadows.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The Templars are even said to have possessed a Holy Grail, but everything&#39;s been shrouded in mystery.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> I heard the story from an old man who said he was a descendant of one of the Templars.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um, can we trust him?</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> I&#39;m not sure. He was drunk, and he kept switching between yelling and crying.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> But the story itself seemed sensible. From what he said...</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> The Templars had heard from their spies that their lives were in danger.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> So they loaded their treasure on a ship and hid it somewhere. Everyone involved in the transport was killed on the spot.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Their plan was to hide the treasure until the Templars could rebuild themselves.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> The old man&#39;s ancestor left the Templars so he wouldn&#39;t be caught. Even the Templars didn&#39;t know where he hid.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> But the Templars never recovered. His ancestors continued to pass down the word to wait for the Templars&#39; reformation.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> After about four centuries, they stopped caring. He sold me the story for a drink...</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> Sounds pretty sketchy to me.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Right. Sorry if it doesn&#39;t pan out.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> No problem.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It&#39;ll be fine since it&#39;ll be fun.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> That&#39;s right. It&#39;s getting to the treasure that&#39;s the fun part. There isn&#39;t much we could do with the treasure as we are now, anyway.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> But it can boost our QP, and maybe we&#39;ll find something interesting! Let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> The old man said it was back here. But this is just a stone wall.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> Was our lead a dud?</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Sorry...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s too early to say.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Don&#39;t give up.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No, wait a second. There&#39;s a tiny bloodstain on this wall.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Oh, you&#39;re right. Same with the others... I wonder why?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Doctor, please investigate the wall in front of us.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Roger. Investigating now. Hmm... I&#39;m detecting a strong magical energy reading from the wall.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Anne, try blasting it with your gun.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> You&#39;re a Servant now. Your bullet should get some response.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> Understood. Here I go!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The wall started to move. These are... Golems!?</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Woah. Come to think of it, I heard something about the Templars using black magic...</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> Was there such a tale? Well, let&#39;s just beat these guys.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The golems are all down, but I&#39;m seeing more enemy responses up ahead.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Proceed with caution.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Sure thing, Doctor.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This makes me think the old man&#39;s story might be true. Let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Whew! This side&#39;s clear, too.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> Security&#39;s tight. I&#39;m getting excited.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> We probably won&#39;t find a Grail.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Maybe we will.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That is to say, I don&#39;t mean the Holy Grails we recover. I mean the true Holy Grail of legend.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> That would be an adventure indeed. Master, do you want the Holy Grail?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I want a future.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I want peace.</p><hr><p><strong>Mary:</strong> I see. You aren&#39;t very greedy. Or maybe you are.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> The future or peace... Those are really big wishes, so you probably don&#39;t have time to be thinking about smaller wishes.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> As the guy paying for everyone&#39;s salary, that would be great. That aside, I&#39;m picking up some life-form signals. Be careful!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Doctor, a fair salary is an absolute necessity to keep talented people around. Let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Whew. Homunculi and zombies. Were the zombies people killed by the Templars?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> If that is true, they must have been there a long time. Let&#39;s pray their souls find rest.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> We&#39;re almost to the end. The treasure should be there!</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> Wow...</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Ah...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This is...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Treasure!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Mounds of riches!</p><hr><p><strong>Mary:</strong> We did it, Master!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> H-Hold it! Hold it! I-In that cave, I&#39;m picking up a life-form signal that we have all become very familiar with!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Some say the Templars used black magic, others that they didn&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Maybe they were, maybe they weren&#39;t. I&#39;m sure there are tons of stories like that.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> But would you normally go to these lengths?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> A dragon!? Um... I can only say...well... F-Fight!!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> We won. Victory!</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> Whew! I&#39;m exhausted. I can&#39;t wait to take a bath.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s pretty standard for a dragon to guard treasure, but I didn&#39;t expect the Templars to use one.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> They&#39;re less like Templars and more like Temp-LATES, am I right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Fou, when we get back, bite Dr. Roman on the nose. As hard as you can.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fourururu!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I-I&#39;m sorry! I thought that was a good one!</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Anyway, this is a huge pile of treasure, Master. Yeah, I like it.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> There&#39;s enough money here to easily buy a country or two. Any Grails?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Nope, I&#39;m not picking up anything. But I do see magical energy here and there in the treasure.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Can you search for me?</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Hmm, maybe it&#39;s this?This crystal skull.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> A crystal skull! That&#39;s a rare treasure indeed!</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> What about... this? It&#39;s a set of weapons and armor.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Probably used by the Templars. Magically it&#39;s nothing special, but it&#39;s valuable as a treasure.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> The right thing to do would be to return these to the Templars&#39; followers, but we&#39;re pirates, so we&#39;ll just keep it, thank you very much.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> Hehehe, this is also for saving the world.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Yup! Let&#39;s make good use of this to save the world. Right, Master?</p>',216),a=[s];function g(p,h){return e(),r("div",null,a)}var u=t(n,[["render",g],["__file","Anne Bonny and Mary Read.html.vue"]]);export{u as default};
