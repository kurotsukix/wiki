Oh hey, Fujimaru. Are you by chance looking for the Queen of Sheba?</p><p><strong>David:</strong> Actually, in the hallway a few minutes ago...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You ran into her?</p><hr><p><strong>David:</strong> ...I did not. Hahaha!</p><p><strong>David:</strong> I had some business with her myself. She&#39;s the Queen of Sheba, after all.</p><p><strong>David:</strong> She&#39;s the queen whose beauty was praised and noted in any number of texts and works of art. Even the Bible!</p><p><strong>David:</strong> And now that beauty has come to Chaldea. I always meant to introduce myself to her!</p><p><strong>David:</strong> I would start off with a brisk \u201Chello\u201D and a pleasant conversation starter. Then, I would lock eyes with her and seal the deal by taking her hand.</p><p><strong>David:</strong> You have to meet a person to know if you&#39;re compatible with them, you know.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> So you&#39;re looking for someone to abi-shag...</p><hr><p><strong>David:</strong> Hey, I&#39;m passionate about this! It&#39;s very important to me!</p><p><strong>David:</strong> With the help of a certain someone here (a fellow fan of bronze skin and fuzzy ears), I&#39;ve done a bit of sleuthing.</p><p><strong>David:</strong> First, I checked when the Queen appears in common areas. Then I looked into her favorite facilities and how she likes to get to them...</p><p><strong>David:</strong> But not once have I managed to meet her. Hrmmm...</p><p><strong>David:</strong> I try to get a few steps ahead, but she always seems to see just what I&#39;m planning, and so manages to evade me. I have only failed so far!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s impossible.</p><p><strong>David:</strong> I&#39;m not exaggerating. It&#39;s all true.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;ll just go report you for stalking...</p><p><strong>David:</strong> Oh, no. I wouldn&#39;t recommend that, Master. I&#39;ll have you know that I&#39;m always innocent. My good looks always help me beat the rap.</p><p><strong>David:</strong> But, should the security personnel be male, he may falsely accuse me out of sheer jealousy. How sad.</p><p><strong>David:</strong> Besides, I&#39;m only acting on instinct. As a sheep herder, I&#39;m inclined to gather any lost sheep\u2013</p><p><strong>David:</strong> Okay, fine! It&#39;s my fault! Just put your phone away!</p><p><strong>David:</strong> ...But honestly. Big as this place is, failing to run into someone at least once seems odd...</p><hr><p><strong>David:</strong> Maybe it&#39;s because...she&#39;s using her power of looking into the future or something...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Maybe it&#39;s annoying enough that going so far is all she can do...</p><hr><p><strong>David:</strong> You think it&#39;s annoying? But this handsome guy is so desperate!</p><p><strong>David:</strong> I know my actions can be problematic, but don&#39;t you think it&#39;s funny when you think about it? That fact I, for once, am failing?</p><p><strong>David:</strong> Don&#39;t you think that&#39;s a sight to behold? Oh, I hope the Queen of Sheba thinks so too.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> King David&#39;s optimism scares me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I wouldn&#39;t say anything if you weren&#39;t out of line.</p><hr><p><strong>David:</strong> Thanks for that uninspiring word of encouragement, Master. I&#39;ll just have to patiently wait for my encounter like a gentleman.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So...we&#39;re back at the Command Room.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Da Vinci asked me to search for her...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Eh!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Where am I!? Why is there suddenly a desert!?</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong> Meowhahaha!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Well, well...you fell right into my mousetrap, agent of the villainous universal genius!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> There&#39;s no use squirming to get out! Not so much as a rat is gonna escape on my watch!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> You&#39;ll get a punch! A kick! A body slam! Come at me! I&#39;ve got moves like a jaguar!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Eh!? Eh? Jaguar Warrior!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> But you&#39;re not even from the desert...</p><hr><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Ha! Everyone knows cats and the desert go together like peanut butter and jelly!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> And now, the winds of South America will blow CATastrophically in this desert! What I mean is, you&#39;re gonna die!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Ack!!! Ptttfttt! Sand! It&#39;s rough and coarse and getting everywhere! And drying out my famous toe beans!</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> U-um...Jaguar?</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> I&#39;m sorry to interrupt, but I believe Master has some business with me...</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Oh, I see... I understand. Except I don&#39;t! The only thing I know is that there are butts that need kicking for entering my territory!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> I thought I made myself clear, lovely animal-eared girl! I can only remember and follow one command at a time!</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> P-please wait! (Sigh)... I guess we have no choice.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> I&#39;m sorry to ask this since you only just arrived, Master.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> But would you mind giving me a hand in calming her down? I will repay you generously.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Anything for my Queen!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Understood. I&#39;ll look forward to your reward.</p><hr><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Oh gods! Oh gods! Have you forsaken me, Babylonia&#39;s\u2013</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> ...Babylo-lo!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...We&#39;re back in the Command Room!?</p><hr><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Ack...im...pawssible... So all this was just a desert meowrage...</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Hahaha...it was a short-lived dream...the real me probably is asleep at a cat cafe...</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Whew...have you calmed down, Jaguar?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Yep, I&#39;m awake, and I&#39;m feline fine. Hm. I don&#39;t even know what a Babylonia god whatsit is...</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Wow. Amazing. (Clap, clap)</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> That was an amazing illusion. So potent. It felt so real.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> I could even feel the burning heat of the desert sun, and it was making me thirsty.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> I&#39;m sure that skill came in handy in protecting the kingdom of Sheba.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Kid Gil...don&#39;t embarrass me... That illusion wasn&#39;t the one I wanted to use...</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Some of Chaldea&#39;s magecraft equipment on the fritz, right? It happens all the time, don&#39;t worry about it.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> That&#39;s a relief. That means there won&#39;t be any lawsuits... Anyway, this is bad!</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> I really didn&#39;t intend for Master to get caught up in this!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Kid Gil&#39;s here too? What&#39;s going on?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Does this have to do with Da Vinci calling everyone over?</p><hr><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Oh, my... Oh, my...</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Da Vinci was looking for me? I-I didn&#39;t even notice.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> I&#39;m sorry. Kid Gil and I were having a business meeting\u2013I-I mean, we were in deep conversation, so I didn&#39;t realize...</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> And I asked Jaguar to stand guard and make sure no one disturbed us.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Yep. I accepted the task for an hourly rate of three tangerines. One to save for later, one for sketching, and one to freeze.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Very suspicious...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Are you hiding something?</p><hr><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Ehhh!? N-no! Nothing...nothing at all!</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Oh, does it look suspicious?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> I suppose it does. I guess Da Vinci does have the upper hand.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Oh, right. So Da Vinci was\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Eh!? Tons of lost manuscripts unearthed!? THE Leonardo da Vinci&#39;s manuscripts!?</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> And she&#39;s trying to figure out how to handle them!?</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Well then just give them to me so I can auction them off! I&#39;ve got this!</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> We can even leave my handling fee open for negotiation. I&#39;ve already opened up some back channels and\u2013Oh.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> \u201COh\u201D?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> \u201CBack channels\u201D?</p><hr><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Ah...um...well... Oh, my... Oh, my...</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Hm? What&#39;s wrong, my animal-eared amigo?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> You just made this really devilish face that reminds me of another friend of mine.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I get it now.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> What do you mean, you get it now!? Explain, please.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Okay. So you all know that my treasury is...you know...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I see. Can&#39;t authorize that.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Ehhhhhh!? Nooo, Master!</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Yes, exactly. It&#39;s widely known that my treasury is...you know...</p><hr><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Of course, I do have a fine collection of weapons and armor as well, but not only that, I also possess a vast number of ornaments and rare metals.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> But to keep them all locked up is such a waste...</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> ...That, at least, would be the modern take on it...and since we&#39;ve had knowledge of modern norms granted to us, that is the conclusion that we came to.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> That&#39;s why...I&#39;ve suggested Kid Gil try some investment ventures to fund a side business...</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> It will serve as collateral to finance art exhibits for people to appreciate and admire. Growth industries where we can put his fortune to work for him!</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> She has a great eye for appraisal... This arrangement would be beneficial for me as well.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> My treasury gets a bit more organized, and I get a chance to add some more modern treasures to it as well.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I still don&#39;t get why you brought Jaguar Warrior into this...</p><hr><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Actually...you see...</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> I (discretely) approached some of the more...veteran Servants who have more experience in this modern world, seeking their cooperation...</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Meow?</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> U-um...do you have a moment? There is something I would like to discuss with you...</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Well! If it isn&#39;t the great queen of the southern desert nation!</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> You cannot imagine how excited I was to learn that you were summoned to Chaldea!</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> How reassuring! Ah, how holy! You, an individual full of knowledge and divinity!</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Together, we shall become the sword and shield of Chaldea and lead it down the path of righteousness!</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Uh...s-sure... P-pleased to meet you...</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Um...well...thank you for your time...</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Excuse me...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Oh, my! It is the Queen of Sheba! I am honored! Please, allow me to shake your hand!</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> ...S-sure... Ooooucch! My bones! My poor hand!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> You are the living embodiment of a miracle! Faith will surely take hold in this land now!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Should you need any help at all, please do not hesitate to ask me!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> The fastest way to get a six-pack, the best bulking recipes...please leave all of that to me!</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Um...okay... If I ended up needing that...I guess... Really...sorry for your trouble...</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Tarasque...is so cute...I wish I had one... (Sob)...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> ...?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> They are all great and reliable people, who hold the Queen of Sheba in the highest esteem...</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> But they weren&#39;t the right personnel for THIS job...haha...</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Heh. So you&#39;re looking for the right connections and market? It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t know a few...</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> But all my sources deal in shady and dangerous addictive substances... Like gourmet candy.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So this is a business venture to earn you some spending money?</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Well, then I know the perfect person.</p><hr><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> WHAT!?!?!? It&#39;s not who I think it is, is it?</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Are you perchance thinking of an individual whose name starts with \u201CD\u201D? Specifically, a king whose name starts with \u201CD\u201D?</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Impossible!</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> He&#39;s basically my chief business rival! A competitor!</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Were I to team up with him, it would ruin my profit margins!</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Oh, and don&#39;t forget that when the business takes off, I&#39;ll be taking my cut, too.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> I&#39;ll invest as much as you need until then, of course.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Ack.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Something&#39;s bothering me...from a legal standpoint. Let me guess...</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Sheba and Kiddy Gil...are you guys trying to get into some kinda shady business together?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Is this going to affect Chaldea&#39;s peaceful snack time situation?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> I don&#39;t want to see Fujimaru and Mash with the expression of someone who&#39;s used up all their materials and embers.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Not in my Chaldea. I&#39;d rather die than to have us eat only apple cores for every meal.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Th-things would never come to that...p-probably...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> She&#39;s suddenly not so confident.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> I AM confident!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Wasn&#39;t your future sight going to get you a pile of money?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> For one thing, if she did anything THAT flashy, nobody would want to do business with her.</p><hr><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Master, are you trying to get in the way of my side business? I&#39;ll have you know, I am not giving up on this endeavor!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Not at first, I wasn&#39;t.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I kinda feel like I should stop this, yeah.</p><hr><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Hm! I agree with Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Time to boycat this plan! Losing out on three tangerines is tough, but it&#39;s gotta be done!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Start the simulator! Start the battle BGM!</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Oh? This is...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> A 3D image?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> A simulation?</p><hr><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Meowhahahaha!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Behold the high-techiness of My Room instantly turning into a small-scale simulator room!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> It was so worth getting help from an anonymous member of Chaldea (a fan of fuzzy ears and big sister types)!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Can&#39;t put anything past that half-god, half-human feline!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Heh. A couple squeezes of my toe beans, and she was all mine!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> How much did this renovation cost?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Don&#39;t ask about cost! You&#39;ll ruin our P&amp;L!</p><hr><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> ...If brute force is what would make you listen...</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Then maybe it wouldn&#39;t be so bad to let my fists do the talking to introduce this plan to Master!</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Oh, wow. Looks like both parties are really fired up.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Oh well, I guess I did get on this ride! I&#39;ll just have to do my share for our business.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Shall we get down to it, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> His eyes aren&#39;t smiling...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> He&#39;s LITERALLY going to use body language, huh?</p><hr><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Meowhahahaha!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> We won! Chaldea&#39;s snack time is made safe at the paws of your faithful Jag\u2013</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Meow?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Excuse me for interrupting your...uh, deep discussion.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> I received a report that the jaguar who&#39;s been looting our pantry is here.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> Eh!? Oh crap!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> H-hey! Lemme go! Don&#39;t just lift me up by the scruff of my neck like that!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> ...A-air...can&#39;t...breathe...</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> I got her. Target secured.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Sorry to cause trouble. I&#39;ll take my leave now.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong> ...! Mrrroooooow!!!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> (Pat)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Da Vinci...did you come to check things out?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Is this...a note?</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (Is she telling me I need to deal with this?)</p><hr><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Why did you want all that money, Queen?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;m sure we could give you an allowance that will let you could live comfortably here...</p><hr><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Ah, yes. We did not get an explanation of why she wanted to start up a business in the first place.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Not that I much care.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;re always so rational about things like this, Kid Gil.</p><hr><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Yes... That has been said before.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> But this is about her, not me.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> B-because...</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> C...camels...!</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> I want pet camels!</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> In Chaldea! I want to keep camels in Chaldea!</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> But...after I researched a few things, it sounded...so difficult...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Camels? How many?</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> At least...maybe one hundred... A-and I&#39;m not kidding!</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> If there was only one, it&#39;d get lonely!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Well, yeah, this isn&#39;t an environment camels thrive in...</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Why is Chaldea in a place like this!?</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Let&#39;s move to the desert! The desert!</p><hr><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Ahaha...a full-scale camel zoo in Chaldea, huh?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Yeah, a few million dollars wouldn&#39;t be enough for that.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> The cost to build such a facility, plus yearly maintenance...it&#39;d be upwards of three hundred mil!</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> After all, we&#39;re in such an isolated location that we might as well be trying to terraform Mars or something.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> So...it&#39;s impossible...isn&#39;t it? (Sob)... Camel...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Oh...this is?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Another illusion? Or a mirage?</p><hr><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Oh? This is different than the usual simulator projection.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Actually, according to Da Vinci...</p><hr><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Oh?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> The Near-Future Observation Lens: Sheba keeps starting up because it synchronizes with the Queen of Sheba&#39;s mental state?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> And not just that, but it&#39;s affecting the other machines too, causing a bunch of problems?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> I see.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> I suppose I should expect as much from something Lev Lainur created...</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> But, that&#39;s strange.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> With so many Servants gathered here in Chaldea, why did this happen now?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Oh...I see...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> We need to take care of the Queen&#39;s homesickness!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...By the way, about my reward...</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> ...Oh...okay...</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Would an assorted camel-shaped cookie box suffice? They&#39;re all broken, though.</p><hr><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Camel... (Droopy ears)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Queen of Sheba!</p><hr><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> What is it, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I will take you to the desert!</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> ...You&#39;re not pulling my leg, are you?</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Then...make sure you always bring me along when you go on a quest to the desert!</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> And even if it isn&#39;t a quest, just take me whenever I ask you, okay?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I will be your camel!</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> ...Really?</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Promise? I want one with one hump, okay?</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> If you have two humps, I&#39;ll tan your skin and make you into a wallet.</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Okay!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> As you wish, my Queen.</p><hr><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Heehee...</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Teehee...heehee! Okay!</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> I&#39;m feeling a bit better... Sorry to worry you all so much.</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> That&#39;s great. By the way, Queen of Sheba...</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> If you would like to tamp down this \u201Cpower\u201D of yours, I think I can offer some advice.</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> ...!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Does that mean...</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Yes. It&#39;s a side effect of her future sight.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> This was all caused by indiscriminate use of future sight?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Yes. It appears so.</p><hr><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> I see...</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Got it. I&#39;ll allow Kid Gil to help me once more.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Please help.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Try to keep the mischief to a minimum...</p><hr><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Master, are you going to go to Da Vinci to report your findings?</p><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Understood. Good work.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> See you.</p><hr><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Aaack!</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> ...Da...!</p><p><strong>David:</strong> Hmmm...I see...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Have you been waiting outside the whole time?</p><hr><p><strong>David:</strong> No. Absolutely not. This is just a really, really, really fortunate coincidence.</p><p><strong>David:</strong> Besides, if I was going to hang around outside, I&#39;d have just knocked.</p><p><strong>David:</strong> I just so happened to pass by\u2013 (Fidget, fidget)</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> Hnnnrrrrrrgh...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Her fur is standing on end...</p><hr><p><strong>David:</strong> ...Hmmm. Ah! She truly is the unparalleled beauty of legend!</p><p><strong>David:</strong> I am unworthy of the honor of being in your presence, Your Majesty!</p><p><strong>David:</strong> ...But you know what? I&#39;m a bit disappointed...</p><p><strong>David:</strong> Just a liiiiiitle bit... She&#39;s not quite my type.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> \u2014Eh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Okay, she&#39;s kinda tall, but is that really why?</p><hr><p><strong>David:</strong> Oh, how unfortunate! Unfortunate, but... Yes, I can move on.</p><p><strong>David:</strong> The queen is a beauty, but not really my type of beauty. Let&#39;s just leave it at that.</p><p><strong>David:</strong> Welp! Off to the cafeteria to enjoy some babka.</p><p><strong>David:</strong> See you later, Fujimaru. I will let you take the role of the Queen&#39;s escort!</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> ...Huh? WHAT!?</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> WHAT IS WITH HIM!?</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> With that face...that voice...saying things like that!</p><p><strong>Queen of Sheba:</strong> I don&#39;t like him! I hate him! I want to go back to the desert!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Don&#39;t let that vagabond get under your skin, my Queen.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Looks like we&#39;re going to have equipment trouble for a bit longer...</p><hr><p><strong>Kid Gil:</strong> Ahahaha.
