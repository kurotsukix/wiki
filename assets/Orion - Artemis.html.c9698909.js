Are you here?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Please leave.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;m not home.</p><hr><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> How mean! Darling, this Master is neglecting his duties.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> ...Darling?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um, please don&#39;t stare at me like that.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fuukaaaa!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> It&#39;s fine, it&#39;s all right, it&#39;s not like it&#39;ll hurt you.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> ...Hmph!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You (Orion) are in trouble, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> That&#39;s right. I&#39;m in trouble. Physically.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Please leave.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I just remembered something, gotta go.</p><hr><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Darling, This person is so heartless.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Just because Mash is here is no excuse!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ???</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> ...Just tell them what you want already.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Okay! Um, we want to go to France!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Why?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> For what reason?</p><hr><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Our honeymoon!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Please leave!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We&#39;re here...</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Wow, so this is France! It&#39;s wonderful! The air&#39;s so different than Greece!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Sorry, she&#39;s being so selfish...</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Let&#39;s get this honeymoon started! First, the Arc de Triomphe!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The Arc de Triomphe was built in 1806, so it doesn&#39;t exist yet...</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> How about the Eiffel Tower?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s 1887. If you&#39;re willing to wait another 450 years or so...</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Aww! No way!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Right, right, are you done? Let&#39;s just wander around a bit and go home.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I really don&#39;t feel like going on a tourist trip...</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Sigh... I guess we&#39;ll have to see the towns or something.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> But it&#39;s probably boring without the Arc de Triomphe or Eiffel Tower... Let&#39;s go, but don&#39;t expect too much.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Aww, it really is boring. The only things different are the buildings and clothes.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> There&#39;s people, there&#39;s dogs...</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> And there&#39;s monsters...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Why are there monsters here? Oh, forget it. Let&#39;s just fight them! Help me out!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> What? I don&#39;t wanna!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Just do it!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Okaay.

I didn&#39;t expect to see monsters...</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> What are they doing here? This world was repaired, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Something might be happening. We have to look into it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Let&#39;s do that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Agreed.</p><hr><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Huh? But our honeymoon...</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Right, right.

Listen, Artemis.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> &quot;This is our honeymoon.&quot; We&#39;re fighting monsters on our honeymoon.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> We&#39;ll sightsee and beat bad guys.

I know it sounds totally fun to me!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> ...Yeah, you&#39;re right! Darling, I love you!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Your love is way too clingy. No thanks.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> That&#39;s so mean!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Master, do those two like each other, or not?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What do you think?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I&#39;m not sure.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> They&#39;re lovey-dovey.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I-I see.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Love is... Very deep.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Where are we?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> An abandoned military camp, I think. There shouldn&#39;t be anything interesting here.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Yeah, the only interesting things would be... You see all those bags in the corner?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, I do...</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Body bags, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> They are.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> ...They&#39;re moving around.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Aah! That&#39;s scary! Orion, protect me!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> It&#39;s the other way around, dummy! I need you to protect me!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So this time it&#39;s the living dead, huh? Artemis, let&#39;s fight!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Okay! Orion needs my help, which powers me up! Let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> ...Whew. That was hard work.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You did nothing.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You did something?</p><hr><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Master, don&#39;t say that. It&#39;s depressing... It makes me really sad...</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Sad Orion is so cute! Mmmmmmm!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> You&#39;ll crush me! You&#39;re crushing me! And I&#39;m not cute, I&#39;m cool!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Come on, let&#39;s go somewhere else. This time, I&#39;d like someplace that doesn&#39;t smell like blood!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> O-Okay, we&#39;ll go somewhere else.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> ...This place reeks of blood!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m sorry. But this castle should have been purified long ago\u2013</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Aww, my honeymoon... Our trip as newlyweds...</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Don&#39;t worry, as long as we defeat whatever&#39;s lurking here, I&#39;m sure the smell will be gone.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Hmph... I&#39;m really irritated now! Whoever runs into me should just blame their fate!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Let&#39;s go, Orion, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Okay, we beat them!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Sigh, oh brother... I&#39;m tired (mentally, even though I did nothing)...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> To think Lamias nested up in the castle...</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> My honeymoon is ruined...</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> ...Hmm? Hey, Artemis.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> What is it, Darling?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Here.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Huh? This is...a ring?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> The Lamia had it...

I&#39;ll treasure it forever! Yay! Hooray!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Sigh. Oh, brother...</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Master, Mash. Sorry for the trouble.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Not at all. ...I see. Their love is very complex.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But it&#39;s kind of nice to watch.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> I-It&#39;s not like that, okay!? This is... um... it&#39;s not like that!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> No one likes a male tsundere.</p><hr><p><strong>Orion:</strong> It&#39;s not like that, I said\u2013 Argh, whatever!

Why is there no one here?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That cry... Is that... A wyvern?</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Oh, wonderful! A dragon!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> ...Wait, I&#39;m sick of dragons.

But I was embarrassed!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Then it doesn&#39;t matter! What kind of god cares what happens to other people?</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> But\u2013</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> One more thing! ...Throw those stupid worries that I&#39;m going to hate you into Hades or something!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> It&#39;s too late!

Food time? Here you go.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Mash, that was a sad response. As a goddess, that absolutely infuriates me!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> M-my apologies. I was just surprised that it was a golden anniversary...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Doesn&#39;t a golden anniversary mean...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, it is a celebration for a couple who&#39;s been married for fifty years.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The celebration is said to have started in the year 1860 in Germany, and the custom spread throughout Europe.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Oh, I see. It must have been a big deal if a couple was together for 50 years in the nineteenth century.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> No wonder people want to celebrate.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Isn&#39;t it wonderful? I admire that kind of celebration...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The custom is to give gifts of gold, or anything made in pairs.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> ...So what&#39;s this golden thing have to do with anything?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, um... Artemis, your marriage was quite recent...</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> I&#39;M STILL SINGLE!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> How cruel! But we did get married! Married! M-A-R-R-I-E-D!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> We even went on a honeymoon, and you even gave me a ring!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> She&#39;s having a tantrum...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But Artemis is correct. You gave her a ring, and you went on a honeymoon.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Heh. Miss Mash. You&#39;ve forgotten one critical thing: I&#39;m a nice guy who goes around freely like a wandering cloud in the sky.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> From one journey to another, from port to port... I start from Greece and go all around the world.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So you want to travel around the world...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> To do a lot of Celtic-ing with a bunch of women.</p><hr><p><strong>Orion:</strong> DAMN RIGHT!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> (Gasp!)

Now that I think of it, we&#39;re Heroic Spirits...</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> ...and Heroic Spirits essentially have no concept of time.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> I feel like we&#39;ve been together for fifty years already.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> You&#39;re absolutely right, darling! For fifty years, our love as a married couple has grown stronger!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> He&#39;s been brainwashed...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What makes this sad is that...though it could be harmful, this shouldn&#39;t be much of a hindrance to us if we don&#39;t do anything...</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Now come, let&#39;s do a golden anniversary! Um, what do we do on a golden anniversary?</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Shall we gather a bunch of humans with the golden touch, like King Midas?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Stop.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Please no.</p><hr><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Oh, you&#39;re right! A golden statue is nothing special these days! ...If that&#39;s the case, it has to be...</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> A Rayshift trip to travel around the world!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (Mash...)</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (Yes, I have a very bad feeling about this.

The ocean is outside my jurisdiction but that just makes it all the more exciting.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> We&#39;re in an era where I don&#39;t have to fight for territory. So let&#39;s have a nice, peaceful talk about our married life!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Where&#39;s Orion?</p><hr><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> ...Darling!?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Hahahaha! Successfully escaped!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> I mean, I know we&#39;ll eventually go back to Chaldea, so I am definitely going to get punished...</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> But to hell with that! My name&#39;s Orion, the famed hunter of love!!!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> I&#39;m a hero with a real lust for life, if you know what I&#39;m saying! Because when I&#39;m around, it&#39;s always bear season, eyy!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> \uFF5E\u266A</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Whoa! I spy a real sweet hottie over there!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> I only see the back of her head, but it&#39;s a black-haired beauty! Prim and proper! Looks like I hit the jackpot!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Woohoo! I&#39;m gonna snuggle her by pretending to be a cute creature!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> My body is a cute teddy bear!

We&#39;re coming to rescue you!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> And then afterwards, if you can explain to me IN DETAIL why you fled, that would be appreciated!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (Artemis may be worried about Orion, but she is still REALLY angry...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Huh. Well, he&#39;ll be missed.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> He&#39;s not dead yet!!!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Let&#39;s go, Master! Let&#39;s go and save my darling!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> There will be many mouths-to-mouths! Much smooching!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I hate to break this to you, but mouth-to-mouth won&#39;t be effective on a caved-in skull!</p><hr><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Ummm, according to my goddess senses, he should be around here...</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> There!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Kyuuu...kyuu...kyu...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Orion...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Has turned into a creature that&#39;s only cute...</p><hr><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Come to your senses, Darling! I shall immediately do mouth-to-mouth on you!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Hng!!! (Squeeze)</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Gagck!? ...!?!?!?!?!?!!?!?!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> S-S-S-S-S-S-Senpai! Orion&#39;s face is turning into something unbelievable! Even though he&#39;s only a bear! Even though he&#39;s only a plushie...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (Punch Orion with all my might.)</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Ahhh... Aaaaaagck!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (Pull Artemis away with all my might.)</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Kyaaah!? Master, touching someone else&#39;s wife is fiendish!!!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> And doing so in front of Mash...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No, it&#39;s fine! I know this is all a misunderstanding, so I&#39;m not mad!</p><hr><p><strong>Orion:</strong> I thought I was gonna die. Actually, I did die. TWICE! Once from my caved-in skull, and again from getting suffocated!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m glad you\u2013</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Master. Have you ever wondered why you&#39;re alive?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> A few times...</p><hr><p><strong>Orion:</strong> We both...have it tough...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> My apologies... Something like a tiny wild animal jumped on me, so I punched it to smithereens without thinking...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Martha...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Yes, I know! I know what you are thinking! But I hope you understand my predicament as well!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> As you know, in this getup, I become more aggressive than usual.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> So...I couldn&#39;t help it... I&#39;m sorry! I regret my actions! So much so, I will double my praying time!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> This woman&#39;s amazing. That was the first time I ever felt my insides leaking out.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> His first time... How dare she be my darling&#39;s first!!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> This is unforgivable! You&#39;re supposed to be a saint... Have you no shame!?</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> The only person who can hurt my darling is me!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Oh boy. Aren&#39;t you just full of cheerful bloodlust.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> And she&#39;s your wife.</p><hr><p><strong>Orion:</strong> What. A. Let. Down.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Uh, um... I&#39;m not sure if I can say this, given that I was the one who directly inflicted this holy punishment...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Actually, I am not foolish enough to get involved in lovers&#39; quarrels or domestic disputes...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I&#39;m not like that, but...Artemis! Your love is a bit too aggressive!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> First of all, love should be tender, even when you&#39;re hurting your beloved.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> No matter how fiendish, devilish, demonic, or even...um, ursine your partner is\u2014</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I can say with certainty that unrequited love is no good!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> It&#39;s not unrequited! We are very much in love!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> I&#39;m actually a little hurt to be called fiendish, devilish, and demonic.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> No. If it truly was a mutual love, no married man would so casually hit on another woman.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Even if Orion is guilty, I can see that Artemis also has need for improvement and reform.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I do not intend to criticize the ways of the Greeks, but I am called the patron saint of wives!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Artemis and Orion! I shall correct your twisted, unrequited love with my holy fists!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> This is going to hurt...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Head trauma, here I come...</p><hr><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Well, yes, I&#39;m afraid that&#39;s the plan! Don&#39;t worry. I will make sure not to hurt you much, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Ungh... She&#39;s tough! Darling, were you holding back!?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> &#39;Course not! I always take battle seriously!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Mnnngh...as obsessive and unhealthy as it is, love is still love...I suppose.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> And based on Orion&#39;s behavior, it doesn&#39;t seem like it is completely unrequited love...</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> That&#39;s right! Our love is mutual... It is!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Mutual love... To think of others, and love others.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It doesn&#39;t appear that way... No, but maybe...those two seem to have some bizarre sort of love of their own...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Even if they do not follow the same path, or if it&#39;s unrequited, as long as they respect one another, that may be fine...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> ...Well, there are indeed very dangerous unrequited affections in this world...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> And yet... I suppose...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> ...Either way, I seem to have jumped to conclusions. One cannot say that just understanding each other can be called love.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I&#39;m sorry, Artemis. And Bearion.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> No matter what form it takes, love is unchanging, and it is one of the primal emotions. One should love greatly, and so find great happiness.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Our beliefs may differ, but love is the same all around! Orion, let&#39;s love each other to the fullest!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Oh?</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Huh? I thought my head felt light. Darling&#39;s gone.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> He sneaked away a minute ago.</p><hr><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Daaarrrliiing!!!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Fwahahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> I don&#39;t know how or where I escaped to, but looks like I ended up in a different world!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> What should I do? It&#39;ll be scary if I get found now. Maybe I should hide out here for a couple of days until things cool down.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Oh? Oh my, oh my. A guest. It&#39;s a guest! And it&#39;s a bear!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Oh, sir! Are you the one she&#39;s been waiting for?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Not sure what you&#39;re talking about, but sure!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I see. Then we need to have a wedding!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Uh, actually, wrong person! I mean, wrong bear!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> It&#39;s a wedding! The entire country is going to party! The princess will surely be pleased!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Her prince has come back!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Time to be a sneaky bear...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> No! You can&#39;t run away! (Grab)</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Gyaaah! Let go! You got the wrong bear!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Nothing good can come of me posing as a prince in a fairytale place like this!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Don&#39;t be so naughty!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> A bad prince like you...needs to turn into a \u25A0\u25A0\u25A0!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> This curse won&#39;t break until the princess kisses you!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> ...What the heck!?</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Here! I&#39;ve got darling&#39;s scent!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...I&#39;m exhausted.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You really are getting dragged around the world.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Where could Orion have fled to so quickly?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You mean...the scent of your prey?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master&#39;s burn doesn&#39;t have the usual sting... Maybe because jet lag has [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her} worn out?</p><hr><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> What a cute town...</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> After our golden anniversary celebration, I would love to live in a home like this!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Master, since you saved the world, I want you to find a nice property for me!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> And I want you to live nearby, so we can be neighbors!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> You know, it&#39;s important to have good neighbors!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Good neighbors...</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Now all I need is my darling...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Oh? Oh my, oh my. There are so many visitors today!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I&#39;m so happy. Adults and children both are welcome in the Land of Sweets!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Why? Because I can just turn the adults into children, and then it&#39;s fine!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Nursery Rhyme...!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Oh my, you are a cutie. But... I&#39;m sorry, my heart belongs only to my darling!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> But that strange fate of yours, make sure you treasure it, okay?</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Anyway, have you seen my darling?</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> Darling...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> The talking stuffed bear.</p><hr><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> Oh no... You can&#39;t! That prince bear is the princess&#39;s!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> ...What did you just say?</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> The prince has finally come home to his sweet princess!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> And we&#39;re going to hold a grand wedding party to celebrate! You can&#39;t steal someone&#39;s true love in a fairytale!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> ...Oh? Uh-huuuh...</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Hey Master. Sounds like my darling is at the princess&#39;s place.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> How strange. If he&#39;s not here, where could he be?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> M-Master...this is bad! This is very bad!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m afraid the Land of Sweets is going to be set on fire, melting the chocolates and candies... Even the cakes will get charred!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Calm down!</p><hr><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> It&#39;s fine. I am calm. But I will never forgive Orion.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> A grand party with a princess... This isn&#39;t an affair... This is the real deal!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> This was supposed to be a happy golden anniversary celebration...but to learn that he&#39;s in another serious relationship...! Orion, you dummy!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> Protect the Land of Sweets, everyone!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m not sure if they&#39;re enemies...but let&#39;s ready for battle, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> Kyuuu. I&#39;m dizzy...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Poor Nursery Rhyme is down!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> I will not allow my darling to get married! I&#39;ll capture that bear and take him to file divorce papers right away!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Oh, and Master, use your authority to annul the marriage! That way, he won&#39;t be a divorc\xE9!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Darling, where are you!?</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> Um... Excuse me... Are you perhaps looking for a bear?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Brynhild!?</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Are you the homewrecker!?</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> Please, no... It is not what you think...</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> ...I wanted to return him to you.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> ...Come again?</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Darling! No... Look at you...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (I thought I saw a similar-looking chocolate during last year&#39;s Valentine&#39;s Day...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> He&#39;s mouthing something...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> \u201CHelp...\u201D</p><hr><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> Um... I was searching for Sigurd...</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> Nursery brought this bear thinking he was Sigurd...</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> Even when I said he wasn&#39;t, she wouldn&#39;t listen. She said, \u201CHe may be a chocolate bear right now, but he&#39;ll turn into Sigurd when the curse is lifted.\u201D</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> And so I was a little flustered.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Is there a way to lift the chocolate curse?</p><hr><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> Yes... According to Nursery...</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> You KISS him!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You what, now?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What!?</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Kiss!?</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> Yes, that&#39;s right. Kissing him will lift the chocolate curse!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> His bear curse may also get lifted, but I&#39;m not sure, since that&#39;s not my specialty!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I see...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So that&#39;s why Brynhild was flustered... She was afraid that whoever could lift the curse wouldn&#39;t show up if she left.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> Yes, I was at a loss.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> This bear is not Sigurd, but there is no doubt he is a hero.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> No matter what form he&#39;d taken, as a former Valkyrie, I didn&#39;t feel right abandoning him...</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Hey Master, why do you think darling tries to escape?</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Weddings, golden anniversary celebrations... They don&#39;t really matter to me... Well, I might not go that far.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> But as long as my darling just stays with me... As long as he and I can live together forever, for eternity...</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> That&#39;s all I really need.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> He&#39;s scared he&#39;ll start to hate you.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Scared...that he&#39;ll hate me?</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> ...That may be correct.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> No matter how intimate a man and woman might be, if they are together for long enough, they may end up killing each other.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> That is not because of pure hatred, but hatred that stems from love.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> The more one loves, the stronger their wish not to detest or be detested becomes.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> Human emotion is not something that is constant... But it shines all the brighter for it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> He loves, therefore he wants to be pursued.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> I know! I know!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> The prince falls for Cinderella when she flees!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> That bear flees from you because he wants you to always feel excited!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> Because eternity is too boring!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> When you&#39;re super bored, you might start hating the person you&#39;re with!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> That&#39;s why you flee! The chase keeps you interested in the other person!</p><hr><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> ...I see. So that&#39;s how human emotions work.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> As a Divine Spirit, that kind of thinking is incomprehensible to me. I can&#39;t imagine eternity being...uncertain...</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> ...True, it may not be something you can comprehend. I really only understand it in theory.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Eternity is boring... So you say.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Aw, my darling is impossible! He wants me to keep loving him by making me so anxious!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Fine. If that&#39;s what he wants, I&#39;ll chase after him for eternity!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> As long as my heart swells from the occasional, whimsical kindness from him, I will go absolutely crazy for my darling!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Yes, yes, my Maiden Circuits are in overdrive! Now, my darling! I shall lift your dreadful chocolate curse!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Owwwwwwwwwwwwwww!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Good morning, my darling!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Eh? Huh? I thought I was chocolate...</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Ack! Artemis!? I-I&#39;m sorry I ran away! It was just a spur of the moment thing! I swear!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> ...Yep! It&#39;s fine, my darling. I forgive you!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Eh, seriously!?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Normally this kind of offense would result in you reducing me to my constituent atoms!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Wait, did I end up in a parallel world? Is this for real? Oh, no, I&#39;m in a world that&#39;s gonna get pruned, aren&#39;t I!?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Oh, but if it&#39;s a parallel world...</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Come, my darling. Let&#39;s continue our golden anniversary celebration!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Where shall we go next? It is a golden anniversary, so maybe the Temple of the Golden Pavilion in Japan?</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Or perhaps the Golden Gate Bridge?</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Anywhere is fine. As long as I&#39;m with my darling, it will be wonderful!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Why hello there, delicate-looking girl. I don&#39;t see much of your type in Greece.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> How would you like to escape into a love adventure, hmm?</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> Um... I can&#39;t... My lance will become lighter and lighter...</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> It could even float up and away like a balloon...</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Wha\u2013whoa!?</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Okay, my darling.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Let&#39;s go get you set on fire at the Temple of the Golden Pavilion. It&#39;s fine, you&#39;ll burn well!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Or the Golden Gate Bridge is fine too. You can bungee jump without a rope!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Well, I guess that&#39;s one way to go...</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> ...What the heck am I making clever commentary for!? Aaand Artemis is just her usual self!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> HEEELLLP MEEE!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Master, do you have any closing remarks?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Love takes so many forms!</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> That wasn&#39;t...much of a closing remark...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Love is scary!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> That&#39;s my line.</p><hr>',671),a=[e];function g(i,p){return r(),o("div",null,a)}var u=t(n,[["render",g],["__file","Orion - Artemis.html.vue"]]);export{u as default};
