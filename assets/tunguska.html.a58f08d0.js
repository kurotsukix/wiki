Well, that was a strange way to communicate.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Man, how surprising. I never expected them to contact me.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> From the Gate of Rebirth, huh? Ganu, they said...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Come to think of it, I have records of a Clock Tower mage becoming an apprentice around 1000 AD.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Did they assign someone from a relatively recent time period as liaison? Or is it a simple staff shortage?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Ah, this isn&#39;t the time to worry about that. Let&#39;s get back to work!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> TRISMEGISTUS II. Catastrophe Automation, halt. Now, show me what&#39;s falling apart today!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> And there it is.

The singularity came to be in January 2017, but it was established back in 1908.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> It was microscopic at first, but this past year...no, the past few days, it&#39;s ballooned in size massively.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Just like a Lostbelt. It must have experienced nearly a century&#39;s worth of time in an instant.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> If left unchecked, it&#39;ll spread all over Eurasia. Humanity will be reduced to lower animals.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Eww, that&#39;s not a peaceful end.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> We&#39;ve seen a lot of ends for mankind by now, but it&#39;s rare for humanity to be removed from the top of the food chain.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Well done, Beast IV. You truly are an Evil of Humanity.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Then we&#39;ll prepare an adequate response.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> TRISMEGISTUS II. Send an urgent communication to Chaldea&#39;s top brass.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> &quot;Juvenile Beast activity confirmed. Would like to commence suppression mission within 24 hours.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> &quot;Estimate the battle will be fought under special conditions, as with Britain&#39;s Lostbelt.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> &quot;In addition, Chaldea Base is currently undergoing year-end renovations, and is unable to make use of either Rayshift or Zero Sail.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> &quot;Onsite travel will be conducted by Storm Border. All staff members are requested to be onboard.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> &quot;Subjugation target is Chaldea&#39;s archenemy, the juvenile Beast, Tamamovitch Koyanskaya.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Now then. This is where she&#39;s been hiding since she disappeared from Britain...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> She probably wouldn&#39;t have originally revealed her nest until both Chaldea and the Alien God were taken care of.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> But her strange behavior in Britain&#39;s Lostbelt is alarming. Her tail&#39;s in gear, literally!</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Ttv1BLE.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Still, that doesn&#39;t change that she&#39;s a powerful enemy. We&#39;ll need a lot to beat her...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> This battle is an unavoidable step towards uniting Chaldea&#39;s forces against the Alien God.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Please do your utmost. All I can do is place my trust in you.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/cjCyt4q.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Well, TRISMEGISTUS II has given us the results this time anyway!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> No matter what they do, Chaldea is wiped out!

The location is old Russia.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Russia?</p><hr><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> It&#39;s a region far removed from the old Russian Lostbelt, but like all other regions on the planet,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> most of it has already been rendered blank. And all of a sudden, a new reaction manifested there.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> No, I suppose &quot;all of a sudden&quot; is not quite the right way to put it.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> What has already been in existence for several months now has rapidly expanded over the past few days...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> What it means is that the veil meant to pull the wool over humanity&#39;s eyes...that mask has finally been peeled off.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Central Siberia, to be specific. The Krasnoyarsk region.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> That places it\u2014around the forested area upstream of the Tunguska river.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Any Heroic Spirit who lived in the same time period as I would know of that large-scale light emission.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/NLW5OVo.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Tunguska...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I have read the records. The Tunguska explosion, otherwise known as the Tungus explosion.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou fou?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> That is correct. It was an explosion that occurred over Tunguska in 1908 A.D.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Back in the day, it was not confirmed to have been an explosion...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> But it was a dreadful light. Even now, I can still see it in my eyes.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You were in England at the time, Holmes...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Its brilliance could be seen even from somewhere as far away as England. It was a dreadful explosion.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> The forest region was incinerated by the intense heat and further damaged heavily by the shockwave...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> But miraculously enough, there were no confirmed human casualties.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Naturally, it was a colossal disaster. There may have been casualties that were not on the records.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> At the very least, tremendous damage had been done to nature. Untold amounts of flora and fauna were lost.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;ve heard about it too...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...a fallen meteorite and an explosion...</p><hr><p><strong>Sion:</strong> That appears to be how the truth is told. I believe it&#39;s also seen as such by magical society.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Even if you unravel the records, you&#39;d be hard-pressed to find any magical factors there.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/RRslRXM.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That&#39;s not to say that no one associated it with the occult, but at the very least, the Mage&#39;s Association has ruled it a natural phenomenon.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> There is no evidence of Mystery having been employed.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That&#39;s why this is an enigma. Why is it in Tunguska?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Well, I could venture a guess, but\u2014</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Now&#39;s not the time to speak of it?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> That is how it is. Let us start with the facts.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> A unique domain that is neither Singularity nor Lostbelt has formed on the blank surface of Tunguska.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s not a Singularity?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> The reaction is different from what we would identify as a Holy Grail. As such, we felt it prudent to classify it as something other than a Singularity.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It&#39;s not a Lostbelt either?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Yes. After all, there is no storm wall present. Furthermore, there is no &quot;variance&quot; as far as humanity goes.</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It&#39;s not like we don&#39;t have any guesses, but\u2014</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> They&#39;re not based on any empirical evidence. There&#39;s a good chance it would lead to misunderstandings, so let&#39;s not go there.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> What we can pinpoint at this moment is the cause of this abnormality\u2014no, the name of this enemy we must exterminate.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> TRISMEGISTUS II and Observation Lens SHEBA have both identified this magical signature as a juvenile Beast.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> The name of the enemy is Tamamovitch Koyanskaya. It&#39;s safe to say this unique domain is her &quot;stronghold&quot;.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fouuuu...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Are we done with the explanation? Then allow me to say this once more.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> In regards to the reaction detected in the forest region of old Tunguska!

There&#39;s a good chance she&#39;s recovering the power she&#39;s lost.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Or perhaps she&#39;s plotting to grow further...?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> There&#39;s no reason to reveal your hideout just because you sustained an injury.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Putting something she had hidden out there in the open means there&#39;s no longer a need to keep it hidden, and\u2014</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> That sounds likely.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> The undefined form we encountered in Olympus was most likely an incomplete state.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> The large horns seen in matured Beasts could not be seen in her previous form.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Juvenile...growth...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> ...may I? All personnel, I&#39;d like you to hear me out.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> ...as Meuni\xE8re has mentioned, that accursed Koyanskaya protected this ship in the Fairy Kingdom.</p><p><strong>Chaldea Staff:</strong> (The new director...)</p><p><strong>Chaldea Staff:</strong> (He actually got Meuni\xE8re&#39;s name right for the first time in forever!?)</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> That is an unmistakable fact. And this may be information you have no way of knowing, but...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Chillingly enough, she behaved much like a human, in a manner befitting a CEO.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> She did not just dispatch troops. She provided medical equipment and aid to those in great poverty.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Even if it was just good business, she was sincere in her dealings with those who sought help.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> She may possess the traits of a &quot;femme fatale and a devil&quot;, but she was not a unilateral exploiter either.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> If you talked to her, she...no, it&#39;s just &quot;something&quot; she used to establish dialogues.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> But...but!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> No matter what, we cannot afford to overlook the growth of a Beast!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Besides...this responsibility is mine to bear.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> This is especially true for those of you who knew the old Chaldea.

As of this moment, Chaldea will prepare for combat!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> The battle against the &quot;Alien God&quot;.A resolution to the &quot;bleaching of the Earth&quot;.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Putting that top priority on hold, we will divert all our efforts towards exterminating Koyanskaya!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (Finally...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> New Director Gordolf...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Understood.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Nevertheless, this is not entirely a detour! We cannot afford to waste resources in that manner!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> While this is an anti-Beast operation, we will also be using this as a test run for the elimination of the seventh Lostbelt!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Our upcoming confrontation with the Alien God...consider this a rehearsal for that as well!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> In other words!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> We expect the Black Barrel will see active deployment!</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/bvl5I1K.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The Black Barrel...measures the target&#39;s Life Scale with the Accomplish Measure,</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> and attacks using &quot;life&quot; itself as a bullet,</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But if it&#39;s used individually without a Command Spell involved, it is now possible with just Habetrot&#39;s assistance alone.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It will end up being a physical weapon instead of a conceptual one though. But it will still be plenty effective as a weapon, considering its firepower.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The barrel will burn out, so consecutive fire is out of the question, but being able to use it on demand is still a big deal.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Mm. I&#39;ve grasped the situation with the Black Barrel. Next up is\u2014</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> the essence of the Divine Construct we acquired in the British Lostbelt.

But somehow, my soul understood that just now!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> The Plan to Eliminate the Seventh Lostbelt\u2014of course, is centered around Excalibur.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> However, we also have a secondary asset planned to supplement it. That is,</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> the simultaneous mass summoning of Chaldea&#39;s Heroic Spirits that becomes possible by running the Storm Border&#39;s magical furnaces in parallel.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> In other words, that&#39;s right\u2014</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The Large Scale Plan!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Storming the enemy&#39;s turf with a flood of Chaldea&#39;s Heroic Spirits, while keeping them continuously materialized.

I zoned out while watching the dragon talk.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (They really are kindred spirits, the two of them...)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (Y-Yes.)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (Do you think the two of them are related in some manner?)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (How should I put it, they really are on the same page.)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (They&#39;re perfectly synchronized!)</p><hr><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> I am Dobrynya Nikitich. You, the dragon.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/SaE0gel.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> Feel free to call me either Dobrynya or Nikitich.</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong> I already know your True Name, but I see. So you&#39;re Dobrynya Nikitich!</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> I see, so you&#39;re going with the full name...how avaricious.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> One of the legendary bogatyrs who served the Grand Prince of Kiev. One who slew an evil dragon.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> You&#39;re the hero of Kiev!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Nikitich...hmm. I have heard of you before.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> The three-headed dragon Gorynych\u2014the Zmei with three heads and twelve tails.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> So you&#39;re the hero who bested it alone not once, but twice. There was also this anecdote of them having gone to Constantinople.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> While it is curious that you look female, I do suppose that heroes come in many different forms!</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong> Small ones and big ones!</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> Hm.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> I am strong. I can handle almost anything.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Mmm. Mmm!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Taigong the beast slayer and Dobrynya Nikitich the dragon slayer!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> I consider it an excellent outcome seeing how the operation has just begun. The odds are in our favor, ladies and gentlemen.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> \u2014Taigong, Nikitich.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Yes?</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> Hm.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I apologize for not introducing myself earlier.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I am Mash Kyrielight, a Demi-Servant.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I am acting on behalf of the Organization for the Preservation of the Human Order Chaldea to reclaim human history.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> And here&#39;s our Master...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m Fujimaru of Chaldea.</p><hr><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Right, pleasure to meet you.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> The last Master of mankind and Servant. I have heard of your exploits from Lord Yuanshi Tianzun...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> That is to say, I have learned a fair bit about you by way of the Human Order&#39;s guidance.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> I have already explained matters to Nikitich.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> I don&#39;t know much about the Human Order.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> But you&#39;ve got enemies, don&#39;t you? Then it&#39;s just a matter of obliterating them.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> What a remark, overflowing with motivation. This is as dependable as it gets.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> As expected of a dragon slayer.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> ...but aren&#39;t you a bit more bloodthirsty than normal? Are you okay? You&#39;re sure you&#39;re not a Berserker?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> No worries, she undoubtedly is of the Rider class. We&#39;re communicating just fine, aren&#39;t we?</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> Hmm. I can handle that. I&#39;ve already mastered the human tongue.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> (You sound all robotic like &quot;Human language, acquired&quot; though!?)</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Now then, let&#39;s confirm our objective. Taigong, Nikitich.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> We are in pursuit of one who we believe to be the monarch of this special territory.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Her name is Tamamovitch Koyanskaya.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> She is the juvenile Beast IV, and possesses the ability to nonchalantly cross the Lostbelts.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> However, her movements have stopped at present for some reason. She remains stationary at the heart of this area.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I don&#39;t know the details, but...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> in the worst case scenario, she may be plotting to emerge into her fully developed form.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> We would like to eliminate Koyanskaya before that happens, no matter what.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> So\u2014we would like you to lend us your strength. What do you say?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Of course, that&#39;s the idea.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> In fact, I have been waiting for you all to arrive.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Chaldea, I am glad you are a bunch of good-natured folks, just the way I heard it. Yep, that puts me at ease. Whew!</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> Are you really going to flatter them out of nowhere, Taigong?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Hahaha, it&#39;s not flattery, Nikitich. It&#39;s lip service.</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong> Isn&#39;t that what they call flattery?</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> You won&#39;t get any flattery from me. Hmph.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> Might is everything, that is, if you wish to be a bogatyr of salvation.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> Clothes only get in the way. Alright, it&#39;s easier to move now.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ANg1UUV.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Hold up.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gdXAJ0K.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> Let&#39;s see how good you are.

You already saw how good they are in that scuffle with the Lost Familiars earlier.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> I said, I want to see how good they are.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> !</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> M-Master! Nikitich&#39;s magical energy is on the rise!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> We should&#39;ve been able to peacefully negotiate...does it really have to end with a &quot;prepare for battle&quot; mood?</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> Let&#39;s do this.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> Heroic Spirits of Chaldea\u2014and this so-called Master!</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> Prove your valor to me!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/kvZELa2.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> Ha ha ha ha ha!</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Qvemm3x.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Gh!</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> Ah hah!

What a weird feeling!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> High-maneuverability aerial combat using a wyvern\u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Dobrynya Nikitich! A formidable opponent, Master!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Furthermore, that was a special attack against dragonkind, a suicide attack on Ibuki-Douji!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yeah, she&#39;s a dragonslaying dragon rider! Shouldn&#39;t she pick one or the other!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Then that white wyvern is probably a transformed version of her legendary horse!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Be careful, that&#39;s not a normal wyvern! Consider it on the level of a Heroic Spirit!</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> Challenging the unreasonable and doing the impossible is what makes a hero!</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> Now, I challenge you!</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> The wingless declare aerial battle impossible, and so on! I won&#39;t hear a word of that!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> ...oh no.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Oh no no no no. As usual, you exaggerate, Nikitich.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Those without wings can no more fly than a lost child can walk, yes?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> We&#39;re all adults, so this should be handled accordingly.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Unable to fly?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Unable to do the impossible?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Then someone should help them, Nikitich. And in this case\u2014</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> I shall.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> !</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong> Oh?

Please make use of me as a guide.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Unfortunately, we were not endowed with any knowledge of Chaldea&#39;s inner workings.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Only that you are an organization resisting on behalf of the Human Order.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> The trials you&#39;ve overcome to date. The current state of Chaldea, and knowledge of the six Lostbelts...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> I haven&#39;t the faintest clue about them.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> So I&#39;d like you to share that intelligence with me first\u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That would be very much appreciated.

Is that how the Lostbelts have been all this time?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Six in all. The number fits as well. This makes more and more sense.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Things have become far clearer thanks to your knowledge. Thank you so much.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> ...Mm, ahem. Now that things are out in the open, it&#39;s somewhat belated...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> but as commanding officer, I feel it necessary to point something out.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Fujimaru, and Kyrielight as well, aren&#39;t you both a bit too forthcoming for field investigators?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> &quot;No intel whatsoever&quot; is one thing, but to lay so much of our own bare in so one-sided an exch\u2014</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Mmph.

This time, about the &quot;hostile life forms that exist in this domain&quot;.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> I believe you have already encountered them, but broadly speaking, there are two types.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Firstly, there are the mass-produced units who are born in succession, as a species.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> The ones resembling Yaga and Kali may be those...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Those are beings unique to their respective Lostbelts...</p><hr><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Yes, that is true. You called them Yaga and Kali?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> I believe you&#39;ve also encountered the giants of Scandinavia, have you not?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> These mass-produced units are commonly known as Lost Familiars.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Sometimes, rare variants of a higher class do manifest...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> But for the most part, you can consider them the rank and file.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Oh, Lost Familiars is a term I came up with on my own. Please feel free to use it.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> They fall under the category of &quot;species that inhabit this domain&quot;.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Next up, you have these ultra-exceptional units formed via recreation! The Ivan recreation we just fought falls under this category.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> They fall under the category of &quot;an individual threat, unrelated to any species&quot;...Lost Weapons.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Hostile life forms that belong to a species are termed &quot;Lost Familiars&quot; and individual hostile entities are termed &quot;Lost Weapons&quot;.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> How about it? Simple enough, no?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> So far, there are six familiars and six weapons. Six species and six individuals.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> I wonder how many of them she intends to collect? There are but seven Lostbelts...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> No. That would be unlike her.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fou.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Anyway! We have done all that needs doing here.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> We should have whittled her forces down. Let us be on our way.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> Mmm!</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> Let&#39;s get moving! You, Dragon, fly off with Mash and Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong> Alrighty!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7z6lvrP.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Mm\u2014.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> That&#39;s right, around here should be good.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> The Lost Familiars have two types of behavorial patterns.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> They either stand by at accumulation points or move periodically along a patrol route.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> We&#39;re currently far off from either.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> So it&#39;s relatively safe.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fou.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Fou, if you get too close to the river edge...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou-fish!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Woah.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Wow, there are lots of fish\u2014</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> Mm.

They also like alcohol, right?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Would you like me to help you with fishing? It&#39;s my specialty.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> !!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> When speaking of Taigong, it has to be fishing!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Taigong. His fondness for fishing is so well known in China and Japan that his name is associated with anglers...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> As expected of Taigong.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That&#39;s right.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> But this time, my job is fox hunting\u2014beast hunting. We have to hunt that human-resenting beast.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/mLkmjzF.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hmm...This is an unusual case indeed.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You may be a stray Servant, but clearly you&#39;re aware of the Human Order.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Rather than the land, you&#39;re a Heroic Spirit summoned by the world itself...is that it?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> \u2014Yes, that&#39;s about right.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So could you be the Counter Force&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Oh, no no! It&#39;s not as clear cut as that.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Well\u2014</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> I guess this isn&#39;t the time to be modest. Alright, I&#39;m gonna say it!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> My usual self is, um...how should I say this?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Even manifesting with the Saint Graph of a Grand Caster wouldn&#39;t be odd, you know.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Uh.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Err.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/z5rfLVI.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong> Seriously?</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong> What happened?

I wonder if it&#39;s possible to be a Grand Rider as well?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Anyhow, it&#39;s not something strange. But for some reason, I&#39;m just a normal Rider here.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> In addition, since I&#39;ve been constantly using fangshu to twist the rules and avoid getting forced out...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> My power has been considerably drained. Ah, I&#39;m ashamed.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Being so serious about beast hunting... you&#39;re a professional Beast slayer indeed.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Unfortunately, he&#39;s currently manifested in a normal Saint Graph. With that said, it doesn&#39;t change the fact that it&#39;s very reassuring.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> No matter the state of my Saint Graph, there&#39;s probably only one thing that the Human Order wants from me.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> My job this time is to finish off that Beast IV candidate who&#39;s doing as she pleases everywhere.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Mm, what a mess.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> The Human Order and Lord Yuanshi Tianzun sure are working me to the bone!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> ...O-oh. Is that some type of Kunlun Mountain joke?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> When you suddenly reference the supreme being of a mythological system, it&#39;s hard to know how to react.</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong> That&#39;s right, it&#39;s not that funny...</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/K9nfvBd.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> I sure was talking big!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> However, the current me has a very much reduced amount of magical power.

Nikitich.</p><hr><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Yep, I&#39;m looking forward to working with you.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> Mm! It&#39;s about time I caught something.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/WI5fMC3.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Animals:</strong> (Fidgeting)</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7z6lvrP.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Leaving the fishing to Nikitich\u2014let&#39;s start our information sharing.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Mm-hmm. From the Russian Lostbelt came the Yaga...those Beastmen.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> From the Scandinavian Lostbelt, she collected the Giants. I wonder what she collected from the Chinese Lostbelt?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s unknown. We haven&#39;t encountered them yet either.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Hmm.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Perhaps...Were there tanks with tiger heads on them in the Chinese Lostbelt?</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/riz3iqd.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> T-there were...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> There were, indeed...</p><hr><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> I see. So there were.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> I knew it, so those were the Familiars from the Chinese Lostbelt, huh...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, um! I&#39;m sure they were there, but I thought it was a machine or...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> No, it&#39;s a living thing. Or at least, the one we came across in this region was.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> The tiger part is living. It even roars.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> !</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> So, basically...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Koyanskaya&#39;s battle strength in this region is essentially made up by what she acquired from the Lostbelts?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Essentially, yes.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> The six species of Lost Familiars are active in small numbers around the patrol routes.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> The Lost Weapons, who are ultra-exceptional units, exist for base defense and to be dispatched in abnormal situations.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That was a reproduction of Ivan the Terrible just now, wasn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Yes. He was indeed placed very effectively.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Since they have full control over the leylines, they keep reappearing every time we strike them down.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> An inexhaustible supply of Familiars...and you&#39;ve been fighting them all alone?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It&#39;s like being totally surrounded by enemies while deep within their territory.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m amazed you were able to survive...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> It&#39;s thanks to my speedy escapes, I guess!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Seems like you&#39;re barely scraping by.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> I&#39;m confident in my ability to escape. Yep.</p><hr><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> If they&#39;re struck down thoroughly enough, it&#39;ll be fine for a while. It&#39;s not to the extent where we have to lament the futility of fighting them.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...But they&#39;re in control of the leylines. It&#39;ll be difficult to set up a summoning circle then.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Unfortunately so.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> With that said, each location doesn&#39;t have a connection that transmits information to Koyanskaya.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> They&#39;re also cut off in terms of magical connections. The base&#39;s Lost Weapons are all in a state of complete autonomy.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Much like Koyanskaya...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Basically, we&#39;re unlikely to be noticed unless we&#39;re near the &quot;castle&quot; in the center.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> &quot;Castle&quot;, huh\u2014</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> I caught a fish!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> The unexpected Strong Style!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That&#39;s not fishing, you&#39;re just grabbing it!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Your whole body is soaked! A-are you okay?</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> No problem.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gzmGgQr.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> Bububububububububu. (Water droplets splashing around)</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> That will dry me off.</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong> Hahahaha...and I&#39;m soaking as well. Hahaha!</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong> Judging by those ears, Nikichi has to be some type of animal incarnation, isn&#39;t she?</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong> And she&#39;s adept at shaking herself dry too!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> (Oh. You&#39;re cutting in there, Divine Spirit Ibuki-Douji!)</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> Oho, you&#39;re interested in my ears?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Nikitich, um...are you a Beastman?</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> No, I&#39;m not.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> (She&#39;s not?)</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> I&#39;m not, but my wife was a strong, beautiful she-giant, more beast than man.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So those beast ears are your wife&#39;s...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Maybe your Saint Graph reproduces her features?</p><hr><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong> That&#39;s so sweet. I wonder if you&#39;re a Heroic Spirit that receives blessings from the love between you two.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> I see! So that&#39;s why you&#39;re in the form of a woman!</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> No, it&#39;s not.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> It&#39;s not...</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> Or it might be, a little.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> O-oh? So your ears and form are indeed because of your wife&#39;s blessing\u2014</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> Hm~.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> ...Which is it?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Well then. I have a theory.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> What kind of principle is this region employing to force out Heroic Spirits of the Human Order\u2014?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> ...It would be easy to talk about it here, but I&#39;d like for you to wait a while.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hm. And what is your reasoning for that?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> It&#39;s necessary for you Chaldeans to receive some prerequisite knowledge.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> In order to do that, we need to gain an understanding of this area. Specifically, there are two places I&#39;d like to visit.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> It&#39;s easier to show than to explain.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> And above all \u2014</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Yes, your understanding about Koyanskaya should change a lot.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> At the same time, you should also learn why Nikitich and Ibuki-Douji aren&#39;t forced out as well.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...Seems like you&#39;re putting on airs, Heroic Spirit Taigong. Or should I say, Grand Candidate Taigong?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> A presentation should be effective, shouldn&#39;t it? I tend to be particular about those sort of things by nature.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> And well, there really are some things in the world that just can&#39;t be described adequately with words alone.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> That&#39;s how I came to terms with the region myself. How you guys will feel about it though...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> I&#39;m not so sure about that.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I understand.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Fujimaru, Mash. What do you think about his statement?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> If there&#39;s something you want to show, I&#39;ll have a look.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> A picture is worth a thousand words, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> Hm. Shall we move then?</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> Alright. But we&#39;ve got to finish eating the fish first.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> Let&#39;s bake them.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Hm~.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Sorry, Nikitich, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea to make smoke.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> You can use a technique then.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Huh. That&#39;s your reply!?</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> There was a technique for roasting fish amongst your sage and dao arts, wasn&#39;t there?</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> The seasoning is perfect! More salt, pepper, and others can be added just by wishing for it.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> Fine adjustments can be done as well! I&#39;ve already skewered them all!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Yes, yes...</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong> Wow, that smells great! The fish will be cooked in no time!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> How convenient...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> So these are sage arts?</p><hr><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Oh no, it&#39;s actually one of my originals.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> I quite like fishing, so I thought it would be useful to have a technique that allows me to eat the fish as soon as I catch them.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> As expected of Taigong, the man associated with anglers\u2014</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Oh, really?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Ah, that&#39;s a bit embarrassing.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> The fish is ready. Let&#39;s all eat our share before we leave!</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> You can&#39;t fight if you&#39;re hungry. Besides, you all look as young as chicks.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> And so you should eat! Hurry and eat!</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> Eat and make up for the exhaustion in your continuous battles! After that, we bogatyrs go to battle once more!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Y-yes!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;ll be digging in!</p><hr><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> ...Let&#39;s begin our meal as well then! Fish, hm...I&#39;d like some meuni\xE8re with it...</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong> You called?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Not you, Morningcall!

The Director and Meuni\xE8re are busy driving the Border and keeping an eye on the perimeter.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I&#39;m the only one who can talk right now. Is that fine?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Yes. I&#39;d like to continue our conversation from earlier.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> First, Lady Da Vinci. Your guess was correct, as expected.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Both the war-beasts and the Dead Zones are for the purpose of killing mankind.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> The question is, why is this the case?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> In a completely blanked world, where the Russian Lostbelt has disappeared,</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> this land of Tunguska is still full of life.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> This two-faced Special Territory, existing similarly to a Lostbelt while being completely different.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> A land overflowing with unknown plants and animals exulting life. A wasteland of endless battles slaughtering life.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> And generally speaking, a grotesque biosphere that doesn&#39;t recognize any existence related to the Human Order, and refuses any connection to the Throne.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> A world that despises humanity despite not rejecting them, but also overflowing with violence against them.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> What is this place, exactly?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Allow me to state my conclusion. There can be no mistake, this place is\u2014</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> \u2014somebody&#39;s inner world. A Reality Marble.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> !</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!?</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong> (Chewing happily)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> A Reality Marble...</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...the ultimate achievement in magecraft.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> A superlative magecraft technique creating another world inside the real one.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The effect varies depending on the user. But it allows things normally impossible in reality to occur, as a commonality.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Heroic Spirits sometimes use them as Noble Phantasms, but magically speaking, their value is absurd!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Somebody&#39;s inner world. The embodiment of their mentality.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Without a doubt, another world apart from the one we know.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> That is what this place is.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> The world\u2014of Tamamovitch Koyanskaya.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> A paradise safe from outsiders...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> A hell of human-killing weapons walking the earth...</p><hr><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gDQNGMZ.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> If this is how her spirit is...if it is what shapes this world, then...</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/IFSG5Az.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Refutal of the existence of mankind, and scathing cynicism towards civilization.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The hypothesis makes sense if you take into account what Koyanskaya&#39;s said and done up to now.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Your conclusion is probably the correct one. But there&#39;s still another question to answer.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Normally, a Reality Marble can&#39;t be maintained for a long period of time, right?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Were it used in the real world, that would be the case. But there are ways around that.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> When it&#39;s deployed inside the body of a single being!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> The whole Special Territory, the outer shell included, is most likely Koyanskaya herself.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> She extended her Saint Graph ad infinitum, and enshrined herself within the old Tunguska forest area.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Foooooou...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I see...that make sense.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> For a while, I thought this was a variant of a Singularity or a Lostbelt.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> In any case, we&#39;d be better off thinking of this as a Reality Marble from here on.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> After all, the theme is far too consistent!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> On the one hand, abundant life! On the other, boundless carnage!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> And both of them rejecting humanity!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> ...far too straightforward for a Singularity using a Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> There&#39;s no way that vixen would be so up-front about her wishes.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> And it&#39;s too unnatural to be reached as a what-if history.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hold on a second.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I have to object to that one. If it is an alternate history, then there should be one without humans.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> If that is the case though, it still doesn&#39;t account for the arbitrary Dead Zones.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> ...good guess.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Now I&#39;ll prove why I think it&#39;s so unnatural. Please think back, everybody.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Do you recall the animals you saw at the canyon in the Life Zone?</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/lXHO3i3.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Y-yes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The new species, parents and children\u2014</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/MUzpv2j.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Those were not parents and children.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh...?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Siblings.</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong> What?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> All life here is related, in a manner of speaking.

Wait a second here.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Are you saying you can do that yourself? Unassisted?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Hahaha...well, it&#39;s a bit embarrassing, you see.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> I had a lot of time to kill before meeting you all, and so I made use of many fangshu.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> So I can say this definitively, okay?</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/OByH2a8.png" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZzBJ92e.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> The creatures of this world don&#39;t interbreed.

Like on the fish from before...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> They&#39;re just for show.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> But there is a life cycle itself. One called the food chain.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Birth, life, death.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Eat and be eaten, kill and be killed.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> The difference is\u2014</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> All the life comes from just one source: Koyanskaya, ruler of this territory.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Everything, everything here is created in a fixed state.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> The same natural cycle of the food chain.The same cycle of brutal, violent slaughter.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Both of them are equally the same.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Nothing more than what is created by Koyanskaya, and what eventually returns to her.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> This world is definitively in a closed state.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> In some ways...even moreso than a Singularity or a Lostbelt.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/aWJgice.png" alt=""></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Even if that&#39;s the case...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> These animals and plants have lives, don&#39;t they...?</p><hr><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Yes, they most certainly do.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Philosophically speaking, I couldn&#39;t say. But from a purely biological standpoint,</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> all the organisms in this Special Territory have lives of their own.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> They are alive. Therefore death also exists here, and the cycle of life and death continues.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> But as for right now\u2014</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> They have no egos or sense of self.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh...?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Like I said earlier, I had a lot of time to kill, and I can assure you I&#39;ve tested it many times.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> They have no ego. They have no self.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> I suppose that means that there&#39;s no need for life that grows, evolves, or inherits traits from before.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> At the very least, for the shadow of Daji\u2014</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> \u2014for Koyanskaya, the ruler of this territory.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You&#39;ve called her a &quot;shadow&quot; several times now.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Her scent is a little different from Daji herself.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Tamamovitch Koyanskaya is an alter ego of Daji, the Golden White Face. A bunrei subvariant,</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> or perhaps an exaggerated form of her as a Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> My word.

No, not a chance.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> However thin the shadow is cast, Daji would never do such a thing!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> And so...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Dear me, what a disgrace! Taigong has totally failed!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Tamamovitch Koyanskaya is something else. She is not Daji!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Her existence should be as a counterfeit of the Golden White Face.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> ...Wh-What?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Th-Then what is the juvenile Beast-class that we&#39;ve been closing in on?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> You think Tamamovitch Koyanskaya has no connection to the nine-tailed huli jing who is the Golden White Face fox?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> It&#39;s true that they resemble one another, but I think they are fundamentally different existences.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> !</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> S-So that&#39;s where we&#39;re at...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> 3,000 years ago, Daji was behind the ruin of the Shang dynasty. There&#39;s no question she was the Golden White Face, true?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Undoubtedly so, she was a thousand-year fox spirit.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Lady N\xFCwa had decreed a hasty eradication for the Shang, but that demon went on to torment the people according to her evil nature.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> The beast fatale, a powerful and ferocious thing bearing nine tails. For that was Daji.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> ...Then I came here.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> I was certain the reason for my coming to this world was to eradicate the beast fatale.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> To consign the shadow of Daji to death, in accordance with Lady N\xFCwa&#39;s wishes from the Empyrean realm.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Or so, I had come to earnestly think\u2014</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> What other purpose was there!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So you mean,</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Tamamovitch is...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> not a Tamamo...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai, you recall hearing from Tamamo-no-Mae herself that she isn&#39;t Daji.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Hm? What are you talking about? How does one taxonomically classify the Tamamos?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> I would appreciate you not confusing me any more than I already am...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You don&#39;t look so good, Director. Just calm down a little.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> Here, drink some water.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> O-Oh...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> (Gulp, gulp)</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Pwah...Oh, that&#39;s good...</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> Water, drawn from the clear waters of the Life Zone.It&#39;s cold, and so clear that it shimmers under the sunlight.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> One sip will make you feel better. Have another.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> (Gulp, gulp)</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Pwah...Oh, I feel somewhat calmer...</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> I should say so.</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong> (Stares unblinkingly)</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> What?</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong> Nothing, just that you make a good caretaker. Almost to a motherly degree.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> I can do most things, you know.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> ...that leaves room for the few that I can&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> Oh, you want some water too? Here.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou fou.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Okay, that&#39;s all well and good. The Director seems to have settled down, so shall we move on?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Yeah, let&#39;s straighten things out.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Firstly, we are certain\u2014she is not some alter ego or bunrei of Daji.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Nor anything along the lines of a figure exaggerated to the height of a Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> I am adamant on that point. Despite that, and towering over these facts...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Koyanskaya is imitating the Golden White Face, that much is certain.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> We have enough on which to base this, right?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Yeah.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> We&#39;re counting on you this time, Heroic Spirit Taigong. This is no place to formulate a plan on shaky grounds.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Let me try to redeem myself for that mistake. Yes, my arrival should somewhat be evidence.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Her personality and behavior, the differences in effect my arts had on her. Not to mention,</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> the tail.</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong> And what a tail.</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong> (Shaking)</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou fou.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Speaking first of the amount of magical energy in her possession, it&#39;s strange for her not to have already reached a mature form.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> The alter ego and familiars we&#39;ve fought have made use of that much power.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Yet she has not yet reached maturity. But why is that?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Because the model case for her self-evolution is the Golden White Face, whose nine-tailed form is her ideal body\u2014</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Therein is my rationale.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Oho...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Aiming to be the new nine-tails...Yes, that might be convincing reasoning.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> ...On top of that, and this is just a theory.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> The tails she collected could very well be the Lostbelts themselves.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yagas or Kalis could&#39;ve stood in as tails?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> She used the Lostbelts to gather her tails?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> The process of turning the life forms of the Lostbelts into her familiars would render each existence\u2014every piece of foreign intelligence into tails.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Wh-What do you mean?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> We might be jumping the gun here. Would you care to explain?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> That&#39;s how it seemed from the alter ego, with a ludicrous mass to her Saint Graph.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> From what I could tell, it currently weighs hundreds of thousands of tons. A mass like a gargantuan monster.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That much...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> A giant monster...!?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> It&#39;s not so easy to gauge at a glance, like power from the amount of magical energy...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> But that mass is her weight of existence!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Isn&#39;t it possible that she&#39;s been extracting the information of the six Lostbelts via her Lost Familiars, making it into tails, and expanding?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Six Lostbelts?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> We counted five tails before.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> If you&#39;re talking about the alter ego that emerged at Olympus, it wouldn&#39;t be so strange for it to have five tails.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Her main body may still only have five tails.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Oh?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> One of them was lost in Britain.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The fight at Britain&#39;s Lake District.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Since Muramasa said that one of the spiritual cores was destroyed there by M\xE9lusine.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Mm-hmm.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Although, even with the Beast Saint Graph...it stands that her growth stage had already reached the count of six tails.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Still, these assumptions notwithstanding...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> A Saint Graph of so huge a mass will takeproportionate effort to utterly kill and burn out.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Which isn&#39;t to say it&#39;s equivalent to destroying six Lostbelts, but it will take spending a good amount of resources.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...I see...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Hrm...so we need firepower of that degree?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> I&#39;m disappointed we haven&#39;t finished the Excalibur Cannon. I even prepared new sunglasses for the occasion...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Taigong?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Yes?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Oh, you&#39;ve only now noticed?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Your expression looks strangely better, Taigong. Could it be you still have a card yet to play?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Well...</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> Say it, Taigong.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> I know you&#39;re afraid to reveal anything after you made such a terrible blunder.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> Even so, I think you should reveal anything you&#39;ve kept secret!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> I-I&#39;d hate for you to talk about me like some kind of schemer...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> ...Yes. Yes, I do, after a fashion!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> There&#39;s definitely a way to stop Koyan!</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong> Wow, there is!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou fou!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> If you have the means, then it&#39;s uplifting!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I was honestly conflicted since she can generate unlimited war-beasts and Lost Familiars.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It&#39;s turned out that she can mobilize them one after the other, right? In such a situation...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Continuing to head for the center of the territory will only play into her hands.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I honestly wondered if we should abandon that strategy, and considered leaving the territory with all our power.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That made me hesitate\u2014</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Morningstar! Reset the Border&#39;s course for the center of the territory!</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong> Already laid in! I knew that would be in line with your habits, Commander!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Mm.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> ...No, hold on. Wait first for your commander&#39;s orders before you act, all right?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> As for me, I don&#39;t want to run away from this. I need to go to Koyanskaya&#39;s castle.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> The first Anti-Beast Noble Phantasm was a total dud, and the second not much better.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> But I promise, I will lead you to the solution!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> There is a way!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Mm. If you say as such openly, can we rely on you?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Please leave it to me.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> I removed certain properties of the Anti-Beast Noble Phantasm based on targeting Daji&#39;s shadow...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> But there are countermeasures for any monster, no matter how mighty or huge beyond reckoning!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> It&#39;s still a juvenile body. There are ways to plan for it.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Even if you don&#39;t know what it is, measures and countermeasures are always possible.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Though, I don&#39;t know for sure how well it will work\u2014</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> \u2014the means are there.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong></p><h4 id="serious-face-serious-face" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#serious-face-serious-face" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Serious face!

As they have no shared characteristics,</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> it&#39;s said no two are equal, but there&#39;s no such thing as too much caution.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Judging from her words and actions before, it seems she can monitor all events inside the Reality Marble.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> ...Yes, the Reality Marble.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> My final move rests on the fact that this is a Reality Marble.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Now, once again.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Mumble, mumble, mumble...</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong> Okay, we&#39;re about to enter the Dead Zone.</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong> All combatants, intercept approaching war-beasts at your discretion.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Huh?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Can&#39;t we go take the safest possible way through the Life Zone?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> We&#39;ve concluded the analysis of the Lost Familiar patrol routes, and can make a breakneck charge through there.</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong> Look at the operations map!</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong> The center of the territory lies within the Dead Zone!

The CEO will be seeing you now.</p><p><strong>PB:</strong> Please wait here. I pray your negotiations with the CEO will brighten the future of the world.</p><p><strong>PB:</strong> Well, not that I have much in the way of sentience and self-awareness...</p><p><strong>PB:</strong> Now, if you&#39;ll excuse me, PB shall be taking his leave.</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong> How courteous. We&#39;ll meet again if fate should will it, PB.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Thank you for being our guide, PB.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Goodbye, PB.</p><p><strong>PB:</strong> Thank you very much. Farewell, humans.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Truth be told\u2014</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> I am a little surprised.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> You are aware that you&#39;re inside a Reality Marble, right? I can spawn as many familiars and as many beasts as I see fit.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> In fact, I did just that. And you all had no other choice but to scamper away.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> The difference in strength between us is as clear as a financial statement. The fact that you boldly waltzed in here regardless means\u2014</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> That you&#39;re here to show off some fresh idea?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> No, no. First comes gratitude.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Thank you for starting this with a dialogue. And we too are surprised.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Of course, we are surprised that you&#39;re here to converse with us like this. But also surprised by PB&#39;s existence.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> To think you would create an entity capable of human speech in this domain.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> I figured that you\u2014</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> That you loathe everything about humanity.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Yes. That I do. However, disgust and appreciation are entirely separate matters.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> They will receive some respect from me, regardless of what lies inside, so long as the business they conduct is satisfactory.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Well, such a case is extremely uncommon. Hence, PB.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> I would also like to thank you for conversing with him as an equal.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> PB happens to be a favorite of mine.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (An extremely uncommon case...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (I wonder who that is...)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (It&#39;s hard to imagine it, but I am curious...)</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> (Fooufoou...)</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> An extremely uncommon case, is it? I see.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> It&#39;s rather disappointing that I&#39;m not this person, Miss Tamamovitch Koyanskaya.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Oh my\u2014</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Have you come to refer to me as Koyanskaya? I could&#39;ve sworn you were using another woman&#39;s name to refer to me.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Yes. I was mistaken.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> I must have unwittingly insulted you.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Taigong L\xFC Shang formally offers his apologies, Miss Koyanskaya.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Oh, dear\u2014</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Those heartfelt words of apology are touching indeed. However\u2014</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> As one hand reaches out to me, the other reaches for the gun hidden behind you, am I wrong?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> For that is how humans hunt. For that is the hidden nature of man. Isn&#39;t that right, Mister Taigong?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> There is no hidden nature. To miscall one is to disrespect them.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> I have heard that a fellow Chinese hero committed this same folly before, though he was of a Lostbelt.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> I cannot speak on his behalf...but we truly have given you a hard time.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> ...very well.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> I accept your apology. Courtesy is one of the few virtues that humans possess.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> No matter what may come after this, I will not desecrate the dead.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Oh, is something the matter?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> One of our few virtues. That may be so.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> We humans may have reigned as primates on this planet, but the cost of maintaining our culture and civilization is beyond imagination.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> We snuff out many lives just by living and going about our business.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> If monsters consuming far beyond the speed of their own reproduction are to be humanity&#39;s true nature. If that is to be our sin...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> then the virtues brought about by civilization, society, and cultural exchange are far too small in comparison.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Yes. Those few accomplishments hardly make up for that true nature.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Apes who transformed their ecosphere from a circle of circulation into one of consumption...</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> No, that would be an insult to apes. As far as they are concerned, humanity may as well be alien life forms.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> You who feel guilt towards the higher order of animals that call this planet home, yet mark them for consumption all the same without exception.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> ...well, the fact that the opposite is also true is what makes humanity incorrigible though...</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> They truly are loathsome, considering both their virtues and vices.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Seeing how you&#39;ve traversed this world, I&#39;m sure you already know.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> The reason I exist?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Of what I do behind the Alien God&#39;s back while I supported its invasion?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You long for humanity&#39;s downfall.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> ...Fufu.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You want to witness the extinction of humanity.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Oh, spot-on\u2606</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> My objective, my ideal, is without a doubt the &quot;total annihilation of humanity&quot;.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> But if I were asked whether I wish to annihilate them with my own hands, I would say no.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> I&#39;ll leave the hard work to the Alien God.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> I could not care less about Pan-human History and the Lostbelts.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> I simply want to watch and enjoy.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> A swarm of conceited, paltry egos screaming, whimpering, and floundering\u2014</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Being whittled away without ever achieving anything, until the last of them dies in tears.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> To see that with my own eyes is my wish. Aesthetics, shall we call it?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> After all, I wouldn&#39;t be able to make an assessment otherwise, would I?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Of how empty, small, and revolting the last thing humanity leaves behind is.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Creatures who will expire in a few millennia despite gaining wonderful technologies and knowledge.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Multiplying without caring for their brethren, without healing the earth\u2014</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> An ecosphere where the ignorant strong ultimately trample on the ignorant weak.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> I will record its final moments and put it on auction for everyone else in this universe.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> &quot;Just how much worth does this civilization have?&quot;</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Isn&#39;t it just exciting? I wonder what its final price will be?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> A trillion? A hundred million? Ten thousand? A thousand? No, I can only hope to get any value out of it.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> In the end, trash is trash. Is there someone who would pay even a single yen for it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (Stare silently)</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> ... ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (Silently bite lip)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> ...H-Hmm.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Good grief, this is\u2014</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> Aha!</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> From what I&#39;ve heard, you&#39;re an extremely heartless fiend.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> I thought I could find common ground with you after seeing what life was like in the Life Zone,</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> But you&#39;re just\u2014just\u2014</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> How do I say this?

I haven&#39;t introduced myself yet, have I?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Thank you for the courtesy.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> I did check, but it was too much of a hassle to ask for each name, so that helped.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Mister Taigong. And dignitaries of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Shall we wrap up our conversation here?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> I am tired after what happened with Cernunnos, but you played nice with PB, so...</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> I was touched by that, and so I ended up playing along with this conversation.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> But this is as far as that goes.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> It is true that our relationship thus far has been that of &quot;friends&quot;, but let&#39;s end that here too.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> \u2014Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Friends...how come?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Oh dear...to think you hadn&#39;t realized.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Your priority is to excise the Fantasy Trees. My priority is to collect life forms.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> We were never enemies.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> I was living it up in the Lostbelts as a tourist. In that regard, we are cut from the same cloth.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> \u2014</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> But not this time.

In either case, that was a bad call for those calling themselves primates.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> It will no doubt be a fitting end for ones who have erred repeatedly like you.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> I shall only respond to ephemeral actions with ephemeral games.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Oh\u2014there is no need to cry out the Beast&#39;s name.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> For it is out of spite that I name myself before humanity.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...magical energy levels, rising rapidly!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> This is where the real deal begins.

Is it going to devour even a Xian-class defense!?</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> Here it comes, huh?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> She should have manifested in her six-tailed state! I won&#39;t be able to tell you how formidable it is without seeing it firsthand, though!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> I will cast a spell to shield the mind, so please don&#39;t lose your wits!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> It is a Beast meant to kill humans.

What makes you think so, Daoshi?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> From the skies...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> No, allow me to rephrase that for accuracy&#39;s sake.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> You are...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> You are the power of the explosion that pierced the land of Tunguska. You are the lamentations of the animals that perished.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> You are the pain that nature felt. You are its scream. You are the wailing of an abrupt death.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> You are, so to speak, the curses and anguish seared into the land of Tunguska.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> You are the beast formed from their union.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> \u2014Miss Tamamovitch Koyanskaya.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> You are, so to speak, the curses and anguish seared into the land of Tunguska.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> You are the beast formed from their union.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> \u2014Miss Tamamovitch Koyanskaya.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The explosion of Tunguska...then that means that she&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The embodiment of a concept...?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> The Tunguska event made flesh!?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> N-No, well...it is hard to rule that out entirely.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> There have been cases of concepts becoming Heroic Spirits, and it can even be said that tinkering with concepts is the ultimate goal of magecraft.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> You can call it a phenomenon all you want, but as far as human history is concerned, a colossal disaster of global scale is not an event it can afford to ignore\u2014</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> In other words, it wouldn&#39;t be a stretch if it became a Ghost Liner!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yep. The director&#39;s spot-on. There&#39;s no doubt that Koyanskaya is a Servant.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The fact that she&#39;s an Alter Ego is proof of that, since they&#39;re modelled after a &quot;different aspect&quot; of a preexisting Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That is, of course, assuming Taigong is correct. Though I do believe he&#39;s certain of it, considering he&#39;s made this sort of assertion...?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Well, I guess I am.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> That is the answer I grasped from the spiritual core of her Saint Graph. It was a technique with plenty of irksome activation conditions,</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> but I did manage to trigger it. I mean, it scared the daylights out of me.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Oh, by the way, Fujimaru was the one who gave me the final hint.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Did I do something...?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> ...since when did you take up magecraft?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> It&#39;s called fangshu. You could also refer to it as sage arts.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> It is rather unlike Western magecraft in terms of versatility. It requires a lot of effort, but depending on how you set it up, well. You see,</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> quite a lot of things can be done with it.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Huh. Like eavesdropping on a lady&#39;s secrets?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Yes, indeed.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> I had a look at your true nature.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Let&#39;s give you an example, Miss Koyanskaya. You\u2014</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> don&#39;t give a damn about humanity, do you?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> !</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong> Heh.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> ...w-wait. That can&#39;t be right.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> That atypically savage cruelty! It is a show of sadistic obsession with humanity!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> I-If she doesn&#39;t give a damn, then why would she...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Yes. It&#39;s precisely because she couldn&#39;t care less that it becomes a routine for her.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> I&#39;m sure she does hate and loathe humanity. But not to the extent that she will act personally to cause human extinction.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> She will mess with it, at best...of course, that in itself will result in a lot of bloodshed.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> But when push comes to shove, finding amusement in witnessing humanity&#39;s downfall is all the interest in it she can muster.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> That&#39;s because the truth is that she couldn&#39;t care less.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> ...s-so what&#39;s the truth? What do you have to say for yourself, Tamamovitch Koyanskaya!</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong> Oh dear, giving us the silent treatment?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Grngh.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> \u2014In 1908 AD, a massive explosion occurred in the Tunguska forest zone.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Light and heat came as a result of the great explosion. A shockwave. Those final moments that came all too suddenly...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> I&#39;m sure there must have been animals who believed it was gunfire brought about by human hands.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> But the truth of it was that their lives were snuffed out by that explosion.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Those grudges against humanity simmering deep within you. They are, simply put, residual thoughts that clung to you...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Nothing more than a texture.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> That is why you cannot bring yourself to be serious about human extinction.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Anyone who lays eyes on this ecosphere will understand what you long for.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> That&#39;s right. You have something that takes precedence over human annihilation.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> I&#39;m sure you understand it too, don&#39;t you, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Yeah.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...It&#39;s probably because of that incompatibility\u2014</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> ...Honestly. The Human Order&#39;s Counter Force, I take it?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> I have perused the records of the Seventh Singularity. It was truly repugnant.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> It had the gall to prepare all these Heroic Spirits to use against me.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Or is that diversity, by any chance, Pan-human History&#39;s greatest asset?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Yes, I do feel sorry about that. After all, it has been over 10,000 years.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> We have all the right people in the right places on our side. A whole assemblage of specialists to ward off calamities.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> It would appear so. I was on the receiving end of that, and I lost.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Good grief. I suppose I reap what I sow and am getting my just deserts. My fault for incurring a needless curse and dragging my feet.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> I knew that if I wanted to kill you all, I would&#39;ve had to do it in person.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> ...oh well.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> It&#39;s not as though I&#39;ve suffered a loss or anything. So I hold no regrets and feel no bitterness over that.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> ...the fourth Beast.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Now that Primate Murder is no longer with us, I figured I&#39;d be able to take root as the fourth Beast,</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> but that turned out to be an ephemeral dream.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Could it be that this planet has it out for me?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> I yearned to be a Beast, but I couldn&#39;t make it. My dreams were shattered and I ended up being trampled by all you fine people from Chaldea...</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Yes, I&#39;m about to lose it with all this frustration and wrath\u2661</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Alrighty. Now that it&#39;s come to this, I guess I&#39;ll self-destruct and blow up the whole territory\u2606</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> !</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Woah, woah, woah! That&#39;s bad news! You may be saying it cutely, but I know you&#39;re serious, Koyanskaya!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> This woman is the type of lady who embodies the spirit of dragging everyone down with her!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Foou, foooou!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Hmm.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> If I may offer a suggestion\u2014</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Shall we put an end to this? This Beast candidate and Alien God apostle business. All of it.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> This hounding Chaldea and human history business too. We&#39;ll put it all behind us.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Huh?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Hmm?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> I hereby propose a third option, one that does not demand the death or extinction of either party.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> So I invite you to accept this, Miss Koyanskaya.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> After all, you couldn&#39;t care less about humanity, do you?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Do you not think it&#39;s absurd to stake your life over something you couldn&#39;t care less about?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> ...I see. You have a point.</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong> Old man!?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> N-N-No, that&#39;s not what I meant. I am definitely not referring to how my feelings have changed or anything!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> I simply came to this conclusion as a result of valuing my own life! The entirety of this domain is Koyanskaya, is it not?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> If she self-destructs, we&#39;d have nowhere to run! In that case, reconciliation ought to be a viable path!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Besides\u2014besides,</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> ...this is not a Lostbelt. It&#39;s not a Lostbelt.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Our interests aren&#39;t mutually exclusive. There&#39;s no reason why we ought to be killing each other...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> There&#39;s no need to come to blows...if we can settle this through dialogue.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Isn&#39;t that right, Fujimaru? No, young Master of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Not a ruthless magus by birth, but an ordinary person bearing a heavy burden forced upon him by circumstances.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> You, of all people, should understand this...probably...far better than anyone else.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> \u2014Director Gordolf\u2014</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...Yes...Yes!</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong> Hnn. I get it, Goffie.</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong> Waging a war to pulverize the enemy can be such a pain in the ass!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> There must&#39;ve been a better way to phrase that!That just now was probably one of the three high points of my life, wasn&#39;t it!?</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong> Sorry, sorry. Looks like being straightforward isn&#39;t a strong point of mine.</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong> But I was serious about that, okay?</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong> The effort outweighs the reward, and all that remains are piles of corpses and rivers of blood. That&#39;s what a war of eradication is, no?</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong> That&#39;s what this proposal is, avoiding it, right? I didn&#39;t say anything wrong, did I?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> \u2014</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> \u2014Now this is a surprise.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Although I believe His Excellency Gordolf harbors double or even triple the grudge against me, does he not?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> I do! The mistakes I made at Chaldea, the countless crimes you committed! I will never forget them!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> But that is irrelevant! I will punish myself for my own foolishness!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> And you can settle your sins on your own!</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> How cold of you. You were third-rate to the very end, Your Excellency.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> I speak of you as a magus, of course.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Well, losers can&#39;t be choosers. Do what you will, whether that&#39;s killing me or sealing me.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> It&#39;s a half measure, either way. Even if you get rid of me, a second and a third\u2014</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> No. I&#39;m telling you we have a third option in store.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Pan-human History is cruel, that is a fact. There&#39;s never enough tickets to board the ship.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> I have a good eye for this, so I&#39;m well aware of all that.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Chaldea has no other path except that of killing these nonexistent lost probabilities, then moving forward.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> But that does not apply here. That is because your world does not belong in human history to begin with.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> ...Yes.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Yes. That&#39;s right, you really ought to accept my proposal.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> There is no need to kill each other. It&#39;s a simple matter.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> ...I don&#39;t get it. I have already planted my roots in Tunguska.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> It is the cradle for my eclosion into a mature Beast, and it will remain immobile once it has been laid out. Until I eclose.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Yet here I am. Utterly defeated.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> As long as I don&#39;t reach maturity, I cannot move a single inch from here.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> The Human Order. Pan-human History. Even if you reclaim those silly things...</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> This world of mine, sitting in a corner of Siberia, may cause an error in the restoration of the Human Order and get in your way, you know?</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong> ...Uh-huh.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That makes sense. As for the details of reclaiming and restoring Pan-human History,</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> there is room for argument.

That sounds about right!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> This is the third option I am proposing. To temporarily freeze her in space and time, then launch her into space!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Needless to say, we will set the technique such that it will automatically undo the space-time freeze once you have reached a safe haven!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> No, no, hold on just a minute! What are you prattling on about? Space-time freezing and space travel and\u2014</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Especially the former. You do realize that&#39;s the domain of True Magic, don&#39;t you!?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong></p><h4 id="allow-me-to-answer" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#allow-me-to-answer" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Allow me to answer!</h4><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Foou!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> I understand your misgivings, Director. Common sense dictates that having an entire swath of land travel through space is impossible!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> However, this is a Reality Marble. In the end, it is but the inner world of one life form.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> So, what does this imply?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That if we stop this forced expansion towards the surface occurring at this moment, and revert it back down to its original, humanoid size...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Yes!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> I&#39;m certain the mass itself won&#39;t change. But the size is, well, crucial.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Nevertheless, it is beyond my power to launch her into space like this.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> So I&#39;ll tinker with this space a little and shrink her down further. Down to palm size, to be more specific.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> And then I&#39;ll launch her into space!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Foufoou!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Now, about the space-time freeze, the fact that this is a Reality Marble works to our advantage.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Rather than meddle with space and time itself, we will merely slow the processes of a singular life form down to their utmost limit.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> We will have her enter a state that is similar to a space-time freeze!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> What do you say, Miss Koyanskaya?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> What do I...\u2014</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Humanity will, of course, be nonexistent beyond this planet.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Humanity will be nonexistent, but you are free to either aim for Beasthood or expand your own world.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Or you can be a little braver and bestow your children with self-awareness.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> The problem right now is that the planet&#39;s atmosphere is encircled by the branches of the Fantasy Trees\u2014</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> In that case, we just have to open up the sky.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Yes. Please do so.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> In other words...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We will cut down the Fantasy Trees and restore the Human Order, prime the timing for just ahead of the Human Order restoration,</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> and launch this world into space during that process\u2014Right?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Spot-on! Now then\u2014shall we begin?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Hold on a minute here! Hold on, hold on, I said hold on! I&#39;m being left behind as a spectator again!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Space-time freeze!? Space travel!?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> And we&#39;re not launching a rocket or a space shuttle, but a whole Reality Marble into space!?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> That&#39;s a funny joke you&#39;ve got there...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Or not! Calm down, ladies and gentlemen!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Even if you shrink her down, that&#39;s little more than window dressing! Taigong himself has said that her mass wouldn&#39;t change!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> The sheer energy it would require to launch an area of this scale into space! If reaching another celestial body is the objective here, you&#39;d need light-speed travel!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Even a generous donation of three magical energy cores from the Storm Border wouldn&#39;t be enough to cover it, alright!?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> It is possible. There is a precedent!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Would you all happen to be familiar with the story of Noah?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Noah...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> You know, the one with the ark...</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong> Oh, so close! I&#39;m so close but I can&#39;t put my finger on it! My head&#39;s all fuzzy!</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong> Then there&#39;s this raven that shows up at the end...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I take it you are referring to Noah from the Old Testament?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It is said that he built an ark and survived a great flood that engulfed the world, along with many other lives\u2014</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong> That&#39;s him!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Foou!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Frankly speaking, the two of us are fellow Grands. I&#39;ve learned a great many things from him!</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> Is that so?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Ahaha. So that&#39;s how it is! It sounds a lot more feasible when you put it that way!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Seriously!? Am I the only one feeling like I&#39;ve been bewitched by a fox!?</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong> Ahahahahaha. By those nine tails? How smooth of you, Goffie\u2661</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> T-That&#39;s not what I meant!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> I may not be as good as Noah is\u2014</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> But for what it&#39;s worth, I am still a direct disciple of Lord Yuanshi Tianzun! I am Taigong, one who stood in life as the equal of the Xians!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Let&#39;s give it a try, shall we? Even if it should prove impossible!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Nevertheless, I will require your cooperation.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> I will require you to stay put as I cast the spell.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> How does that sound, Miss Koyanskaya? Will you accept this proposal?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> ...of course I won&#39;t. Have you gone mad?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> I don&#39;t give a damn if you&#39;d like to wallow in narcissism and self-pity, but don&#39;t drag me into it.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> I still have a means of dragging you all down with me. If accepting your silly proposal is all I have left, I&#39;d much rather play that card.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> No. You&#39;ll accept, Koyanskaya.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Because this transaction will benefit both sides, right?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> ...Jeez, I must&#39;ve cozied myself up to your rabble a bit too much. I would&#39;ve never guessed you&#39;d take advantage of my sole principle.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Very well. I&#39;ll go along with that plan.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> The first Beast lies beyond dialogue.The second Beast lies beyond parting.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> And the fourth Beast will find a mutual answer, without ever taking up arms.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> \u2014Congratulations, you have successfully subdued a Beast. This fox&#39;s tail lies tucked between her legs.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Of course, that&#39;s done with great reluctance.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Fujimaru, I must once again ask you to channel your magical energy into me\u2014as much as you can muster!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Take all of it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> OK, give it your best shot!</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> Rejoice, Taigong! For I will applaud you while we&#39;re at it!</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> I&#39;m just basing this on my gut instinct here, but this is one of those techniques that&#39;ll make you go splat if you fail, right?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Ahaha. How sharp of you! I&#39;ll be counting on everyone&#39;s support.</p><p><strong>Hiryuu:</strong> Leave it to me, mysterious slit-eyed man!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Eh~...</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong> It&#39;s fine, it&#39;s fine. I&#39;ll help you if push comes to shove!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> I doubt I&#39;ll be in need of your assistance, but thank you for the vague sense of reassurance, Lady Ibuki-Douji.</p><p><strong>Si Bu Xiang:</strong> Mo.

On the contrary, I&#39;m grateful for your company, and...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Hahahaha. In any case, I&#39;d like to thank you for that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...thing is, something&#39;s been on my mind.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Oho. What would that be?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> There&#39;s no Evil of Humanity without love for humanity.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s what Abe-no-Seimei said, if I recall.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A record...from our previous operation in Heian-ky\u014D.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Seimei, that is to say, the Abe-no-Seimei who is famous for his talent? I see.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> So why did Koyanskaya become a Beast\u2014</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Oh, I see.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> A fair enquiry. Allow me to answer.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> I believe I told her that she cares nothing for humanity.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. You said you saw through her with your sage arts...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Yes. I saw right through her! That true nature of hers!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> ...how should I put it. That &quot;you don&#39;t give a damn about humans, do you?&quot; remark of mine.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> That was just an easy way of putting it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> !?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> An easy way\u2014</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou...!?</p><p><strong>Si Bu Xiang:</strong> Mo. Mo.</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong> Come now, Fou, don&#39;t act up now. You&#39;re startling Si Bu Xiang.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Hiryuu:</strong> Umm. Master Taigong, I take it that means you lied?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong></p><h4 id="indeed-it-does" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#indeed-it-does" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Indeed it does.</h4><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> (Serious face)</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Foufoou!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Owowowow! No, I didn&#39;t mean it in a bad way!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> It was by no means a malicious deception!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> The end justifies the means, as they say.For real, in this case.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The end...justifies the means?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Yes, it does indeed. It is true that she did loathe humanity,</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> so I used that as a starting point and, well, I cajoled her.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Still, truth be told, she didn&#39;t seem like she cared much for humanity, did she?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Both in words and actions.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> As for her not caring, that is the truth and yet an untruth, both a lie and a fact...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> She loathed humanity, and in fact, she had been looking forward to its extinction.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Nevertheless.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Considering her history\u2014</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> she must have loved them, in truth.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> People. Humans. Humanity.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> No matter how many forests they burn, no matter how many species that drive to extinction.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Even if she should conclude that our existences are incompatible, the primates known as humanity...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> are no more than a species that lives among nature. One that she loves.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> ...and there are animal species that seek to deepen their bonds with humanity.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> She did not deny that, she did not pluck that away either. And she did not ignore that.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> In other words, she loved humanity.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> ...and that makes her grudge all the more fierce. Her words and deeds longing for the ruination of humanity are nothing less than indisputable truth.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> The existence of the Dead Zone, an aggregation of hatred and bloodlust directed at humanity. The acquisition of her aptitude for human slaughter and the manifestation of her authority.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> They are all genuine.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> You do remember, don&#39;t you? She had even grown great horns indicative of her status as a fully developed Beast.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> She did have those horns\u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...that&#39;s right. We did confirm the formation of large horns on her head.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (Nod silently)</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Thus, we can conclude this!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> \u2014Koyanskaya harbors a love for humanity within her!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Yet at the same time! She also harbors hatred and bloodlust! To the point she herself has grown sick of humanity!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Foufoou...!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Love in spite of hatred. That dichotomy is by no means uncommon.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> It is not one exclusive to Beasts, for we humans often possess the same.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> You may or may not be aware of it though.</p><p><strong>Nikitch:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Yes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The Beasts we have encountered so far...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> have at least had such an inclination.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> \u2014</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So you&#39;re saying that Koyanskaya</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> no longer wished to hate anymore?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No longer wished to hate\u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. I feel like I understand, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> She no longer wished to hate anymore. I believe that is why she chose to leave for the sea of stars.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Not for the sake of humanity...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...no, for the sake of all animals, including humanity.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Oh, there&#39;s my cue.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Foufoou!</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Dear me, you&#39;re bidding me farewell? How cute.</p><p><strong>Si Bu Xiang:</strong> Mo. Mo.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Yes indeed. I will be sure to return. Hahahaha, of course I wouldn&#39;t do something like using underhanded tricks to stay behind.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> It&#39;s impossible with this Saint Graph anyway...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> But in the end, with this kind of timing, it&#39;s hard to tell which one it is.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Umm...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What do you mean by hard to tell?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> I will be heading back to the Throne. But for what reason?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> A stray Servant, walking around without a Holy Grail...even though the special territory has been eliminated.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Has the Human Order finally called for my retrieval?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Or is it simply because I used a Xian-class greater sage art, causing the spiritual core of my Saint Graph to shatter?</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Which one is it, I wonder?</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong> Hmm...</p><p><strong>Ibuki D\u014Dji:</strong> No way to tell! You&#39;ve got a point, this kind of timing makes it hard to know.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Well, I accept it either way. I have to uphold my duty, you see.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> Tamamovitch Koyanskaya. She...</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> if she happens to have modelled herself after Daji...the nine-tailed Golden White Face,</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> then our cultural region is partly to blame, all things considered.</p><p><strong>Taigong:</strong> I have to take responsibility for that.

And so it was that she left L\xFC Shang.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Thus the days went by\u2014</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> And the Shang dynasty, no longer favored by the heavens, collapsed. When the Zhou dynasty rose in its place, L\xFC Shang</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> was granted Qi as his fiefdom for his meritorious achievements as a tactician of the Zhou.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Then his former wife appeared before him and sought reconciliation.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> L\xFC Shang then poured water from a bowl and said this,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> &quot;Return this water to its bowl.

Festivals?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Do you perhaps mean those?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The bogatyr Dobrynya Nikitich won&#39;t be coming back anymore, and since we have no choice but to consider him dead,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> we must wed his young wife, who continues to wait for him, to a new husband. Not content with making such an absurd proclamation,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> they even went as far as to plan a wedding resembling a grand festival!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Do you mean those accursed and abominable things!?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> No. That would be strange.

After all, Nikitich can handle most anything.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...well.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...aside from parenting, that is.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> That&#39;s right, in 1908\u2014</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> In 1908, Dobrynya Nikitich was summoned in Russia.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> As a bogatyr of the Sun Prince, he is not wholly unrelated to the goddess of the sun.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The luminous goddess of the Orient gently celebrated that newborn life.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> O grotesque life, there is nothing to be afraid of. O screaming life, there is nothing to be afraid of.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> &quot;Even if you fall short of the sun in the heavens, you were born of the light. Therefore, you are a child of mine,&quot; she said.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Yeah. I see, that makes sense.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> And so went Nikitich. To the heart of that great explosion\u2014</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Overcoming all obstacles and enduring all hardships.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Distorted by the power of the fragment of rock that scorched the land of Tunguska,</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> there lay an incomprehensible creature.

I didn&#39;t even let Captain in on it.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Come now, anyone could have ventured a guess from your tone.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> You made no comments on the contents of Chaldea&#39;s operations, yet you had some rather strong opinions on our operational methods.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> It was all so that you could herd us into resolving those worrisome predictions only you foresaw, one after another.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> And now the greatest &quot;obstacle&quot;, Beast IV, has been ousted.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I had figured that Beast IV was your final worry...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> However, now that you claim there is &quot;one more&quot;, I may have misunderstood that last one.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> There can&#39;t be that many factors that exceed Beast IV.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> In which case, is it not natural to assume there is but one factor left?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Spot-on, broadly speaking. As expected of Sherlock Holmes.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> There is only one factor left I wish to sort out before we confront the Alien God.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> What might that be? To shed light on the Alien God&#39;s true identity and nature?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> No. That can only happen when we do confront the Alien God.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> This &quot;last worry&quot; of mine is something far simpler.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> It can&#39;t be helped if you don&#39;t understand!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> After all, this is a matter even you have overlooked, Holmes.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> I mean, I can&#39;t help but laugh. There&#39;s just no way you could&#39;ve seen this.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Since it slipped past even SHEBA&#39;s eyes, this is a problem neither of us could have done anything about!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> ...?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> ...welp, this is hardly the time to be cachinnating in despair.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> I&#39;ll leave the transport of the Saint Graphs to you, Holmes.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> On the off chance something happens, I&#39;m certain you can carry them to the Border, unlike me.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Right now, Chaldea Base is in an extremely perilous state.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> I cannot guarantee your safety with my Thought Acceleration and Memory Partition alone once ten minutes have passed.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Please hurry over to the Border and deliver the graphs to Da Vinci.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> You cannot guarantee my safety...would that mean your personal computing power is unable to ascertain the future?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> In which case, why not use TRISMEGISTUS II, the far more powerful computing unit?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> I can&#39;t use it. The machine behind me is just a paper tiger.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> I&#39;ve already moved its contents elsewhere, and they&#39;re currently being rebooted.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> \u2014! Then moving the Saint Graphs means...!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> It&#39;s exactly what you think it means. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re quick on the uptake.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> ...just between you and me. During this mission,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Chaldea should have suffered heavy casualties according to TRISMEGISTUS II&#39;s prediction.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> ...it even went as far as to conclude that &quot;the end result is defeat&quot;. Does this ring any bells, Holmes?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> ...of course it does. Reading those logs earlier chilled me to the bone.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Beast IV was harbouring a minus when it eclosed. It was the curse it incurred in Britain.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> That curse drove Koyanskaya into a corner, forcing her to undergo &quot;rapid maturation&quot;...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Yet their defeat was inevitable. And by that, I do not mean they were unable to defeat the Beast.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> They were destined to be annihilated the moment [\u2642 he /\u2640 she] set foot in that domain and fought at its epicenter.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Correct. Beast IV was ready to annihilate the entire domain. &quot;The hunters shall die with their prey&quot;\u2014</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> That was the nature of the trap it had set up.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> If survival means victory, Chaldea should have lost. However...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Yes. The Heroic Spirit Taigong and Director Gordolf&#39;s personal feelings.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> And a decisive word from the Master, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Those miracles were what stopped Koyanskaya from self-destructing.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> \u2014And so &quot;mutual slaughter&quot; turned into &quot;peaceful dialogue&quot;. As a result, there were no winners or losers.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Yep. A wonderful ending. Just what I expected of Chaldea!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> But...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> ...according to TRISMEGISTUS II&#39;s prediction, Chaldea will be annihilated today.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> A truly inevitable doom. Because the &quot;defeat&quot; comes after this.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> &quot;Warning. Warning.&quot;</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> &quot;Gravitational fluctuation confirmed 3,000 meters above the Wandering Sea.&quot;</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> &quot;Corresponding phenomenon sample: Olympus.Corresponding entity prospect: U-Olga Marie.&quot;</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> &quot;A pseudo-black hole formed via the manifestation of the Alien God.&quot;</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> !</p><p><strong>U-Olga Marie:</strong> An island that drifts along with the imaginary sea. A shadow cast by isolated space and time.</p><p><strong>U-Olga Marie:</strong> \u2014Hmph. An impressive idea, by Earthling standards.</p><p><strong>U-Olga Marie:</strong> Even an omniscient vision capable of observing the world of subatomic particles would fail to detect something that does not exist in this era.</p><p><strong>U-Olga Marie:</strong> They were never in the palm of my hand to begin with. Scouring the seas was naught but a meaningless endeavor.</p><p><strong>U-Olga Marie:</strong> In Earthling terms, it would be akin to unauthorized use of radio frequencies...or perhaps, stowing yourselves away in an attic?</p><p><strong>U-Olga Marie:</strong> However\u2014</p><p><strong>U-Olga Marie:</strong> This is the end for that wretched hideaway of yours! You see? It takes me but three seconds to find you, when I desire it!</p><p><strong>U-Olga Marie:</strong> It&#39;s little more than losing face, but I will still make you pay dearly for defying a god.</p><p><strong>U-Olga Marie:</strong> Fleas who have played with fire.O unsightly hornet&#39;s nest.</p><p><strong>U-Olga Marie:</strong> You will sink and vanish into the sea here!This is my decision as Prime Minister!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> &quot;The presence of the Alien God has been confirmed above the Wandering Sea. A gravitational sphere has been established.&quot;</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> &quot;The annihilation of the Wandering Sea is expected within 15 minutes. Evacuate the base at once.&quot;</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> &quot;Chaldea personnel are urgently requested to board the Shadow Border standing by at the dock.&quot;</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> &quot;I repeat. The presence of the\u2014&quot;</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, foou!</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong> You&#39;ve got to be kidding me! Isn&#39;t the Wandering Sea supposed to be impregnable!?</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong> The gravitational sphere means that thing, right? That pseudo-black hole from Olympus, right!?</p><p><strong>Meuni\xE8re:</strong> The Wandering Sea&#39;s a goner if that thing gets dropped, you know!? What&#39;ll happen to our base!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Is everyone here!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The Chaldea personnel are all accounted for! Everyone&#39;s on board the Shadow Border!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Holmes and Sion aren&#39;t here yet though\u2014oh!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I apologize for the delay, but the situation is dire. I will explain later.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I have the Saint Graphs. Let&#39;s leave at once.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> I would like nothing more than that, but where is Sion Eltnam!?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> I will blame her later for failing to foresee this while prattling on about &quot;predicting the future&quot;,</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> but she is now Chaldea personnel! We cannot leave her behind!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Hmm. I&#39;d love to have her hear that line just now, Director Gordolf.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> But let&#39;s prioritize our escape for now. Miss Sion has also suggested as much.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> It appears she will be joining us later.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> &quot;I will keep the Five Gates firmly sealed. Such is the responsibility of one who has rented the Wandering Sea.&quot;</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> She said it would take her 20 minutes to do so.\u2014I take it you understand the meaning of this?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Mister Holmes. That&#39;s...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> We have to go get her...!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> There&#39;s no need for that, Fujimaru. This is what she said to me.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Chaldea should give priority to escaping. I&#39;ll be sure to catch up with you.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Well, not right away. But I will be sure to make it in time for the final battle.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> After all, that&#39;s why I left the Atlas Institute.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Everything so far is, dare I say it, just as I calculated.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> I may look like this, but I am still a gamer. There&#39;s absolutely no way I&#39;m going to die before I get to see the ending, lololol.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Those were the words of an alchemist of Atlas. I consider them to be truthful.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Here we are as proof of that, well-prepared and boarding the Border.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Da Vinci and Captain are already on the Storm Border, ready to depart.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> From the start, she knew this would happen.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> In which case, she should have made preparations for her own escape as well.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> H...Hmm. You do...have a point...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> I&#39;d been wondering why we were suddenly told to pack...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> But I suppose it&#39;s high time the enemy also got serious, considering there&#39;s only one Lostbelt left.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> This would have happened to us, sooner or later...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Yes. We would have had to leave the Wandering Sea at some point. That is why the Storm Border came equipped with living quarters.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> She intended on making the Storm Border our base from the start.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> She said that Chaldea ought not to be affiliated with any faction, not to be under the protection of the Wandering Sea,</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> but an organization composed of those who live in the present, dedicated to preserving the Human Order.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> ...not affiliated with any faction...an organization composed of those who live in the present...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> ...hmm. That&#39;s it. That&#39;s exactly it, Administrative Advisor.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Meuni\xE8re! Fujimaru! Kyrielight!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Board the Shadow Border at once! The other personnel are already on board!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> \u2014Roger that!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Gate of Perpetuation, Seren, line disconnected. Gate of Progress, Eren, line disconnected.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Gate of Preservation, Genon, line disconnected. Gate of Servility, Fusilka, line disconnected.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Gate of Rebirth, Ganu, line\u2014</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Hmm?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> How may I help you, Professor? Did you perhaps forget something?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> \u2014Actually,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> what brings you here?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> What would bring a magus of the &quot;True Wandering Sea&quot; before a magus of the modern era?</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong> You find it strange? This is, after all, our final meeting.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong> I believe a direct, face-to-face greeting is common courtesy, no matter the era.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Oh...that&#39;s right. That is the case.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Unfortunately, our institute has been standalone for quite some time...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> The culture of meeting in person has all but died out. Replaced with meeting via screens, mirrors, threads, and the net.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> I, too, am a heretic at the Atlas Institute. The techniques imparted by the Eltnams...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Spiritron threads that directly hijack and access the brains of others...Etherlite, as it is called.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> And perhaps because my doting father spoiled me every chance he got,</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> I&#39;ve come to find meaning in &quot;skinship with other people&quot;.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> As a result, I&#39;ve become a positive person who refuses to use the all-too-convenient Etherlite technique.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> So your concern is most appreciated.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> I am grateful for this opportunity to exchange words with you in person.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> You&#39;re in THAT era, are you not? Shouldn&#39;t the cost of communication be absurdly high?</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong> It is indeed. It consumes enough magical energy to wipe out an entire continent.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong> But there was no other use for it regardless.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong> I have received permission from my mentor to splurge at least once for the future&#39;s sake.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Mentor...would you be referring to one of the magi who created the &quot;True Wandering Sea&quot;?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> I had heard Ganu no longer has anyone left. But it turns out there were two remaining, including you.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong> When it comes to these strange tales,</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong> the Gate of Rebirth ought to remain cut off from your era.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong> In any case, the Wandering Sea of 2017 will now vanish.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong> Whether or not I exist has nothing to do with Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Oh, so you won&#39;t scold me despite that my renting this place led to the island&#39;s decimation?</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong> Of course not. There is no such thing as decimation for the Wandering Sea. In the ancient past\u2014</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong> they built a workshop on a lone island in a distant sea to isolate themselves from the reach of both gods and mankind.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong> Thus, the entire zone vanished from the universe.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong> Drifting astray in space and time. Or you could say it went missing for eternity. No one can observe or interact with it.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong> Except\u2014for these Five Gates.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong> The Wandering Seas that manifest in each era are merely shadows cast by &quot;the Wandering Sea that once was&quot;.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong> Even if the Wandering Sea of 2017 should collapse, that will only be the case for 2017.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong> It will have no effect on either the past or the future. Nor will it affect the true form which has vanished.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> I see. I once thought that individual workshops lie beyond the Five Gates\u2014</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> But they are in fact Time Gates, are they not?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Gates that allow communication between the Wandering Sea prior to its disappearance and any era.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong> Correct. I too was once a magus who lived in the Common Era. Much like you.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong> I was beckoned by my mentor through the Gate of Rebirth and became a denizen of the other side.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong> You called yourself a heretic of the Atlas Institute. In other words, there is no place for you in this world.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong> The number of magi endowed with the teachings of the Wandering Sea are few.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> I am aware. It is said that applications are permitted only once a year, and only one applicant is selected.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong> Yes. However, there are not many who meet the standards required to join us.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong> But if one manages to be present when the gates open, if Mystery and fate align with them, anyone could make the grade.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong> At present, the gate to the Wandering Sea is open\u2014Sion Eltnam.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> No. While I am grateful for your words, I still have something I must do here.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Rest assured, I will ensure the gates are closed. Please feel free to return, Fabro Rowan.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> For you and the Wandering Sea, the Alien God may be an irrelevant matter far in the future...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> But for myself, [\u2642 him /\u2640 her], and Chaldea, this is a problem we must solve no matter what.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> So now is not the time for me to go there. If the gates are fated to open only in this very moment...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> I must conclude it was simply not meant to be. I&#39;ll try my luck with something else next time.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Thank you for all your cooperation.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong> I see. Then I will leave the cleanup to you.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong> ...one last thing.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong> We did not offer shelter to Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong> We offered you an opportunity, Sion. For that bizarre plan of yours.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> \u2014</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong> May you have a good journey, Sion Eltnam. Proceed as you wish...no, proceed as you have foreseen.</p><p><strong>Mage:</strong> Girl born of the black earth. Like a lone bird soaring across the underworld.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> ...? What an odd metaphor...I have nothing to do with birds or the underworld...</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Well, I suppose I&#39;ll find out someday. I&#39;d better get started on my work!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> There is no beauty in simply being destroyed. None at all! If we are to be destroyed either way, then self-destructing is the way to go. Self-destruct, it is!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Now then\u2014</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Let&#39;s see how durable the manifestation of the Alien God is!</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong> Wowow, the surface portion of the Wandering Sea is getting sucked into the gravitational spheeeeere!</p><p><strong>Nemo Marine:</strong> This is it, Captaaiin! If we wait any longer, we&#39;ll lose out on speeeed!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> I know!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> Tomarin, Kawata, Octavia, Chin, Kayan, Elrond, Marcus, Meuni\xE8re,</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> Fujimaru, Mash, Fou, Gordolf, and Holmes are confirmed aboard!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> Storm Border, scrambling! We will hereby leave these waters at full speed!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> T-That is fine and all, but what about that Olga Marie!? Won&#39;t she chase us!?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Why don&#39;t we launch a preemptive attack!? I mean, look at her. See how defenseless that little girl looks!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> No, the ship&#39;s armaments at present are not enough to damage the Alien God!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> If she chases us, then so be it! We&#39;ll outrun her!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> All hands, take your seats!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> Professor! Shipboard inertial protection at maximum output!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> Bow, transfer the temporal flow of the dimensional drilling to the stern. We&#39;ll use the gap recoil to accelerate!</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> This is going to be the fastest takeoff we&#39;ve ever had! I&#39;ll leave the steering to you!</p><p><strong>Nemo Professor:</strong> Yep, got i~t. I&#39;ve already done the calculations, so we&#39;re good to go~.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> Fire four Triton Engine units in parallel! Storm Border, taking off!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...what happened...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...did we pull out...?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> Yeah. No pursuit from the Alien God either.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> The ship has now left the North Sea and is headed towards the center of the Eurasian continent.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> We will continue to hold course eastward and head for the Pacific Ocean.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> Da Vinci, Holmes. Do you have any other questions?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> What happened to the Alien God? As we left, there was this intense flash of light...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That was the Wandering Sea&#39;s...no, Sion&#39;s counterattack.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Just like how the Alien God compresses ultra-dense matter to create a gravitational sphere,</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> she compressed the Wandering Sea to an infinitesimal degree, released it, and launched the resultant energy at the Alien God.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Did the Alien God not pursue us because of that damage,</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> or did it not realize we escaped? I can&#39;t tell for sure.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> I see. So she did not simply take it lying down, as expected of an alchemist of Atlas.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> But what do we do now? Sion Eltnam will be back, won&#39;t she?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Without her, we can neither maintain the Storm Border nor plan our operations with TRISMEGISTUS II, can we?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Fear not, TRISMEGISTUS II has already been ported over to the Storm.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> That&#39;s what the major end-of-year cleanup was for!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Well, it&#39;s nothing short of romantic having a massive computer inside an airborne warship!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Huh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Sion\u2014!?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Thank you for the &quot;we thought you exploded with the Wandering Sea&quot; reaction.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Apologies, but while I may look like this, I&#39;m actually a vam\u2014no, let&#39;s just say I have a unique constitution.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> I shut the Wandering Sea gates and activated the self-destruct sequence! Then I rendezvoused with the Storm Border on my own.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Well, I suppose you could call it existential probability manipulation. Please consider it in the same vein as Yu Mei-ren&#39;s dispersion.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I see. Alchemists who live in numbers do not see self-destruction...no, self-sacrifice as a good thing.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> What ought to be prioritized is not the subsequent result, but the calculations occurring in the present.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I take it...all your actions are done with self-interest in mind?</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Yes. The good you do for others is good you do yourself, as they say!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Lead with that, damn it! What an effective way of painting yourself in a positive light!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Don&#39;t make me worry for nothing! I, no, I am an ironhearted commander, so it&#39;s not as though it hurt me.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> But you should consider the feelings of the other personnel, seriously! We don&#39;t want to see any more sacrifices!</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> Oh. Is that so, folks?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yep. Reflect on that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> For real.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> But I&#39;m really glad you&#39;re okay.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...that&#39;s right, I think everyone else feels the same way.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m very glad to see you return safely. Good work on the dismantling of the Wandering Sea, Sion.</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> \u2014Are you serious?</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> ...well, I knew all along though. Sion&#39;s sturdier than the average Servant.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> More importantly, let&#39;s go over our plan now that we&#39;ve calmed down.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> From now on, Chaldea&#39;s operations will be conducted from the Storm Border.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> The Storm will fly haphazardly across the earth so that we won&#39;t be spotted by the Alien God.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> We will make landfall only for refuelling and maintenance.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> The Storm may be an outstanding vessel, but even it will reach its limit eventually without a port.</p><p><strong>Nemo:</strong> One more large-scale operation&#39;s the limit. I&#39;d like you to keep that in mind.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Understood. There&#39;s only one Lostbelt left either way.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Once the decisive anti-Alien God technique is complete, Chaldea will assault the seventh Lostbelt.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> \u2014We will engage U-Olga Marie, the self-proclaimed &quot;Alien God&quot;, in combat.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Will that do, Commander Gordolf and [\u2642 Mister /\u2640 Miss] Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> M-Mm. So we&#39;re finally in the endgame.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Very well, let&#39;s do it! But only after we&#39;ve made every preparation possible!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Of course.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> While the tuning of the Holy Sword is no doubt important, we mustn&#39;t forget to analyze the Alien God either.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Is the Alien God really Director Olga Marie? What is up with that form?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Right now, &quot;defeating&quot; her is the only option we have. But as we deepen our understanding of the enemy, other options may present themselves.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Just like they did with Koyanskaya. Isn&#39;t that right, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Right!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> In that case, we&#39;ll have to get used to our new surroundings.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Let&#39;s split up and work to make the Storm Border a better base than ever before.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It looks like Sion&#39;s built us a new facility too, no? Things are sure to get busier from here on out~.</p>',3222);function w(b,k){const e=a("ExternalLinkIcon");return i(),g("div",null,[h,l,t("p",null,[t("a",u,[d,n(e)])]),m,t("p",null,[c,t("a",y,[n(e)])]),f])}var I=s(p,[["render",w],["__file","tunguska.html.vue"]]);export{I as default};
