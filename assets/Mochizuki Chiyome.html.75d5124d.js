They Coil Around Me</h2><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Oh, hello.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> What a coincidence, running into you here.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> I think this might be the first time for us to bump into each other without anyone else being around. Do I have that right?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Usually you look away or hide in Master&#39;s shadow the second you see me.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Let&#39;s see, I think your name was Para\xEDso...? No, no, wait, I&#39;ve got it. You&#39;re that Kouga Mochizuki clan ninja.</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> Ulp...</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> A-ah...ah...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Now what was your name again? Mochizuki...Chiyojo? Chiyome? Mmm... Chiyome&#39;s muuuch cuter, so let&#39;s just go with that.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> What&#39;s your class, Chiyome? Assassin?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Why, what a coincidence! Mine too! Will wonders never cease.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> After all, you and I are both clearly...</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> A-aaah... Aah... Ulp...</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> (She&#39;s...looking at me...) P-please...stop... No... No...</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> ...Forgive...me...</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> My, my... She really doesn&#39;t care for little old me, does she?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Why, it makes me feel like a frog staring down a snake.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> ...Hmm?</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> Um, did you want to talk to me about something?</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> I&#39;m in a bit of a hurry. I have to bring my sisters their meal.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Oh, don&#39;t worry, this will only take a moment. You see...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> (Mumble, mumble... Whisper, whisper)</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> What, is this supposed to be a secret? Hmm... Are you sure she&#39;d like that?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> You&#39;re a god too, right? Come on, can&#39;t you do an oni a favor? Pretty pleeease?</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> ...Nnn... I&#39;m not sure... But, well... Hmm...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> It&#39;s not like this would be your first time, right?</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> Nnn...</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> ...Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Chiyome?</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> Yes, Master. It is I, Mochizuki Chiyome, Kouga Jonin.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Shuten asked me to come here...</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> I-is that so.</p><hr><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> I am here on behalf of the Lancer, Lady Medusa, who asked me to come to the Command Room.</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> But, I see she is not here... What is going on?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Good evening, all. You see, I&#39;m what&#39;s going on!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Lovely night, isn&#39;t it? Really gets my blood pumping, if you know what I mean.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Mind helping me take the edge off with a bit of exercise? Chaldea&#39;s got that \u201Csimulator\u201D thing, yes?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You want to do combat training?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Yeah, that sounds good. Seeing how we&#39;re the same class and all, I was hoping she could give me some pointers.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You mean, you want to spar with Chiyome?</p><hr><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Sounds like Master&#39;s on board with it. What do you say, Chiyome? Care to join me?</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> !</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> I-if Master commands it...I would happily go to the ends of the earth.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Fufu, that sounds like a yes to me! That&#39;s the spirit. All right then, let&#39;s get started!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> ...Snakes, snakes, snakes. So many snakes!</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> Wh-wh-what is the meaning of this!?</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> There are so many snakes! It&#39;s like you&#39;re...purposefully...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Oh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Are you afraid of snakes, Chiyome?</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> I-I...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You&#39;re doing this on purpose, aren&#39;t you, Shuten?</p><hr><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Not a big fan of snakes, are you?</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> !!!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Chiyome of the Kouga Mochizuki clan. You use your curse sooo expertly, yet you don&#39;t seem at all accustomed to it.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> What a waste. Don&#39;t you know how hard your ancestors worked to pass it down across generations?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> They sure didn&#39;t go to all that effort just so you could cringe in terror at an illusion of a snake...</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> I... That&#39;s...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Hold up.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Are you trying to torment Chiyome?</p><hr><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Fufufu, you stay out of this, Master... or I just might have to eat you.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Come on, you know how it is.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Humans love overcoming their weaknesses, right? Not me, of course. The very idea fills me with dread.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> But you&#39;re a human-based Heroic Spirit, right, Chiyome? Don&#39;t you HAVE to overcome your weakness? Don&#39;t you want to?</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> I-I... I have no fear of...snakes...</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> Indeed, I have no weaknesses whatsoever!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Oh, really? How silly of me. My bad. I&#39;m relieved to hear that.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Then we can keep going without worrying about needing to hold back.</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> ... ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Chiyome.</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> P-please do not worry about me. I have no issue with this whatsoever.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> We can always stop the simulator if you want.</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> D-do not be ridiculous! I was already swallowed up by a snake long ago! I have nothing to fear from one now!</p><hr><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> All right then, here goes nothing...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> I do hope you&#39;ll forgive me if I end up squashing you like a bug.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Chiyome!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Here she comes! Hang in there!</p><hr><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> Yes, Master...!</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> I, Mochizuki Chiyome, shall carry out your orders to the letter!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> Snakes, snakes, and more snakes... I have had enough!!!</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> Just...</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> Just wh-what do you want with me!? Fine, I confess! I have been terrified of snakes since I was a child!</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> But so what!? What would you know of the pain and suffering that comes from being born with the curse of Orochi!?</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> How could you possibly know what it is like to be burdened with the knowledge that you will one day grow scales and become a serpent!?</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> That day may be today...or tomorrow...or any of the days yet to come!</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> Or worse, perhaps that fate will not fall to me, but to my child, or my grandchild, or my distant descendant...</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> But regardless of who is made to endure that fate, it is one that all of Orochi&#39;s shrine maidens born to the Mochizuki clan must bear!</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> Even in death, in this new, transient life as a shadow, my curse has not been lifted...</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> Do you have any idea how this feels!?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Hmm.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Nope!</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> !!!</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> Then cease your torment of me and allow me to serve the new master I have found in peace!</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> After all this time...!</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> I have finally found a master that does not see shinobi as disposable pawns, but treats me with kindness and respect!</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> I can hardly fathom my fortune in meeting [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her}! I can never hope to adequately pay [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her} back!</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> That is why I at least want to be of as much use to [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her} as I possibly can, to my very last breath!</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> And yet...!</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> You CEASELESSY seek to prevent me from doing so! Why!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Chiyome...</p><hr><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> Forgive my loss of temper, Master, but I am afraid my patience has reached its absolute limit!</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong></p><p>Lady Shuten-Douji!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Yeees?</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> You are Shuten-Douji of Mt. Ooe... The oni of the Heian period...</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> No! As far as I am concerned, you are no oni of Mt. Ooe! You are nothing less than the child of the great serpent god responsible for my curse!</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> I know that the ancient serpent, or perhaps dragon, known as Yamata-no-Orochi, was once worshipped as Ibuki Daimyojin...and that he had a single child to his name!</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> You, Lady Ibuki-Douji!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> ...Well, well. You&#39;ve got guts, calling me by THAT True Name, hmm, Chiyome.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> My, my... You must reeeally hate me...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> I was hoping for something like this, but I really must admit, you&#39;ve surpassed all my expectations.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> What is it they say these days about courage? Ah yes. You&#39;ve got balls of steel...figuratively speaking.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> I do love a good display of courage.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Just look at you shaking in your boots, digging your heels in like a child trying to look taller than she really is.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> You really care for Master that much? You wanna serve [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her} so badly it hurts?</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> ...I do.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Then...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> ...are you having a steamy romance with [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her}? You ARE a widow, as I recall.</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> L-l-loyalty and longing have nothing to do with one another!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Mm... Is that so? Then what would you do if [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she} asked you to share [\u2642 his /\u2640\uFE0F her} bed?</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> If that is what my Master requires, I would not hesitate!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Then you ARE having a little romance with [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her}.</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> I-I told you that loyalty and longing have nothing to do with one another! Now, cease this at once! I will not have you slander Master&#39;s good name any further!</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> Even if you are the daughter of Ibuki... I will not let you insult [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her} again...</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> ...no matter how much the cursed blood of my ancestor, Kouga Saburou, may torment me!</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> Be warned, Lady Ibuki! Your next word will be your last!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Come get me.</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> ...Very well then! Have at you!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> (Huff, huff...huff...!) Her magical energy seems...inexhaustible!</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> (Huff, huff...) (Gasp...) We shinobi...do not usually find ourselves out of breath...</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> So this is the power of an oni... Nay, the true power of Shuten-Douji, daughter of Orochi!!!</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> ...And apparently, she is still only using a fraction of it.</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> Yet here I am, employing my full strength, to no avail. Is this is her oni power at work, or her serpent power?</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> Nonetheless... I will not admit defeat yet...</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> ...I refuse to lay down my blade until the very end!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s enough, Chiyome!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Stop this! Both of you!</p><hr><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> That&#39;s some fighting spirit you&#39;ve got. Still not enough to take down an oni, though.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> But hey, you tried.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Well, I&#39;m satisfied. I give up. You win, I lose. See you around.</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> ...I was watching the whole time, Shuten.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Hey now, what&#39;s with the pouty face? I was just about to take a hot bath. Step aside, will you?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> Do you have a thing for getting mixed up in other people&#39;s business or something?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> Why else would you go around teasing that half-assed snake demon who clings desperately to her humanity?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> Come to think of it, you did the same thing with that whole pagoda thing a while back. It&#39;s almost as if...</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Yes?</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> Have you...</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> ...Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;ve started feeling sorry for humans?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Fu... Hehe, fufufu.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Fufufufufufufufufu!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!Hehe, hehehe! That&#39;s the funniest thing you&#39;ve ever said, Ibaraki!</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> You&#39;ve got it completely backwards!</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> Backwards...?</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Fufu. It doesn&#39;t matter how many oni descendants or cursed bloodlines we get here. Those cowards could never be up to the task, since they wouldn&#39;t last a single breath against either you or I.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Humans, Heroic Spirits...they&#39;re all the same.</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Just one little puff, and poof...they&#39;re gone.</p><p><strong>Ibaraki-Douji:</strong> ???</p><p><strong>Shuten-Douji:</strong> Oh, I&#39;m just thinking out loud. Don&#39;t mind me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You did great, Chiyome.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Way to go!</p><hr><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> Thank you!</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> Although, I am still not sure if she was taking that fight seriously... I feel as though she was merely testing me.</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> But regardless, my resolve will waver no longer. Orochi&#39;s curse may never leave me...</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> ...and I may never entirely overcome my fear of it...but now I won&#39;t ever lose sight of where my loyalties lie.</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> So please, worry not, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Not a problem.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Glad to have you with us, Chiyome.</p><hr><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> Thank you!</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> ...I suppose I never did tell you about my ancestor, Saburou, and his curse.</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> I am truly sorry for that, Master! Truly!</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> I trust it hardly need be said at this point, but, yes, I am cursed, and there is nothing that can be done about it.</p><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> So, if you wish to end our contract, and be rid of me and all the trouble I bring, I will understand...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m not ending anything.</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;ll always be welcome here, Chiyome!</p><hr><p><strong>Chiyome:</strong> Thank you, Master!!!
