What&#39;s the difference between a lizard and a dragon?</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Good question. To answer, first we&#39;ll have to talk about the phantasmal species\u2013</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> So, um, what&#39;s going on here?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Teacher?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;m not sure...</p><hr><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> You there! No whispering in class! This is important.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Oh, right... But we need to get going... to the next dimensional distortion.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> True. That&#39;s enough prepping, we will continue the lecture as in-field studies.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Our goal this time is to repair a space that became unstable due to the last Rayshift.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The problem should have fixed itself when we restored the timeline, but a little remained.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> My analysis shows that a number of phantasmal species, AKA dragons, have fled there.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> If we don&#39;t fix it, the distortion may cause a wide-scale dimensional collapse.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So the distortion isn&#39;t disappearing because of the dragon&#39;s magical energy, right?</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Phantasmal species...dragons in particular generate magical energy just by breathing.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> The output of such energy is capable of maintaining the distortion.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Let&#39;s go then, Senpai. Doctor, send us there.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Okay, this is an irregular Rayshift, but it&#39;s all set. Fujimaru, go slay us some dragons.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So this is the dimensional distortion...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fooou.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Looks like you made it. But this...It&#39;s like another world.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> It&#39;s a rare phenomenon, but I&#39;m detecting draconic essence from our surroundings.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Let&#39;s take a photo to record this.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Is that...a camera?</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Yes, Master let me borrow it. There were none in my time.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> It is a truly powerful relic that instantly paints what you see.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> At first, I just collected the paintings, but lately I&#39;ve gotten into it.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Look at this new lens for instance! Photography is a fascinating and endless abyss.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Glad you like it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Relic...</p><hr><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Thank you for this wonderful present. I shall repay you with my blade.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Hey, no time for talking! They&#39;re here! Three of them!</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Master, be careful. Let&#39;s be on our way, then!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We did it, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> We killed the dragons!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Is this all?</p><hr><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> No, these were a lower subspecies of dragon called wyverns.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> These wyverns lack the magical energy to maintain such a space as this.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Yeah, defeating them didn&#39;t change anything. Hmm, I&#39;ll trace the reaction...W-What the heck?</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> ...There it is. Prepare the cam... I mean, prepare for combat.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> This reaction&#39;s incredible... It&#39;s three times bigger than a normal dragon!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I mean, there aren&#39;t really normal dragons, but... What&#39;s going on here?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A mutation...or something like it?</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> No, nothing so simple. It feels as if it&#39;s absorbed the others.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Absorbed them?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You mean it ate them?</p><hr><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Yes, I&#39;ve never seen a cannibalistic dragon before. \u2014It has power, but little intelligence.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Either way, it&#39;s still a rare species. Let me take a photograph.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> You can do that later! But if it ate the other dragons...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> A dragon&#39;s just a giant lump of magical energy... If it ate them all...this thing is crazy!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Mr. Geo, how do we deal with this?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Mr. Geo...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What do we do?</p><hr><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Calm down, Mash. Your teacher&#39;s name is Mr. Georgios, not Mr. Geo.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> And it doesn&#39;t matter what kind of dragon it is, none shall survive our attack.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Dragons were born to be eradicated. Be punished for your sins, dragon!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Let&#39;s go, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> This is the end, take this! Ascalon!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> D-Did we get it...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Man, that was one tough enemy, huh?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Oh, now that the dragon&#39;s gone, the distortion is starting to close.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;ll bring you guys back, get ready. Setting coordinates now...</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> \u2013Nameless dragon of another world, rest in peace.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Teacher...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Aren&#39;t dragons sinners?</p><hr><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Even if dragons are sinners born to be destroyed, that doesn&#39;t mean they deserve to be destroyed.</p><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> \u2013Sin and punishment should be separate things.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai, we need to go or the distortion will close...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Let&#39;s go!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Let&#39;s go, Teacher.</p><hr><p><strong>Georgios:</strong> Yes... Oh, let me get one last photo...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Forget about that!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fooou.</p>',100),a=[n];function g(i,p){return t(),r("div",null,a)}var l=o(s,[["render",g],["__file","Georgios.html.vue"]]);export{l as default};
