Even if it is insignificant in all that has happened...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Even if it was just me slaying my enemy.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> The indescribable sadness, anger, happiness, and more than anything\u2014relief, I can still remember it.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...Relief. Yes, that can only be called &quot;relief.&quot;</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Like when a scab is torn off, it&#39;s an odd pleasure. The fear that sent a shiver up my spine, it too has vanished into thin air.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> But I was unable to touch the arrow that I myself had shot. Nor was I able to claim his head.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I could only stand there, dazed\u2014and accept the glorious victory.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...up.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Wake up, good fellow.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ???---</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Are you all right?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Napping during a storm such as this, you must have some nerves of steel.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Where in the world am I?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Good question. ...To be perfectly honest, I do not know myself.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> When I awoke, I was on this ship, being tossed about in this storm.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I have knowledge of how to steer a ship, but I&#39;m afraid all we can do is ride this out.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> As that is the case, I decided that I should speak with you, since you were leisurely napping here. Also, I had nothing better to do, either.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Who are you?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...I&#39;m not sure how to answer that. You see, I am not entirely sure myself.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I am a nameless man. The only thing that I remember is that I am an Archer Servant.</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong> ...I also have no idea where this ship will take us. Though I am a Servant, I don&#39;t even know who I am.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> It does seem that you are my Master. If possible, may I accompany you for a while?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That is fine.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Thank you. My name... Though I do not know it, I am sure I am an Archer Servant.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> It is nice to meet you, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Where is Mash?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Mash? I am not sure... There may be someone else inside this ship.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master!? Are you here, Master!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai\u2014!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Who is that?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> A dependable Servant.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Thank goodness, Master. I&#39;m so glad you&#39;re all right.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, I am (Your Name) Senpai&#39;s Servant. My name is Mash Kyrielight!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> My charming Kohai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What? Charming Kohai... Oh, I am hardly that...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No, I am still very much your Servant! You must call me dependable!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But...at any rate... Thank you...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Here is our situation, Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Apparently, during the Rayshift, we were blown off course by a strange Singularity.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Unfortunately, we&#39;re unable to contact the Doctor.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> By the way, who is that person? He looks like a well-known Servant somehow.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Unfortunately, I seem to have left my identity behind.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> However, I do know that I am an Archer. As you can see, I carry a bow for a weapon. So quite obviously I am.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Well, uhm...Excuse me. I don&#39;t mean to seem rude, but that&#39;s not a Class that can be determined by one&#39;s weapon.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> In this world where an Archer can wield two swords ([[Emiya]]), or strike with a club ([[Orion]])...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...and even hurl valuable treasures at random ([[Gilgamesh]])...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s a bit premature to assume you&#39;re an Archer just because you carry a bow.</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> There is quite a variety of heroes in the world, it seems...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> By the way, Senpai, what were you doing... Were you napping?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That is so like you, Senpai. You&#39;ve been like that since I found you sound asleep in the corridor at Chaldea!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> There&#39;s no way I can even relax. In fact, I feel a little sick...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No matter how many times I&#39;ve been through this, I still can&#39;t get used to a ship deck during a storm...</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> Though this ship is quite sturdy, there could still be trouble if the storm continues...</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> What was that?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A Ghost-type enemy. Excuse me, but we could use your help!</p><h2 id="part-2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#part-2" aria-hidden="true">#</a> (Part 2)</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We have annihilated them. Well done, Master.</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> ...How humiliating. I was hardly any help at all. I&#39;m so ashamed.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> N-No, not at all. I&#39;m just glad we&#39;re all right.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You seemed like you had doubts.</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> ...You have a keen eye. That&#39;s exactly right. I...have doubts about fighting.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Don&#39;t you want to fight?</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> A skilled Master must be able to understand a Servant, even if the Servant is not their own.</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> That&#39;s right. For me -- battle carries only melancholy with it.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Why is that?</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> I know not my True Name, nor how many Holy Grail Wars I fought, nor how many I emerged from victorious.</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> ...But I don&#39;t think I have been defeated. I have the utmost confidence in my abilities.</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> If I suffered a terrible defeat, Master certainly would have ordered me to commit suicide.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> T-Talk about confidence! But what he says is not a lie, Senpai!</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> Perhaps I remained undefeated when I was alive as well That is precisely why it is all feels so empty.</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> Whether I am victorious or defeated...</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> It is all just an infinitesimal ship washed away by the enormous waves of time.</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> The joy of victory has no meaning. The humiliation of defeat has no meaning.</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> Therefore, nothing has any meaning.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Even your life now?</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> ...That&#39;s right. It is not easy for me to say, but that is the present condition I am in.</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> If it were not for your presence, Master, I most likely would have abandoned the battle.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Even death?</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> I am a Servant to begin with... I am sure I belonged to the warrior class long before as well.</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> Therefore, I have no fear of death.</p><hr><p><strong>Lancer:</strong> That&#39;s not true, Archer. You are not a warrior unafraid of death.</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> ...!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh? Who was that!?</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong> The man you are now is not someone unafraid of death. You merely have not seen death.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong> You achieved so much glory so easily and with so little challenge that you ended up tired of life.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong> Your philosophy has led you to nothing more than desperation. You merely have a low opinion of your own existence.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong> That&#39;s not even martyrdom. I won&#39;t allow you to take that path!</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> ...Who...are you? No, wait... Who am I?</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong> ...How infuriating! Even though I proclaim the truth, you still do not understand.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong> The one and only person in this world that I cannot accept. That one person is you, bowman!</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> ...ugh!</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong> A wild and crude shot. Is that the best you can do? Then you had better restring your bow.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Archer!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Calm down, please! He&#39;s not an ally, but that doesn&#39;t make him an enemy!</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> ...I know. I know that, but... That man\u2014I won&#39;t stand for him!</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> I cannot stand your presence. For whatever reason, I cannot stand your presence!</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong> \u2014Now that&#39;s a little more like it. That fury. That unreasonable malevolence.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong> That arrogance is what makes you who you are. That aura of righteous anger is most fitting for the man who carries that bow.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong> Fire away without reservation. Come on, don&#39;t hold back.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong> I won&#39;t pull any punches either. I will run my shadow lance through your throat!</p><h3>(After Battle)</h3><p><strong>Archer:</strong> Haa, haa, haa...</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong> A tenacity that ignores the Class affinity... Our fates are truly intertwined.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong> ...But that is all for now. We must each again inquire of the Bhagavad-Gita.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong> We can continue this after that is finished. ...the Master over there, and the one who watched over that Master.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong> ...I know it may be a burden to you, but I want you to guide him. You&#39;re the only ones who can do it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Do you need guidance as well?</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong> ...It\u2018s unnecessary. But I do appreciate the offer.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong> As long as that man is present, I will be your enemy.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong> The same is true if reversed as well.</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong> A hated enemy is a necessary ingredient of myth. I am truly used to playing that part.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> But for what purpose?</p><p><strong>Lancer:</strong> I have no obligation to answer my enemies. What I am after is insignificant.</p><hr><p><strong>Archer:</strong> Master, a while ago I said that I had tired of living.</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> That is the sincere truth. My thirst for battle has also faded.</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> However... even so...</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> I cannot abide that Lancer. I know this feeling I have is unreasonable...</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> That man is most certainly a righteous person.</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> He is recognized by the people and is a hero who devotes himself to doing virtuous deeds.</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> But still, I truly, for some reason, want to battle him.</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> No, it&#39;s not a desire to battle. I want to deny him. Deny all of him. Everything.</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> ...I am certain this is an unforgivable request. This is an improper desire.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It is not improper.---</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> Not improper? What do you mean?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Most certainly he is your mortal enemy.</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> My mortal...enemy.</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> I see. Those words have hit home.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Then you should go on a quest for that answer.</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> Go on a...quest?</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> You may be right. To find out who the man is that boils my blood...</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> ...and to find out who I am. I should search for those answers.</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Archer:</strong> ...It seems the storm has passed as well, as if waking from a dream.</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> I am ever a wanderer.</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> If we meet again in reality, I would be glad if we could find those answers together.</p><p><strong>Archer:</strong> \u2014Farewell, my Master. I look forward to the day that we may meet again.</p>',166),a=[s];function h(i,g){return e(),r("div",null,a)}var u=t(n,[["render",h],["__file","Arjuna.html.vue"]]);export{u as default};
