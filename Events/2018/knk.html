Mash.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...It&#39;s a really warm dream, Fou.</p><hr><p><strong>F：???:</strong> Oh my. For a guest to arrive here... Is this some kind of mistake?</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong> If you&#39;re dreaming, go back to where you came from.</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong> This is a place without boundaries. You have a name, so you shouldn&#39;t be here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Well, I woke up here...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I didn&#39;t come here because I wanted to...</p><hr><p><strong>F：???:</strong> You didn&#39;t want to be here? In that case... Hehe, sorry.</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong> Looks like our connection was made from this side. Let me apologize while I can, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong> I&#39;m asleep and thus unaware of what&#39;s going on outside. But I can take a guess.</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong> I&#39;m sure it&#39;s just another hack-and-slash type of case without a hint of romance.</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong> What a disaster, busy Master. But it&#39;s a good thing to have things you can do, things you must do.</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong> ...Yes, rather than talk about myself, I would love to talk more about your future, but...</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong> Too bad, the night is almost over. Seems like this dream is about to end.</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong> If we meet again, could you please call me by my name?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Hi, I know it&#39;s only midnight, but good morning, Fujimaru. Sorry to wake you up.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> However, it&#39;s an emergency, so I contacted you anyway. I&#39;m sorry, but please come to the Command Room immediately.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, Foou!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Good evening, Mash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, good evening, Senpai. This will be a night shift, so thank you for all your hard work.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Good morning, Mash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Good morning... Meaning, you were already sleeping, Senpai?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I think it&#39;s good to sleep early. It means you&#39;re someone with dreams and hopes.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> —Oops, now is not the time for greetings.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Doctor Roman requested an urgent dispatch. Hurry to the Command Room, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Right, let&#39;s get going!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...Hey, isn&#39;t it kind of quiet?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Now that you mention it... Chaldea does feel kind of empty...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Usually, you&#39;ll see a lot of non-assigned Servants strolling through these hallways...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But tonight of all nights, we didn&#39;t run into anyone...</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Ah, both of you are here. That saves me time in explaining.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Now, then, please look at the monitor. Around Japan on the world map.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Is it Singularity F? I thought we already recovered the Holy Grail at those coordinates.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Not Fuyuki, but next to it. You can see a strange distortion, right?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It&#39;s been under observation for several days.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> At first, I thought it was a small error caused by the fluctuation of Singularity F&#39;s repair.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> But it wouldn&#39;t disappear even after a considerate amount of time. Then I tried changing Sheba&#39;s observation angle...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> There are signs of life! But these coordinates should have been incinerated!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Oh, and that&#39;s not all.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I only detected a few life forms, but I picked up countless moving objects.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> On top of that, no matter how much I adjust Sheba, I can&#39;t get a read on the scale and era of these coordinates.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It&#39;s a complete black box. We won&#39;t know what&#39;s going on unless we Rayshift there.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So, is it a new Singularity?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;m sorry, but I can&#39;t even be sure about that. Humanity has been destroyed, and the outside world incinerated.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> At least before 2018, when humans were still alive.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The cause of such atrocities, what made them possible, was our loss of coordinates called the Foundations of Humanity—</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Historical events that became the essential support pillars of our human history...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...such as those that occurred in France and Rome.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> In response, Chaldea prevented the collapse of these foundations by Rayshifting into them from outside the time flow.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Even if it&#39;s already incinerated in the proper timeline, Chaldea can Rayshift to a time before the destruction, and prevent its collapse.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Fujimaru, just think of what you&#39;ve been doing as repairing a completely incinerated scroll.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> However, these coordinates are different. They don&#39;t exist in any history.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Think of it as something that&#39;s lost. A hole eaten away by bugs.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> As usual, right?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Yes, simply put, that&#39;s exactly it! You&#39;re really reliable, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I was ready to explain a lot of things, but in short, you should take a chance on everything!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Hmm, Doctor. I request further explanation on what you just said.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> There are few signs of life, but multiple moving objects. What does that mean?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Let me explain it! Even if it&#39;s the night shift, I can still give you a lecture with my glamorous beauty!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Who am I? I am the lady who loves those green cubes, everybody&#39;s favorite shop owner, Da Vinci!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Good evening. It&#39;s a nice night out.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It&#39;s the perfect night for a ghost story. Not that any of them happened at Chaldea.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Are you kidding me with Mona Lisa?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Oh, stop throwing silver embers at me! It&#39;s my bad! I was just having a little bit of fun!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...But that Craft Essence was pretty well made, right? My only regret is that I couldn&#39;t write the explanation in mirrored letters.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Good evening, Da Vinci. Please give us your explanation.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> They are not alive, yet they are moving around... In other words, that place is full of zombies.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Well, it&#39;s not like you will be surprised by them. Zombies were in France, too.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But there&#39;s another problem, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> If the seven Singularities are like stains on the scroll we call human history, that fake Singularity is like a hole in that scroll.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I don&#39;t understand how it happened, but it&#39;s luring the Servants and trapping them in there.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Trapping the Servants?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Speaking of which, did you notice that Chaldea is a lot more quiet than usual?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The Servants that Fujimaru successfully summoned and formed a contract with...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> They&#39;re receiving magical energy from Chaldea and setting up anchors for their existence all around this base.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> You can call it a temporary incarnation.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> If they keep using magical energy from their Master each time they&#39;re summoned into battle, Fujimaru would be all dried up already.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> So, in order to lessen the burden cast on Fujimaru,</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Chaldea is using 40% of its power to sustain the contract with each Servant.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> As long as Grand Order is still in effect, these Servants have made Chaldea their home.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I didn&#39;t know...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I had a vague idea...</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yes, yes. Oh, just so you know, I&#39;m different. Even if Chaldea&#39;s light has gone out, I can still sustain my body.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Ahem!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> About those Servants. A few of them disappeared when this distortion was observed.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> They all headed to this distortion of their own free will... And then they never came back.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Never came back... So they weren&#39;t eliminated? That means...they stayed there?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Exactly. Their contracts with Fujimaru are still intact.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The Heroic Spirits who Rayshifted to that strange hole are either staying there of their own free will, or—</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s possible that they&#39;re trapped and can&#39;t come back.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> That&#39;s everything. This distortion has nothing to do with the Foundation of Humanity.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It wouldn&#39;t cause any harm even if left as it is... However, it&#39;s also true the Servants are not coming back.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Fujimaru. Mash. I want you to investigate these coordinates.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Rayshifting anywhere other than a Singularity is an exception, and requires the authorization of the former Director, but...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Will you do it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Of course, Doctor.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> If they are taken, we&#39;ll get them back!</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Thank you. You&#39;re so reliable!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Then we will commence Rayshifting now. You two, start your preparations.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> We don&#39;t know what might happen there. And we won&#39;t be able to send backup.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Please, be careful over there. Oh, and one more thing... This is just a hunch, but...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Perhaps Fujimaru will find the scenery over there very familiar.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> If that&#39;s the case, please show Mash around. She&#39;s never seen anything like that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I don&#39;t really get it, but roger!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Familiar scenery?</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> You&#39;ll understand when you get there. Well then, commencing Rayshift!</p><h2 id="encounter" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#encounter" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Encounter</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A road made of asphalt... High-rises like big walls...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This is...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m sure of it! This is the 21st-century Japan, Senpai!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Look! See? A vending machine that isn&#39;t destroyed!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Even a public phone, and a bus stop, too! Ah, and that thing like a house is a toilet!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The city seems so quiet and the streets are so clean! The example of a perfectly safe city!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Unfortunately, I don&#39;t see any of those so-called convenience stores– The places that never sleep!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It really is just like what I&#39;ve read... One of my dreams has come true!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It was your dream?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ah... Yes. I&#39;m sorry, I got carried away. It&#39;s not that I dreamed of visiting a city in Japan.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Not only Tokyo, but Washington, Moscow, Beijing, Rome, Madrid...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Any one of them would have been fine. I just wanted to visit a major city from the era I live in.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It seems pretty normal...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ugh. It&#39;s almost like you&#39;re saying, “What&#39;s so special about a city like this?”</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai, did you live in a city like this one? No, I am sure you did.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Please tell me more about it, in detail! Everything from your life in elementary school to high school! Please!</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Hello, test, test. Communication, video feed, both working fine.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Ah, as I thought... Judging from these coordinates and time, I predicted your destination to be a city in Japan.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> But... I didn&#39;t expect it to be such an urban area. This seems pretty fishy to me...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...You&#39;re right. A normal city in a time like this is the most abnormal thing.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The only two normal life-form responses are from Senpai and myself... But I&#39;m also getting some higher-class life-form responses from that building.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> —A big city like this, with this many houses, and still no one in sight.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Building? Oh, that cylindrical one? It sure looks weird... Fujimaru, can you tell us anything about it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s like a spooky tower.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I agree. I&#39;m getting chills just looking at it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It&#39;s just an apartment.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Just an apartment? But its design is so different than the other buildings surrounding it...</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Anyway, that building is undeniably suspicious. I&#39;m picking up readings of multiple Servants inside as well.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No obstacles detected from here to the building entrance. Let&#39;s go there and... Wait! Senpai!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> There&#39;s someone around the entrance! It&#39;s—</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;m picking up multiple strange signals! Residual wills... They&#39;re ghosts!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Looks like a Servant is fighting with them!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Hurry up, Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, Master!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Wait! I&#39;m not picking up any more ghost readings! They didn&#39;t disperse, they disappeared—</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> As if they were erased with an eraser! That&#39;s a little scary, isn&#39;t it!? What is it!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Servant response, entering our line of sight! Is that—a woman?</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong> ...Phew, cheap dream. Its quality is too low to be a nightmare.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong> Ghosts with skulls as faces? Man, they gotta get with the times.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s a girl...in a kimono...holding a knife! Senpai, who is she?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I don&#39;t know her.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve ever seen her face.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Just as I thought Let&#39;s try to talk to her first...</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong> No need. I don&#39;t want to talk to you. It&#39;ll take too long.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong> Doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re good or bad. With this knife in your head, you can say goodbye to this reality.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong> You&#39;re the one who stuck your nose in other people&#39;s business, yeah? I am gonna send that nose, along with your head, to where they belong!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Here she comes! I don&#39;t get it, but it&#39;s a battle, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE-</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Battle was interrupted, but...we still don&#39;t know that Servant&#39;s real name, nor its attack pattern!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Doctor, please give us your analysis!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> How can a simple knife cut not only a Servant&#39;s body, but easily cut its armor too?!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...It&#39;s Mystic Eyes. I can&#39;t believe Mystic Eyes of this level still exist in the modern era.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Doctor?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> In the world of Magecraft, magical eyes that can perceive all things mystical are called Mystic Eyes.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> These eyes can project phenomena without casting any sorts of chants or rituals. They just need to look.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The most popular types are “Binding,” “Compulsion,” “Contract,” “Flame,” “Illusion,” and “Jinx.”</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Even among them, her eyes are special. The type that can “Stop” everything, it&#39;s even more powerful than “Petrification.”</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Her rainbow eyes materialize the concept of death and capture it. If I had to give them a name, I&#39;d call them the Mystic Eyes of Death Perception.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> How incredible! That&#39;s an ability fit for a Divine Spirit! To kill an enemy just by looking at them... Talk about overpowered!</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong> ...What&#39;s up with him? He sounded so fake and unimportant...</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong> I&#39;m not a Heroic Spirit. I can&#39;t kill anyone just by looking at them.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong> All I can do is see death... Lines that trace death. Ummm, like the eventual end of all things.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong> Would you understand if I say I simply trace the cause, the result of eventual death?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, um, I see... The, uh, lines that trace death... The, the eventual end of all things... Y-Yes...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t get it at all.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Me neither. It seems to be a highly advanced magical theory, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> So you slash a person&#39;s life span?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai, you understand?!</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong> Huh, that was easy. Hey, you must be a big otaku, right? Disgusting. Absolutely disgusting.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> (Nice, Fujimaru! She looks happy! Really happy!)</p><hr><p><strong>D：???:</strong> Whatever. Hey, you there! The slippery-looking one!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> M-Me?!</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong> Of course! Who else could it be? Physically, you&#39;re not a complete Servant, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> R-Right. I&#39;m a Demi-Servant, so you could say that my base body is human...</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong> I see. I thought you were that shadowy bastard&#39;s friend.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong> That [♂ man /♀️ woman]&#39;s eyes are glittering. I guess that rules out the possibility of being possessed by some weird illusions.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong> My bad for attacking you. All right, see ya.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What? Hold on!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Where do you think you&#39;re going?!</p><hr><p><strong>D：???:</strong> I am going to tear down this apartment. I can&#39;t just leave it like that.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong> It&#39;s crawling with disgusting things inside. If I let it be, it&#39;s gonna cause trouble for the neighbors.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong> Say, do you guys watch horror movies? You do? Good.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong> You know the deal... Things like walking corpses, ghosts you aren&#39;t supposed to see...</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong> Things like that are running rampant in there... All because of Servants.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> All because of...Servants?</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong> Yeah. Servants live in that apartment like it&#39;s their own. Thanks to them, it&#39;s all becoming one big block party.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong> I mean, Servants are kinda like ghosts, right? If they gain physical bodies, others will get carried away too.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong> ...Well, as for myself, I am also showing up as a Servant.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong> If you&#39;re a Demi-Servant, I guess that makes me a Pseudo-Servant.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong> Most likely I had a connection with this building, so I ended up being summoned. It&#39;s really annoying.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> If you&#39;re a Servant, you need a Master...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Will you be okay by yourself?</p><hr><p><strong>D：???:</strong> Who cares? If I vanish, it actually saves me some trouble. At least I don&#39;t have to go through this ordeal.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re being frank, or you just don&#39;t care about yourself...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Still, though... There must be a reason why we met here!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> If you don&#39;t have a Master, could you work with Chaldea?</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong> ...A reason, you say. This, too, must be my fate... I don&#39;t hate it.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong> That one over there is a Master, right? If I help you, that would really make me look like a Servant.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong> I&#39;m merely an outsider who was summoned here. I don&#39;t intend on concerning myself with others.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong> However, I want to pay back that despicable shadowy bastard...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, foou!</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong> !</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Fou!? Were you hiding in my shield again?</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong> ...Are you kidding me? What is this furball?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You never know when Fou will show up...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Fou is everyone&#39;s favorite Runner!</p><hr><p><strong>D：???:</strong> ...Ryougi Shiki.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What?</p><hr><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> That is my name. What&#39;s your name?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Right, this is Master Fujimaru. My name is Mash Kyrielight.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> If we&#39;re exchanging our names like this... Does that mean you&#39;ll help us, Shiki?</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> ...Well, if you think about it, the fact that you&#39;re a Master probably means you&#39;re related to the Servants living here somehow, right?</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> In that case, you&#39;re supposed to be the ones to get rid of them. Good luck. I&#39;ll be giving you a hand too, so don&#39;t worry.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Thank you, Ryougi-chan!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> You can just call me Ryougi. Aren&#39;t you embarrassed, using “chan?”</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...Do you like cats?</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> No, I don&#39;t. Also, I wouldn&#39;t call that thing a cat.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> It has good fur and feels really nice, that&#39;s all. It doesn&#39;t even look like one. That&#39;s insulting to cats.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Oh... I was keeping my mouth shut because she didn&#39;t look like she could take a joke... But I&#39;m glad it all worked out!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Erm... Should I call you Miss Ryougi? You seem to know all about that apartment?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> What was it like inside? Did it turn into a different dimension? It won&#39;t kill them upon entering, right?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> As you can see, Fujimaru is just a human. If the air composition is abnormal then...</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> Ah, you don&#39;t have to worry. Rest assured, it&#39;s the same Ogawa as ever.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> But there are lots of enemies, and there are some funny traps.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Funny traps? What kind of traps?</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> That will be a surprise. It was a questionable property from the start anyway.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> Here used to be the grave marker of an old mage who attempted to collect death. A hollow shrine that fused the yin-yang and hell together.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> People say “investigations start from the bottom,” right? Enjoy the case, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> So once again, rookie Master...

Something&#39;s not right, Senpai. The thermometer shows normal values, but I feel like we&#39;re inside a freezer...</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. Since there&#39;s an air conditioner, why don&#39;t you try turning on the heater?</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> Isn&#39;t that right, big guy?

When a contract is bound to Chaldea...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The defeated Spirit Origin doesn&#39;t return to the Throne of Heroes, but to Chaldea instead.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Given some time, he&#39;ll probably return to Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> We still don&#39;t know why he was in that room, but it seems like you just “freed” a Servant.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Is that so? He was rather aggressive, but at least we&#39;ve reached a solution.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> As I thought, there&#39;s nothing here. This is the wrong room. Let&#39;s check the others, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> What? You look sad...

Police officers and residents still walk around despite being dead.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s obviously unconventional in modern Japan. In that case, this place must be a magecraft workshop built in secrecy, right?</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> If it were, it wouldn&#39;t be quite so bad... Unfortunately, this apartment was built in public with no secrets.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> A permit was submitted to the local office, and a normal construction company worked on it.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> It even asked regular folks to move in. However, now it&#39;s becoming a place no one wants to go near.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...It&#39;s a barrier created using man&#39;s natural instinct to avoid taboos...without a single trace of Magecraft.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It&#39;s common sense for mages after the 20th century to conceal their workshops in order to avoid detection from the public.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> However, we can&#39;t detect any traces of magical energy from this place.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> If it&#39;s a magecraft workshop, then whoever created it must be really cautious and patient.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> That mage built a building this size to perform a ritual, yet didn&#39;t rely on Magecraft.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> They simply built this place from the ground up, brick by brick, all by themselves. Kind of like building a tower.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Which reminds me of buddhist folklore that talks about children stacking rocks in hell, with all effort and no gain.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Just simply continuing a mundane task without complaint, and without companionship.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> ...The Children&#39;s Limbo, huh? Indeed, it fits him.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> But you&#39;re wrong, it&#39;s not a nice place like that. This is simply a building that collects death.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> Death by natural causes, illness, accidents, and violence.

When morning comes, they are reborn. No matter what happens, they always die the same way.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> It&#39;s a loop, no, a retry.

That kind of thing still troubles you?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Fujimaru is not a mage, so [♂ he /♀️ she] tends to think differently than those elites at the Mage&#39;s Association.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> But... I don&#39;t understand this building at all. What can they achieve with this kind of experiment?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> There are no results. There is no gain. Even if they&#39;re creating a model case, there&#39;s no goal...</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> You&#39;ll have to ask the creator himself. Although he&#39;s no longer in this world.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> Anyway, this is now a haunted apartment with zombies walking around.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> On top of that, ghosts and Servants are starting to show up. The effects are showing up in the outside world.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> ...Seriously. It&#39;s creepy, but this one-life-one-death world wasn&#39;t supposed to cause trouble for anybody.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> I mean, what the hell are those Servants?! All of them are in some weird get-ups...</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> Mash, you were lucky that this was a haunted apartment. You would&#39;ve been reported if we were in front of the station.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Reported? Is that because I am not from around here?</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> ...Say, do you know why I only carry a knife around with me?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Ah, so that&#39;s what you mean... You&#39;re right!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Fujimaru, we&#39;re lucky that this Singularity isn&#39;t a perfect recreation of the downtown area.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> If we were in front of a station, just Mash changing into her Servant form would get us in trouble with the police.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I didn&#39;t talk about this a lot, but Chaldea is what you would call “a secret organization.”</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> You can&#39;t recklessly summon your Servants nor arm Mash in front of people.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It depends on the city, but Mash&#39;s Servant form could be considered indecent in some places.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> NO WAY!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You just realized?</p><hr><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> ...I wasn&#39;t talking about her appearance, but her weapon... Anyway...</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> We&#39;re here. There&#39;s no nameplate either, right? I&#39;m sure a Servant is living in this room.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Yes. I can detect a Servant&#39;s Spirit Origin in there.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What will we do, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Let&#39;s ring the doorbell.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Let&#39;s go inside.</p><hr><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> Right, that&#39;s the spirit. Here is the key. I will give it to you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...(Gulp) Master, I&#39;ll open the door.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Who on earth is inside this room?</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Yes, yes, certainly!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Welcome, unknown Master! You too, Miss Demi-Servant!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> The one who moved into this grudge-soaked apartment, of course it is I, Demon Mephistopheles!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> ...What&#39;s the deal with his scissors? Oh, he knows Mash?</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> This funny guy here is Mash&#39;s big brother or what?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I couldn&#39;t take having a brother like Mephisto! The breakfast table would be a catastrophe!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> The breakfast table? That&#39;s all you&#39;re worried about? Yes, you&#39;re right, breakfast should be enjoyed quietly.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> I may look like this, but I&#39;ve cared for stubborn and stinky old guys, too.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> I&#39;m able to make good and tasty breakfasts, unfortunately, I&#39;m incapable of closing this mouth!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Even if you sew it, or zip it, it&#39;s useless! Even without a mouth, I can give you bad news using ventriloquism</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> For example, my neighbor in Room 3. Watanabe, was it? Tormented by his lover, whom he strangled.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> He&#39;s like a skull, a nervous wreck, malnourished! At 2 o&#39;clock, the time of his crime, the madness begins!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Drugs, hanging, wrist-slashing, gas poisoning. Every night he has to escape from his nightmare.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> His excuses for his own actions are quite unsightly, and yet pleasurable.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> There is no better spice to make a meal delicious than other people&#39;s misfortune!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This manner of speaking...this is the real Mephisto! But why are you here?!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Oh? Oh, oh, oh! Hmm? Hum, hum, hum...</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> This is the first time I&#39;m meeting you, but how many times have you met me?</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> I knew it! I&#39;ve already caused trouble for you!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> This is destiny! Conviction, betrayal and satisfaction! Now I understand why I was summoned to Chaldea!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Unfortunately, I am different from that thing, the “I” that was summoned in early stages!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Hahaha! Hehehehe! And! I am the criminal behind this case!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> I am the one who invited those ghosts into this apartment!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> It was also I who infiltrated Chaldea, and lured promising-looking Servants one by one!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> That was all my handiwork! Yahoo! It worked perfectly!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Hmm, but now I have to break the bad news to you. Yes, Mephy is sad!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> I&#39;ve finally met a good Master like you, and now I have to cut you into pieces.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> You see, the previous tenant of this room had a bizarre hobby... He would sever the limbs of his loved one every night.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> He did it to hide the dead body? But get this! He tripped and accidentally killed himself while cutting up the body in the bathroom!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> It was so hilarious so I took over his job for him.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Where is this tenant now you ask?</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Well, you see, now he&#39;s just in the way, right? I mean, he must be bored to death now that he can&#39;t accidentally kill himself anymore?</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> That&#39;s why I intervened to make it funny. By now, he must have escaped the system, and joined his ghost buddies outside!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Now, let&#39;s start! Let&#39;s just start! It&#39;s annoying to explain so let&#39;s just start!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> I am the demon, the bomber, Mephisto Pheles! The demon who blows up boring daydreams!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Wow, I repeated the word demon so many times! But it doesn&#39;t matter!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Master and Lady, please be sure to remember this, now!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Mephisto Pheles is in combat mode! Master, what should we do?!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> What should we do? There&#39;s only one thing to do! Our opponent is ready!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m used to handling bombers. I&#39;ll wipe that smirk off his face before the bomb blows up!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE-</strong></p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Oh... How can this be... To ignore what you&#39;re told is a bad move, a lost cause, extreme uselessness!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> You killed me, the only one who knows the truth! Now the case is cold, dead people tell no tales. It&#39;s too late!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> But how should I put it? There are a lot of mystery novels where the perpetrator dies in the beginning, right?</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> You guys, use your heads, and solve this abnormal situation!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Enemy Servant eliminated. Was that really the right move?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Now we have no clues...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Right... Although Mephisto&#39;s words are not really trustworthy, if he really was the cause of this abnormality...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Then we just destroyed the only lead we had... We&#39;re bad detectives.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Let&#39;s visit the next Servant.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> Oh, you recovered from that pretty fast. Right, that&#39;s not a bad thing.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> Don&#39;t feel bad, Mash. Eliminating one or two perpetrators won&#39;t be an issue.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> Didn&#39;t I say “investigations start from the bottom”? The next crime scene is waiting for us, detective.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Hum... Detective story... So this was a detective story? No, never mind that...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Even if it was self-proclaimed, killing the perpetrator is pretty damaging...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> At least if we&#39;d arrested him, we could&#39;ve interrogated him about this place, and why it attracts ghosts...</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> That&#39;s right! I&#39;m really sorry! I wanted to be useful and use my scissors as much as possible...</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> ...but this time, I had nothing to do, there was no room for me to act! I ended up moving around in vain!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, until now, I can&#39;t remember you being useful at any time... Basically, you&#39;re totally useless...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Wh-What?!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> Sc-Scissors guy!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Why did you come out of your room?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> This is Mash&#39;s big brother?!</p><hr><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> There was another one!? Good, I&#39;ll kill you as many times as it takes!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Wait, no need for that. The one you defeated is the evil Mephisto.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> The one here is me, the good Mephisto. Ah, in other words...</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> One of me laments this situation, and the other one enjoys it. But now is not the time to question my conscience.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> So, if I split my good heart and evil heart apart like this...</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> I can basically clone myself! Oooohhh, UNBELIEVABLE!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Hmm, you did show up as support.</p><hr><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Of course. Hmm... Fujimaru, was it?</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> From now, I am a loyal Servant of Fujimaru! SO. LOYAL. (LMAO)</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> To prove it, I shall part ways with my evil self and lend a hand to everyone here!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ah... It seems too good to be true, but... What do you think, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Tell the truth in two lines or less.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Tell us what you know in two lines or less.</p><hr><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> Good decision. You really are good.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Only two lines? That&#39;s impossible! But I will try. I am an innocent clown. I merely play the pipe like Hamelin did!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s two lines!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> You can do it if you try.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Hmm. If you call yourself innocent, then you have nothing to do with this fake Singularity, right?</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Not in the least! To tell you the truth... I&#39;m truly sorry but if you could allow me to get involved, and tone down the rate of ghost-gathering,</p><p>I could make a horror show, incredibly realistic, about half dead, half living, killing and being killed...</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> In two lines!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> I was summoned by someone else, not via Chaldea&#39;s summoning system, to this tower of resentment.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> By that guy, his name is... That guy... Grand something. That guy is one class above mine.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> !!!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> He said to me, “Shouldn&#39;t you be on this side?” And he does have a point, so...</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> After that, I split dramatically.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> My evil self disguised itself as a Servant of Justice and infiltrated Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> I&#39;m sure that&#39;s possible because I&#39;m over there.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Because only Servants who were summoned by a Master can find Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> My evil self used this clever loophole, and started recruiting.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> He said: “There&#39;s a new place to live. There are rooms for Servants. You don&#39;t need a deposit. The first month is free. Move in as fast as possible!”</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Ah, I am such a good salesman! I am jealous of myself!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> But it can&#39;t be helped. Chaldea&#39;s rooms for Servants are too small!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> No posters on the wall. No pets in the rooms, except for those that came with horses.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> That&#39;s why everyone came to this side. Then, when I got the chance...</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> I escaped from the Grand-something&#39;s contract, and happily waited for all you to arrive!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Ah, I knew!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> That Fujimaru would admonish my evil self and believe in my good heart...hehe, to think that you&#39;d believe in me!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> You heard him. People really trust you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re coming with us, Mephy?</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Of course I am! Don&#39;t think about kicking me out!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Weren&#39;t you just laughing, right now?</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Of course I laughed! I laugh when good things happens, I&#39;m human after all!</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, foou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Fou...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Master. Fou is also encouraging you, let&#39;s just bring Mephisto with us.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> If we can make him tell us what he knows on the way, that would be great. Just don&#39;t expect too much.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Hehe, did you reach a conclusion?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Mephisto, don&#39;t betray us, okay?</p><hr><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll absolutely obey the winner.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> In the first place, speaking of danger, I&#39;m the same as Miss Assassin right there.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Please, could you add me to this investigation team? Be careful of your back and neck!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...You heard him. Are you the same as him, Shiki?</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> Don&#39;t compare me with him! My knife cuts way better than his scissors!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s what gets you angry?!</p><hr><h2 id="_1st-floor-room-no-4" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_1st-floor-room-no-4" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 1st Floor, Room No.4</h2><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> This sure is a strange-looking apartment... Its corridors are much longer than they appear to be.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...its elevator has a “Forever Out of Order” sign, and it&#39;s always empty.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> There&#39;s a sign that points to the stairs going up, but we&#39;ll never reach it.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Ryougi, was this building always like this? Or is it just this time?</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> Yeah. It was always a creepy apartment, but this time it&#39;s even worse.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> The width of the corridors, the number of rooms... Stuff like that doesn&#39;t really make a difference.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> But this temperature... I can&#39;t deal with this cold. Now this really feels like a haunted house.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You mentioned this as a place that collects death. It doesn&#39;t collect ghosts?</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> Indeed. It&#39;s more like it traps them here. It didn&#39;t collect them endlessly like this.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> Now this place is like a whirlpool. It pulls in unrelated stuff and turns it into evil.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Evil?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...Harmless ghosts becoming evil spirits?</p><hr><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Big swirl! Hole, gap, black hole! I got it! It&#39;s easier to understand this way!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> I thought this place was like a magnetic field that attracted grudges like a lightning rod...</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> But a big tree&#39;s hollow trunk is more suitable. Once you take a peek, if you&#39;re unlucky, you will fall into the eternal abyss.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Hehe... A trap hole that opened in reality? Make sure you don&#39;t push me!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Mephisto, you&#39;re saying it, but stop pushing Senpai, please!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> ...You guys sure get along. Was he like this back in Chaldea, too?</p><p><strong>Mash and Dr. Roman:</strong> He is, without a doubt, the exact same Servant! No doubt about it!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Is that so!? I&#39;m really troublesome!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Ah, putting that aside, Miss Ryougi? I&#39;m worried about that thing you have there.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Mystic Eyes of Death Perception, right? I heard they can cut down anything regardless of strength.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> They sever the very activity of living. They bring instant death, yet it&#39;s different than brain death or heart attack.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> I understand. I do understand... but they work on living things, right?</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Yet you&#39;re killing zombies who are not living. How is that possible?</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> That&#39;s my doubt! To kill dead people... It&#39;s complete nonsense!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> Hell if I know. It might look the same to humans, but ceasing to live and dying are two different things.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> Doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s zombies or ghosts, they&#39;re moving... If they are moving, that means they are “living.”</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> If it&#39;s alive, no matter what, death will come. May it be oblivion or disintegration.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> My eyes don&#39;t make any distinctions between those things.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> That is... Painful! You have gone through much, Miss Ryougi!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> Not really. It&#39;s better than becoming a demon in order to continue living, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> —Oh. You&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> —Stop Fujimaru! Watch your front and not just your back!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;m detecting a Servant! Not in the room, it&#39;s in the corridor—</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> There&#39;s someone at the end of it!</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Hey, good evening, Mephisto. Are these the new tenants?</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Welcome to the grudge garden. Nice to meet you. I&#39;ve met you before, haven&#39;t I?</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> I&#39;m Jekyll from Room 4. I&#39;m the manager of this corridor, too.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> You just arrived, so you haven&#39;t mutated, right? You&#39;re not ready to go upstairs.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> It is better to stay on the first floor a little longer. It&#39;s a little cold, but you&#39;ll get used to it.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Do you want to rest a little in my room? It is a bit untidy right now, but you can use it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Master... That Jekyll... is scary... I can&#39;t explain it, but he&#39;s very—</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Yeah, his eyes aren&#39;t laughing.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> His shirt is covered in blood.</p><hr><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Whaaat? Mephisto don&#39;t wanna go! Me don&#39;t like dirty room.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Dirty room? Is that a dirty room? It&#39;s no good. It&#39;s no good at all!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> I like to expose people&#39;s fetishes, but I don&#39;t like looking at them.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> So, please, Master, decline Jekyll&#39;s invitation. He&#39;s not suitable as a Servant in the first place.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> If you know it&#39;s dirty, clean it up! Or perhaps...</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Scrupulous Jekyll is sleeping? You&#39;re someone who can&#39;t clean up?</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Uh... Well, to tell you the truth, you&#39;re right. I&#39;m bad at cleaning up, and besides...</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong> It gets dirty and red instantly! I can&#39;t clean it up every single time, right?!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Shiki!</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong> I see, someone here totally gets it!</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong> But that was a perfect surprise attack! Why the hell would you block that!?</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong> Anyway, I see that you&#39;re the same as me!</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong> Pretending to be normal, but you&#39;re just a mass murderer who&#39;s craving to cut people&#39;s heads off!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> ...Tch, what was that? Disappointing... And here I was looking forward to this fated encounter.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> Before I knew it, I was at Ogawa Heim. I was already a Servant.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> Facing countless ghosts and their grudges, running into a strange Master.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> Ah, yes... Fujimaru and Mash are good. It&#39;s not that bad yet.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> But I wasn&#39;t satisfied. That much I know.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> The only reason I could remain motivated was because I had a hunch! That I might run into the real thing.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> The one who came before. The world famous mass murderer with dual personalities!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> But what&#39;s this? Are you kidding me? Why did you transform? I thought we could enjoy some time together. I&#39;m shocked.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> Hey, please turn back to that kind-looking guy. That one is probably stronger, and I prefer him.</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong> What? Do you prefer that moron over me? Why? Are you sure? This is the real me!</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong> From that weak Jekyll, I become the strong Hyde! The one who&#39;s good with the knife is me, you know?!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> ...Hah. That&#39;s enough, tell him, Scissors. I think you can understand me.</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong> ...What?</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Okay, okay. I understand you completely! Yes, I do, I understand you, miss!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Mr. Hyde, this is what she&#39;s saying. Don&#39;t show the ace up your sleeve too quickly. If you do that, it&#39;s basically saying, “This is my limit.”</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> It&#39;s more fun to watch a good human fight while suppressing his own demons, as we still don&#39;t know what will happen!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> The catharsis of collapse, was it?</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> I serve under the Master because I want to witness that explosive moment!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> If you want to play with a beast that is aggressive from the start you can go to a savannah!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> That&#39;s what she wants to see! It&#39;s not the mass murders committed by Hyde.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> ...But the immoral crimes committed by the good Jekyll as he cries tears of regret. Now that&#39;s ecstasy!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> ...I&#39;m an idiot to have let you talk. You&#39;re completely wrong. Get out of my way.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Mephy, shocked!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> But I do prefer the goodie-goodie looking one. It&#39;s like the difference between fighting for fun and fighting for your life.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> If you have to kill, it&#39;s more enthralling to fight desperately, right?</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> In other words, you are not enough. Come back again another time...</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong> HAH! I see, I see! You can&#39;t enjoy it if it&#39;s not serious!?</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong> You&#39;re one crazy lady! Then, let&#39;s have fun with this little dance!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE-</strong></p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Ugh... Hyde came out again... Sorry... Hyde and I were manipulated...</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Fujimaru, be careful with Mephisto... He cannot be trusted...</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Oh? Me? No, no. Don&#39;t you know I&#39;m a changed man?</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Wait, I can&#39;t change! I mean, I am already the good Mephy!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> If I change, I will become the evil one! Nope, not changing, not ever going to chaaaaaaannnge.</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Ugh... What is this, I can&#39;t maintain my body... My eyes... It&#39;s all dark...</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Fujimaru, give me your hand, please... I have something that I have to give you...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (Offer your hand to Jekyll)</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Good... You have the heart to trust people... You are the Master I&#39;ve always hoped for.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Master?!</p><hr><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> Come on, take this key. Use it to go to the upper floor—</p><p><strong>Jekyll:</strong> But before you go... Dieeeee!</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong> Ggg—!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> Thanks. I will gladly accept this key.</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong> Y-Yooouu! Twice! You ruined my surprise attack twice!</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong> I&#39;m amazed that you can&#39;t even fulfill a dying pretty boy&#39;s wish! Don&#39;t you have the heart to trust people?!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> If you were your normal self, I would&#39;ve been deceived, or rather moved, by your kindness.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> But neither happened to me this time. I mean... You&#39;ve been one personality the whole time.</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong> —Ugh. Don&#39;t tell me, you already knew?!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> I wanted to meet the famous Doctor Jekyll, but he is not here.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> Instead of having a split personality, you were acting like someone with dual personalities.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> As a fan, you can&#39;t blame me for being disappointed, can you?</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong> Ah... Dammit that&#39;s embarrassing. It&#39;s even more embarrassing than me losing in a knife fight.</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong> I&#39;d bury my head in the sand if I could. But looks like I don&#39;t need to do that, right?</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong> Considering there&#39;s a dangerous fan here, I guess I shall take my leave.</p><p><strong>Hyde:</strong> See ya, mass murderer of the present. Just be careful and make sure you don&#39;t become a knock-off.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Enemy Servant eliminated. Um... What was that just now?</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> I don&#39;t know. Hey Scissors, say something.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Hehehe! Not that it&#39;s important, so I will keep it in two lines!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Dr. Jekyll fully mutated when he arrived at this apartment. Both his body and soul rotted away, so he died!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Doctor Jekyll is a Servant with a split personality... So what you&#39;re saying is that his main personality is gone already?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> So Hyde, who survived, was acting like Doctor Jekyll... Just like how his story ended... So sad.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But what do you mean by mutated?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Jekyll was a Servant who transformed into Hyde with drugs, but it seems you&#39;re not talking about those...</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Ah, I forgot to mention it. It is what makes this apartment special.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Certain characteristics? Past history? Criminal record? Hmmmmm, well, let&#39;s just keep that vague.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Anyway, if certain Servants stay here, their alignment will change, and become more resentful.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> I myself was changed that way! Even if I want to fight, I took an arrow to the shin! Ow!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Changing Heroic Spirits&#39; alignment?! Is that like a new way of tampering with parameters?!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Yes. Well, they get angry easily so it&#39;s more like stress level? Like lowering the boiling point?</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> So it&#39;s not really that harmful. However—</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> For the people that ended their life full of resentment and sadness, this place will work wonders!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Heroic Spirits ending up as evil ghosts due to their own resentment for humans... Isn&#39;t that ironic?</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Yes, even the evil me used that and asked those kinds of Servants to come here.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> As you can see, all the Servants that moved here went crazy, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Th-That&#39;s not very nice! Bad Mephisto! You&#39;re guilty!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Hehe, I was just doing my job as a real estate agent! The guilty ones are this land, this building, and the mastermind!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> When we meet again, it&#39;ll be in court.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> I can&#39;t believe it... You have a contract with a Servant who was a judge?</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Will the jury be full of homunculi? I mean, human trials can be tough, you know?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Mastermind?</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Oops, I was caught by Mash&#39;s beauty and said too much. Zipping my mouth now.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> You will find out yourselves when you go to the upper floors! I think!</p><hr><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> —</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Oh. Did you smile? Why?</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> It&#39;s fun with Fujimaru around, clown. When we have fun guests, my tension blows up!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Is it possible? I&#39;m always hyper like this, hyahoo!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> I can see that. Fine, now we can go upstairs, right?</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> Let&#39;s move forward, Fujimaru. It seems the real fight starts now.</p><h2 id="_2nd-floor-room-no-4" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2nd-floor-room-no-4" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 2nd Floor, Room No.4</h2><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Hellooo, I&#39;m coming in! Oohhh! Now this is good! I like &#39;em charred!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> And it&#39;s smelly in here! The smell of my kind! The kind that committed a crime, and thus was labeled as a monster...</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> ...then ridiculed and feared by all! The kind that couldn&#39;t escape their punishment even after death!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> —Hah! Well put! You&#39;re absolutely right, clown.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> But why are you here? To give me a housewarming present? Is it because I crawled back to a dark brick room?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Elisabeth... No... I am sure you already know...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai, that&#39;s not the Elisabeth you know. She&#39;s already a being completely different than her original self...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Yes, I am a genuine Innocent Monster! Clown, you sure brought me something delicious-looking.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Good, you&#39;re so considerate! Let&#39;s see... I&#39;m in the mood now!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> What was today&#39;s party supposed to be? Oh well, doesn&#39;t matter! It&#39;s a feast!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> I can take off your hands and feet while you&#39;re still alive, like shrimps, okay? Burn your organs from the inside like pigs?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Yes! Then I&#39;ll kill you! Let&#39;s kill, let&#39;s do it, humans!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> She&#39;s coming, Senpai! I know it&#39;s Elisabeth, but please fight with everything you&#39;ve got!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE-</strong></p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Ugh... That hurts... That hurts... That hurts!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> ...Stop it! Don&#39;t let me know...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Don&#39;t let me know that it hurts this much when my stomach is cut open! Don&#39;t force that on me!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> So what if you tell me that other people would share the same pain! What do you expect me to do?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Why?! Why am I the only one miserable?! No matter what I do, why can&#39;t I be saved?!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> If you say you&#39;re humans, wouldn&#39;t that make me a more lowly beast?!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Like a lizard, like a lizard, like a lizard... Are you telling me to crawl on the floor and get stepped on and crushed?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> I can&#39;t stand it. I will not be able to stand it!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> So, please let me kill you. Die already. Please, I beg of you, don&#39;t hesitate and KILL ME ALREADY!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Servant Elisabeth has been eliminated. But... That was...</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Yes, those were always her real feelings! For me it only sounded like a scream!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> But I am sure it was a good outlet for her. Her...pride? Or should I call it dignity?</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> It must be the result of the education she received as an aristocrat. The ruling class is not allowed to lament.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> “Those who stand over others must shoulder suitable responsibility.” I am sure that idea was etched onto her.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> She picked herself up after falling, trying to aim for the top only to fall again, covered in mud. Yet she picked herself up again.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> It looks like she keeps repeating the process as her atonement. Hmmm, kind of like a dragon that keeps collecting shining treasure in its dungeon.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> That&#39;s why, don&#39;t mind the ugly side of her you&#39;ve just witnessed. Next time you see her...</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> ...just say, “Your horns are pretty cute,” and everything will be okay!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...Really? If that was her repressed scream, wouldn&#39;t that eventually poison her and turn her into a real monste... Whoa! What&#39;s going on?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> T-T-Trouble, Romani! I don&#39;t know why, but Elisabeth all of sudden charged into my workshop!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> And she started saying, “I just woke up, and somehow I am feeling really refreshed!”</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> “That&#39;s why I made you some snacks to show my appreciation for you! Come eat them! Eat them with gratitude in your heart!”</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Oh no, it&#39;s melting! Why is the sauce from that plate burning my Mona Lisa?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Help me Romani! I can&#39;t deal with her by myself! No... Why is this happening...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Did she just roast three golems and turn them into a bunch of cookies?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Okay, there&#39;s nothing to worry! Chaldea is as peaceful as ever, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Don&#39;t worry and keep investigating that apartment. I won&#39;t worry about what just happened either and focus on backing you up.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> R-Right.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> If only we had Marugoshi David here...</p><hr><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> See? You can punch her all you want but she gets back up.

Are you also...</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> You can&#39;t come in without ringing the bell. As your big sis, I have to scold you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai! Thank goodness! Boudica hasn&#39;t changed!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Reliable, kind, and warm hugs galore! That&#39;s our Boudica!</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> What? Oh, Mash, is that what you think of me? Someone who hugs at every possible chance?</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> Anyway. I just made a stew. Will you have some with me, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yes, of course.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Eat up, so we can all go home.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes! You are way past your limit, Senpai. I think it&#39;s good for you to replenish some energy.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> After we finish our meal, let&#39;s go back to Chaldea for the time being. We also have to bring Boudica back—</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> —Go back? What are you talking about, Mash?</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> Don&#39;t joke around with me. Who said I would go back?</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> I won&#39;t go back. There&#39;s no place for me to go back to. That&#39;s because... Everything... YOU TOOK EVERYTHING!</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> We were the king&#39;s only family. My daughter and I were all he had!</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> That&#39;s why I was going to inherit the throne... Yet I was told women have no right to inheritance...</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> YOU BASTARDS! YOU ROMANS TOOK EVERYTHING FROM ME!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Boudica...</p><p><strong>Boudica:</strong> I had forgotten.

This pressure, this evil magical energy I am sensing...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s a Servant more chaotic-evil than Mephisto here!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Hyahoo! Exactly! That there is the evil Dark Knight, the crow that devours the dead.</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong> ...No, wait!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I get chills just from the gaze beyond that helmet!

Oh I can&#39;t stop laughing! Hehehe, kill, let&#39;s kill!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Inside that armor is probably a hollow shell like the ghosts outside, or a bony skeleton!</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong> ...Hey! Who are you calling a bony skeleton?</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong> Feast your eyes upon this body! One that belongs to the King of Storms, the protector of the holy lance!</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong> LOOK! CLOSELY!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> (Completely stunned by her taking off her armor)</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Whoa! Time to record this!

Have we met before?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Didn&#39;t we fight in that massive cavern before?</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong> ...Indeed. You are very perceptive, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong> That was a different aspect of myself, but still the same person.</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong> Your perceptiveness deserves a compliment. You show much promise. However...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I don&#39;t remember you. I mean those breasts...</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong> (Her eyes are saying, “I will kill you if you finish that sentence.”)</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fo...Fou...</p><hr><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong> Unlike my armor, my patience is wearing thin. Especially when it comes to humiliation.</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong> You ruffians have witnessed a king&#39;s face. Since it has come to that, a fight cannot be avoided.</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong> I shall forgive your disrespect if you can survive and prove your bravery to me. If you can&#39;t, your soul will be mine.</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong> I am the King of Storms, the Wild Hunt itself! All those who witness my face shall become my servant.</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong> My limbs, my offerings... Cry as you gather under me.

You too, Shiki! Be prepared!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> Ah, yes, thank you, you saved me! She almost gave me a heart attack!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> What the hell is she doing on a horse in an apartment! That&#39;s creepier than any ghosts in this place!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE-</strong></p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong> ...Insolent fool. The eyes that can see death, huh? To think my servants will be disposed of so easily.</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong> If she&#39;s with you then you can win. I have no more reasons to stop you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master, Lancer Alter has lowered her spear.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Unlike the other Servants, maybe she still hasn&#39;t mutated?</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Of course she hasn&#39;t. I mean, she&#39;s just not cut out for it.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> How should I put this... The heart that&#39;s not afraid to go all out? The courage to pursue desires? Kind of like the class president?</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> No matter how strong she becomes, she never seems to turn into a cruel queen.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Unless you pour ale into the Holy Grail and have her drink it, she will never become a villain.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s very much like her. But why is she blocking our way?</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong> ...Hmm. I can&#39;t let people without light tread into the darkness.</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong> I am here to filter the people who can&#39;t resist against the grudge in this place.</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong> But with that woman around, any immortal will face death.</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong> That&#39;s why I will allow you to proceed. Besides...</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong> Even with a light, it&#39;s common to be eaten by beasts. I will enjoy watching how far you can go.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Wow, what a scary laugh... She looks like a cruel queen to me... Cruel enough...</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong> You talk too much, mage. Small talk is strictly prohibited. Instead of speaking, keep moving!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fou!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Ouch, she scolded me... She&#39;s like a class president alright. Now for the necessary questions.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Heroic Spirit of the Holy Spear. Why are you here? Did Mephisto trick you into coming, too?</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong> I don&#39;t know about that. I came of my own free will.</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong> ...This is the tower that gathers grudges. It is the cenotaph that imprisons death.</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong> Originally it should&#39;ve been drowned in the darkness of history. But someone dug it up, and tried to convert it to a Singularity.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Someone... It&#39;s probably the same person who&#39;s incinerated humanity. But you said they tried, did they fail?</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong> ...This is what you will find out from your investigation. Indeed, the King&#39;s plan ended in miscalculation.</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong> That&#39;s probably because he sent the wrong man for the job. As a result, this place did not turn into a Singularity.</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong> Instead, it became a tower that attracts and imprisons Servants, turning them into demons.</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong> There are many types of death that come here. Someday, it will become the Singularity called “Hell.”</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> So this is the gate of Hell, right? That means I am most suitable to be your guide!</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong> Now, even if a Hell wasn&#39;t created here, one already exists. Adding one or two more holes to it wouldn&#39;t be a problem. However...</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong> If you can&#39;t overlook that fact, then do whatever you see fit.</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong> This place has no effect on the incineration of humanity. The mutation of the Servants is the result of their own doing.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...That&#39;s what she thinks... What should we do, Senpai?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Of course, we will go up.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> We can&#39;t abandon our Servants.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Roger! I will go with you, Master!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> ...Even if it won&#39;t cause any harm to you, you&#39;ll still intervene? You sure are a curious one.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> Or are you just nosy? Chaldea is more laid-back than I thought.</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong> That&#39;s not it. It is my duty as a king. An inferior being like you wouldn&#39;t understand.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> Don&#39;t be ridiculous. Even inferior civilians have their path! Especially, when it&#39;s related to our own territory.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> Oh well... We&#39;ve already defeated the large chested woman, so let&#39;s go ahead Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> If we keep looking at those things, it&#39;ll mess up our sense of scale! More than enough is too much, you know?</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong> Heh. No one who has more than enough says that. I will accept it as sour grapes.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> Okay, okay. Ah, how about that Room No. 4? That is your room, right? Can we go inside?</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> You clean it up everyday, right?</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong> Eh—?</p><p><strong>Lancer Alter:</strong> No! Absolutely not!

Why would you walk around killing ghosts?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> They were unrewarded in life, and their regrets keep them away from death.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> The defeated who were abandoned by life, and left behind by death. They chose emptiness over peacefulness.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...Yes, they are nameless, formless monsters.

Let&#39;s not say anything, Mash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...You&#39;re right. She seems to have her reasons.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...But that kimono was so beautiful. I wish I could&#39;ve asked her more questions.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Shiki, you&#39;re a magical girl?</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> Magical girl? What are you talking about? I&#39;m too old to be a “girl” anyway.</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, foou!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> Oh, what is it, Fou? You want praise, too? ...Wait, what&#39;s that? A key?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Seems like it was hidden here. Good work, Fou. (Pat, pat)</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Oh my! It seems Shiki wants to touch his fur, too! Go ahead and touch my cape, then!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> My cape is an exquisite item made from 100% devil hair!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Come on, touch it! It&#39;s gorgeous!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> ...Fine. I guess it&#39;ll have to do. Let me touch it.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Oh no! Mephy&#39;s in danger! You just tried to sever my cuticles, didn&#39;t you!?</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> Oh, sorry. I couldn&#39;t help myself. That long hair was annoying me.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> You&#39;re doing it all wrong! You use scissors to cut hair! Your knife would shave my entire head bald!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> I try very hard to be a dandy gentleman! I&#39;ll defend my hair to the death!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> !!! It&#39;s a fashion statement!?</p><h2 id="_5th-floor-room-no-4" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_5th-floor-room-no-4" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 5th Floor, Room No.4</h2><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...The Spiritron density&#39;s highest on this floor. Looks like we&#39;re at the center of this apartment.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> We&#39;ve defeated dozens of ghosts so far, but this response is far bigger than any of them.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The core that created this fake Singularity... The soul, or Spirit Origin if you will, of this area.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> And it&#39;s close. Be careful, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Understood. ...We&#39;re almost at the end of the hallway.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That room seems to be the last one... Shiki, are you picking up anything.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> Listen, the only thing I&#39;m picking up is cold shivers. I can&#39;t detect magical energy like Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> It&#39;s more like intuition for me. That, and how much death there is.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Whether there&#39;s death, huh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You haven&#39;t talked about it, but what does it feel like to see death?</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> It&#39;s creepy, basically. I told you before, what I see is a thing&#39;s lifespan.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> ...Everything has a seam.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> Those seams usually look like lines. Run a knife down them and that part will “die.”</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> If you have time, you can ask a mage you know for the more detailed theory.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> In my case, I happened to know this weird mage. She told me all kinds of stuff I didn&#39;t want to know.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> ...Well, I&#39;ll probably never see her again. But maybe you have someone who knows her?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I don&#39;t know. Chaldea&#39;s got a lot of funds, but we&#39;re basically isolated in the mountains.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Anyway, were you born with those eyes? Have you been seeing that scary view since you were born?</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> I was born with them, but they didn&#39;t awaken until I got into an accident.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> I basically died once. When I woke up, the whole world had changed.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> ...Tch. Why are we talking about me, anyway? Look, we&#39;re here. This is the center of the building.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Hehehe! At last we&#39;re here! Yes, yes, this is it! This is it!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> I remember this place! I was first summoned here!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...So there&#39;s something here that&#39;s creating this fake Singularity, right?</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Of course! It wouldn&#39;t make sense if there wasn&#39;t!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Who could it be? I&#39;m so excited! I&#39;m so nervous, everyone! Aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> —Yes. It&#39;s not appropriate to say this, but I&#39;m interested.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Thanks to you, I&#39;m not as nervous now, Mephisto.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;re a pro at livening things up, Mephisto.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It was a little bit noisy though.</p><hr><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Hehehe! Of course! I&#39;m talking as much as usual for your sake, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> That means he&#39;s just acting like his normal self!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> So you won&#39;t change your ways for anything, huh? You really do seem to be having fun, though.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Of course I am.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> I&#39;m with a Master who&#39;ll hang out with a devil like me, even if they do think I&#39;m a little weird!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> How could this not be fun!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> This is so fun! I&#39;m so happy! It&#39;s really like a dream come true!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> ...Yeah. You&#39;re being honest for once, huh Scissors?</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> Okay. Let&#39;s go inside. Are you ready, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Of course.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> What is this room!? There&#39;s no boundary lines!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It&#39;s like Scáthach&#39;s Land of Shadows! If we don&#39;t stop this thing—</p><p><strong>Evil Mephisto:</strong> Welcome, everyone! Have you been satisfied so far?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> —Huh?</p><p><strong>Good Mephisto:</strong> Of course we have! Hello, me! Thanks for watching the Boundary!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, foou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Another set of Mephistos!? Even though we got rid of the evil one!?</p><p><strong>Good Mephisto:</strong> What are you saying, lady Mash? I&#39;ll ask you not to underestimate me.</p><p><strong>Good Mephisto:</strong> I am a devil! I&#39;ve only got a single good heart within me—</p><p><strong>Good Mephisto:</strong> But I&#39;ve got far more than one or two hearts of evil! I&#39;ve got so many you couldn&#39;t count them all!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s surprisingly convincing! I have no come back to that, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s Mephisto. What can you do?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> We just have to keep punching him until he reforms.</p><hr><p><strong>Good Mephisto:</strong> Yes, perfect! I wanted to see you go around defeating all the evil mes.</p><p><strong>Good Mephisto:</strong> That&#39;s why I came here in the first place!</p><p><strong>Good Mephisto:</strong> Come, come! Go right ahead! Behind that evil me is a Greater Ghost.</p><p><strong>Good Mephisto:</strong> That&#39;s the keystone of this Bounded Field! The Great Avici Hell, which draws spirits of the dead here and turns them into a pillar!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> ...It&#39;s huge. How hard is it gonna be for that to die? There&#39;s so many lines I could never cut them all!</p><p><strong>Evil Mephisto:</strong> Hehehe! Of course it&#39;s hard! It&#39;s a copy-paste of over a hundred million deaths!</p><p><strong>Evil Mephisto:</strong> And you&#39;re going to join the other ghosts in it! But before that—</p><p><strong>Evil Mephisto:</strong> There&#39;s something I don&#39;t quite understand. I&#39;m talking about you, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Evil Mephisto:</strong> Say, why are you doing all of this? This isn&#39;t your problem at all.</p><p><strong>Evil Mephisto:</strong> It&#39;s true that Servants were trapped here. But they mutated of their own will.</p><p><strong>Evil Mephisto:</strong> They all wanted to be that way. There was no need for you to go to considerable length to come and save them.</p><p><strong>Evil Mephisto:</strong> This apartment is located in a different dimension, yes. But it&#39;s only a fake Singularity. It&#39;s safe to ignore.</p><p><strong>Evil Mephisto:</strong> Even if humanity&#39;s foundations were restored, this place would simply sit outside the world and quietly gather hatred and pain.</p><p><strong>Evil Mephisto:</strong> Looking at this sort of hell is my job, which is why I&#39;m here working.</p><p><strong>Evil Mephisto:</strong> But why are you getting involved? No one asked you. And this isn&#39;t revenge.</p><p><strong>Evil Mephisto:</strong> There&#39;s nothing to be gained for you by solving this problem!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> —</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Well...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Everyone looks like they&#39;re suffering.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> A hobby. Just like you.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> —Right! It doesn&#39;t matter what we gain! It felt like we needed to solve this!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s the kind of person Senpai is! Someone who can&#39;t look away from pain and sadness.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I still remember Senpai holding my hand that day when I was scared in the Command Room...</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> Everyone looks like they&#39;re suffering, huh? And I guess “everyone” includes the ghosts.</p><p><strong>Evil Mephisto:</strong> —SIGH. Then I guess I&#39;ll have no choice but to kill you.</p><p><strong>Evil Mephisto:</strong> I am a devil. It&#39;s no fun if someone does something just because they want to.</p><p><strong>Evil Mephisto:</strong> I can&#39;t tempt them with anything. Which means I can&#39;t trade with them!</p><p><strong>Evil Mephisto:</strong> And in the face of someone like that, you know... I would have no choice but to truly submit!</p><p><strong>Evil Mephisto:</strong> And if I was loyal like that, I wouldn&#39;t be a devil anymore, would I?</p><p><strong>Evil Mephisto:</strong> I am here as myself.</p><p><strong>Evil Mephisto:</strong> As long as I&#39;m needed as the devil Mephisto Pheles... It would be rude to my wonderful Master not to do my job!</p><p><strong>Good Mephisto:</strong> Ooh, that&#39;s me for you! A devil more devilish than any devil!</p><p><strong>Good Mephisto:</strong> But as the me on Master&#39;s side, this is a problem. I don&#39;t think I can beat that Greater Ghost.</p><p><strong>Good Mephisto:</strong> The evil devil me wants to be defeated by my Master. The good devil me just wants to survive and doesn&#39;t care about anyone else.</p><p><strong>Good Mephisto:</strong> What is this? Mixing both me together would make me look like the strongest, wouldn&#39;t it!?</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> Idiot. Just shut up and work with us. It&#39;s the only way you&#39;ll survive.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> Let&#39;s do it, Mash, Scissors. Fujimaru&#39;s answer persuaded me.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> I&#39;d been wondering the whole time, too.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> Fujimaru has a place to call home. Why get involved in someone else&#39;s hell?</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> But I guess I know the answer now.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> This one is the same kind of idiot as Mikiya! So there&#39;s no sense in thinking about it!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> Idiots never listen to you, after all! They just make everyone&#39;s lives difficult!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Right... right! I agree, Shiki! That&#39;s our Master!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> Then let&#39;s finish this thing!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> I&#39;m thinking that I want to go to this Chaldea of yours!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE-</strong></p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The massive ghost has vanished! Now the fake Singularity is done for!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> Bye now, lying devil. Time for you to head back home!</p><p><strong>Evil Mephisto:</strong> Ayye—yeee! It&#39;s so sharp!</p><p><strong>Evil Mephisto:</strong> So this is a death line!? It&#39;s so sharp, huh miss?</p><p><strong>Evil Mephisto:</strong> It&#39;s a clean cut! I didn&#39;t feel anything and there&#39;s no blood! But there&#39;s terror and pleasure!</p><p><strong>Evil Mephisto:</strong> Oh, I have to disappear! I can&#39;t take it anymore!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The enemy Servant and massive ghost have been eliminated. —We won, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Good work, everyone.</p><hr><p><strong>Good Mephisto:</strong> Hehe. Hehehehe!</p><p><strong>Good Mephisto:</strong> Good work! Good work, huh? An airhead until the end, you are!</p><p><strong>Good Mephisto:</strong> But that&#39;s unforgettable, unattainable, and I want to die! Good work! And farewell!</p><p><strong>Good Mephisto:</strong> Though... When you&#39;re a devil like me you don&#39;t do farewells like this often!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Good Mephisto!? W-Why are you starting to disappear?</p><p><strong>Good Mephisto:</strong> Why? That&#39;s a strange question Killing that me means killing this me as well!</p><p><strong>Good Mephisto:</strong> Listen, if you defeat an evil heart, the good heart isn&#39;t going to somehow survive, okay?</p><p><strong>Good Mephisto:</strong> I am me because of my evil. And I am me because of my good.</p><p><strong>Good Mephisto:</strong> You are who you are because of your strengths. I am who I am because of my weaknesses.</p><p><strong>Good Mephisto:</strong> It&#39;s best to disappear together. That is what we are.</p><p><strong>Good Mephisto:</strong> Because—if only one of us were to survive, that would be a sad thing.</p><p><strong>Good Mephisto:</strong> They say a man can&#39;t live by himself! Although, I am a devil!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> —</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> ...Yeah. Did you have fun, Scissors?</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Yes, I did! The best days of my devilish life! Um, yes. Enough that I&#39;m going to miss it.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Anyway, I will be off! I&#39;ll be joining the ghosts!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> No, I&#39;ll see you soon, Mephisto Pheles.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;ll summon you soon.</p><hr><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Hehehe. Hehehehe. That&#39;s wrong. That&#39;s a different me. Not this me.</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> I&#39;m not human. In fact, I was never human at all—</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> So I don&#39;t remember what happened yesterday, and I probably won&#39;t remember you!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> That&#39;s what a devil is! Either they destroy the one they contract with, or that one will destroy them!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Nothing remains. For if it did, it would weigh on me. I wouldn&#39;t be able to have fun deceiving you, Master!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Goodbye, everyone— The devil Mephisto Pheles will be leaving now!</p><p><strong>Mephisto:</strong> Splendid, splendid work, Fujimaru! You have done well to awaken from the sleep of death!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Heroic Spirit Mephisto Pheles is gone. It&#39;s over, Shiki, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> Over? Well, I guess it is.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> Once that massive ghost is gone, this apartment building will go back to being abandoned.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> When the time comes, there&#39;ll be nothing left. Like what Scissors said, that&#39;s life.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. It is a little lonely, though.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> Okay. Let&#39;s head back to this Chaldea place, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> No, should I call you Master? That&#39;s the rule for Servants, right?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Huh? You&#39;re coming too?</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> What, am I not welcome? I&#39;ve helped you this far. ...Not that it was my main goal.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> I was troubled too.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> I thought I&#39;d wake up if I found the cause, but it&#39;s not happening. Instead, I feel more alert than ever.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> This place is going to disappear soon. So Chaldea&#39;s the only place I can go.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> If I work for you as a Servant, then you can give me lodgings, food, and clothing, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s true...We can&#39;t just leave her. Senpai?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Welcome to Chaldea.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Thanks for coming, Ryougi.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Right! Thanks for working with us, Shiki!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> Thanks. Okay, let&#39;s get going.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> If you need ghosts, zombies, or anything else weird taken out, I&#39;m the one. Use me as you like.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> Thanks, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> I won&#39;t go as far as Scissors, but I&#39;ll follow you to the gates of Hell.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Damn... Another weirdo, huh?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> But it&#39;s good that Chaldea will be livelier. I&#39;ll get her a room ready quickly.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Fujimaru, good work. I can see the fake Singularity response beginning to weaken.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The massive ghost maintaining it vanished. That apartment building will vanish soon.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The Servants who were trapped will come back when the building disappears.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> If you forgot anything, take care of it. Chaldea always needs more resources.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> But don&#39;t spend too much time there! I&#39;ll be waiting for you in the Command Room!</p><h2 id="_6th-floor-room-no-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_6th-floor-room-no-1" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 6th Floor, Room No.1</h2><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Excuse the intrusion!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Good morning!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Although we resolved the incident, it seems there are still some Servants trapped inside the building.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So we continued our search and rescue efforts, but... but...</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong> Uuuu...

All because that black-haired bastard suggested we try it out...</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> Yes... It&#39;s just so useful... And vast... And stimulating...

Oh, that? To be honest, that was the cause...</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> It is not as if I settled here of my own volition. I got into a quarrel with my mentor.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> I can&#39;t leave just yet. When I told her, “Act your age,” I was hit with the full force of her fury.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> I tell you, I haven&#39;t mixed it up with my mentor like that since I was her disciple in the Land of Shadows!</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> There was also Fergus, Ferdia, and I believe 20 others. My mentor announced it out of the blue. As a final test.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> “All of you, slay me right now. If you cannot, you will die. For I am going to slaughter the lot of you.”</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> That&#39;s what she said. I suppose it was to weed out the weaker warriors, but I wish she hadn&#39;t been that serious.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Tell me about it. I hate her Stun.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> Oh, you&#39;ve fought her before somewhere?! What a misfortune!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> So, did you win then?</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> If we hadn&#39;t, neither Uncle Fergus, Ferdia nor I would have been around to become Heroic Spirits.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> It took all of us. Normally, she would have beaten us.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> But the thing is, afterwards... She easily wiped us out...</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> Don&#39;t tell anyone I told you this, understand? That woman hides one side of her true character.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> “You have done well. You fools have finally become half-fledged warriors. But... I still have one stage of transformation left.”</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> That&#39;s what she said before sending us flying. I&#39;m telling you, we were like scraps of paper.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> ...And this time was like a reenactment of that. She laid waste to my Wicker Man.</p><hr><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> Long story short, I lost to my mentor and was imprisoned here.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> She told me to think about what I did for a while. Treating me like the monkey in that story...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You mean China&#39;s famous story of the Five Elements Mountain, with the Monkey King?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I sympathize with your situation, Cú Chulainn, but I think you&#39;re also to blame.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You should never casually bring up a woman&#39;s age. Especially if she cares about what people think of her.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn:</strong> That is a fine warning!

Are you capable of destroying an indestructible phenomenon?</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> Even if something exists for millions of years, it&#39;s only the false impression of eternal youth that humans project on it.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> But all things possess the seed of destruction.

The time has come to devour your prey.”</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> He held no grudge... What does that mean? I&#39;m confused... Well then, what is the point of incinerating mankind&#39;s history?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Why don&#39;t you find the answer yourselves? I have no interest in the matter.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Master. The enemy Servant will disappear.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Wait!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Please, just tell me who you are!</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong> I&#39;m not obligated to say anything.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...Hmph. But, if you insist... The only thing I have to say is this.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> “Attendre et espérer...” Wait and hope.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...It is finally over. The mastermind who was gathering all the ghosts is finally gone.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> This apartment will return to its incinerated history... The long night will finally end.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s good news, but... We still have no idea who that Servant was.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> He made it sound like he was our enemy... I wonder if we will have to fight again someday?</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> Who knows? One victory might be all that&#39;s needed for that type of guy. He might turn out to be an unexpectedly trustworthy ally.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Really?</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> That&#39;s right. Mash, do you know why human beings take revenge on others?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> N-No. I can&#39;t quite recall at the moment the motivation behind the act of revenge...</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> It&#39;s simple. A human being holds a grudge when they have been betrayed by someone they love. If the other person is someone they don&#39;t care about, they would be indifferent.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> So... Maybe that guy in black actually loves humanity on a fundamental level?</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> The one born from hatred speaks of love, and the one born from love speaks of hatred.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> That&#39;s the type of guy he is, I&#39;m sure.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Yes. Perhaps we&#39;ll encounter him again someday. For now, let&#39;s hope that we have solved this case once and for all.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m glad we were able to solve the case!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, foou!</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> Yeah. The investigation did take a lot of legwork. Your perseverance exceeded my expectations.</p><p><strong>Ryougi Shiki:</strong> Come to my house if you lose your job as a Master. We...have a detective, so we&#39;ll hire you as an assistant.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Dr. Roman, don&#39;t tell me it&#39;s you!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Hmm, I don&#39;t know about that. If I can remote control someone from here, I think I can be a lot more useful to you guys.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Anyway, good work, everyone. You were all able to persevere and continue the search until the end.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> There&#39;s nothing left to do now, and the distortion in the coordinates should eventually disappear.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;ll be waiting for all of you in Chaldea. The Case of Ogawa Heim has come to a close!</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div><footer class="page-meta"><div class="meta-item edit-link"><a class="external-link meta-item-label" href="https://github.com/r-grandorder/wiki/edit/main/src/Events/2018/knk.md" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" aria-label="Help us improve this page!"><!--[--><!--]--> Help us improve this page! <span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewbox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span><!--[--><!--]--></a></div><div class="meta-item last-updated"><span class="meta-item-label">Last Updated: </span><!----></div><div class="meta-item contributors"><span class="meta-item-label">Contributors: </span><span class="meta-item-info"><!--[--><!--[--><span class="contributor" title="email: 59034871+Fgrandorder@users.noreply.github.com">Lib</span><!----><!--]--><!--]--></span></div></footer><!----><!--[--><!--]--></main><!--]--></div><!----><!--]--></div>
