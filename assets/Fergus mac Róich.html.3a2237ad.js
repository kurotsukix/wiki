I&#39;m looking for the Servant Consultation Room. Is this it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> We&#39;re closed today...</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Hm, just as I thought. But I&#39;m begging you. It&#39;s urgent, you see.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Yes and no?</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Hah hah hah. You deny and say it isn&#39;t so, but your face tells me you&#39;ve given up on refusing, Master!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> You&#39;re probably fed up with indulging the selfishness of Servants day after day. I sympathize with you.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> So now, I&#39;d like you to just give up again. I&#39;ve got an urgent problem.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Could you hear me out?</p><hr><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Hah hah hah, don&#39;t be so shy!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> War is important, but whispering words of love to a woman is equally important to me.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Of course, I&#39;d never force myself on an unwilling woman. Understand that I just want to look at her and hit on her.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai, Senpai! I found sweet rice cakes in the Doctor&#39;s room!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> These are quite exceptional. Let&#39;s eat them before anyone finds out.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But of course, the main topic is investigating the Doctor.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We must solve the mystery of how the Doctor stockpiles sweets in this time of scarcity...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh? Is that you, Fergus?</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Oh, hello Mash. Well, I want to ask you, too.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> You see...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I understand the circumstances, but maybe that&#39;s not such a good idea.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I mean, we are fighting to prevent humanity&#39;s destruction...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> If you carelessly start hitting on other Servants, it may end in a bloodbath...</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Hmm, what a mess...</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> If at least I could tell which Servants are okay to hit on...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Heh, leave stuff like that to me. More like, why didn&#39;t you come see me about this?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Hey, those sweet rice cakes look pretty tasty. Let me try one, nom nom...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Oh, this is as tasty as the one from my own collection, or rather, it tastes exactly the same...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai&#39;s sweet rice cake!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Mash&#39;s sweet rice cake!</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> You two get along so well. That aside, Fergus.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I installed several Servant profiles into the virtual training system.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> They&#39;re a bit robotic, but they should at least respond to you.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> So try this out first, and if it looks good, you can go hit on them for real. How does that sound?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It will be good for future reference. I&#39;ll use the results for personal reference.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Hmm... An interesting proposal. Let&#39;s give it a shot!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai, Senpai. I&#39;m not sure why, but I have a bad feeling about this.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, foou...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Okay, transfer confirmed. Why don&#39;t you try sweet-talking the first one?</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> All right, bring it on! Now, what kind of perky lass will appear\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Uhh. What&#39;s a \u201Cperky lass,\u201D exactly, Senpai?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Maybe a beauty that makes his crotch perk up? Oh, here she comes!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Well, if it isn&#39;t Brynhild, the Valkyrie! ...Hey, wait, wait, wait!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Don&#39;t you already have a boyfriend? I&#39;m not a fan of stealing another guy&#39;s woman...</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Hmm. Well, I don&#39;t like it, but exceptions must be made for lust.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Brynhild. I want you. Why don&#39;t you spend the night with me?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (...A very straightforward and completely unambiguous approach...)</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> Oh...I don&#39;t know how to respond to such a frank confession of love\u2013</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Hmmm.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> I guess I&#39;ll just have to kill you...</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Yup, I don&#39;t get why, but so be it! You&#39;re even more ferocious in love than the Celts!</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> I have no idea who you are, but thank you. Now let us fight to the death...</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Fujimaru, Mash, my bad! I was so close, but I failed!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We can see that. Oh geez, Master, get ready for battle!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That was quite the ordeal...</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Hah hah hah, if you get depressed by one or two failures, you&#39;re gonna have a tough life.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> After all, everything, even life, is just a night&#39;s dream. You&#39;ve got to live decisively.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> How reliable... You are a teacher, no, I must say, a guru of smooth talkers...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> All right, Guru Fergus! I will prepare the next Servant!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> This time it&#39;ll be fine. Based on looks, I chose a charming, peaceful woman!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai, Senpai, I think he will strike out.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> I think so too, but I can&#39;t help it when met with such beauty! Hey there, foreign lady!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Ah, are you referring to me? I beg your pardon. Do you need something?</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Yes. I liked you the moment I saw you. How about it? Spending the night with me.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Oh, my. What shall I do...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Wait, he actually has a chance?</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Hahaha, no need to be shy.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> I don&#39;t mean to brag, but I, Fergus, am an acknowledged authority on how to make women happy\u2013</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> What did you just say?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> An acknowledged authority on making women happy? So, in other words\u2013you mean \u201Cinfidelity.\u201D</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> ...Hmm. Hah hah hah! My bad! It seems I&#39;ve stepped on a land mine, Master!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Guru Fergus\u2014!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> As I expected! You keep stumbling at the first hurdle!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Destroy infidelity! Destroy womanizers!</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Go repent in hell! Hi-yah!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Hmm, it&#39;s not going too well. I hope this time a compatible Servant will show up.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai, we should make a bet.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> MUDA MUDA MUDA.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I think it&#39;s no use.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, I think so as well.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Hah hah hah! Master, you&#39;re quite harsh. However, rest assured. This is a tent, thus, the wild.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Being here means it will most likely be a ferocious woman, a warrior!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> I know well how to woo such a woman. Well now, Doctor!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> An unshakable heart of steel... That is our hero Fergus!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Honestly, I&#39;m starting to realize this is useless, so I want to go back to work... But I hope for the best this time!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The Servant up next is\u2013her!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai, I think we should run.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> To the ends of the earth.</p><hr><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Oooh, is this not the nurse that took care of us in America?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> I only have business for the wounded. Please leave.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Don&#39;t be so cold. Actually... I have a serious illness.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> ...Let&#39;s hear it. What is wrong?</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Uh, it&#39;s like a gaping hole has opened in my chest...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Is it pneumothorax? Or perhaps heart failure?</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Nothing like that, it&#39;s more of a mental problem. I&#39;ve got an emptiness from the lonely nights spent alone.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> ...Meaning?</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Yes, I refer to the disease of love... My heart is unspeakably cold and empty!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> But, my beautiful lady with bosom so supple and buttocks so round!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> I do think you are capable of filling the gap in this chest. If you would, please!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Nightingale, um, it&#39;s fine if you just flat out refuse him...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> No. On the battlefield, it&#39;s just an unavoidable instinct for warriors to seek proof that they have lived.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Assaulting helpless nurses is one thing. But, if I am the one nominated, that&#39;s a different story.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh\u2013!? S-So, that means!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You&#39;re going to give him the okay!?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Yes. I will respectfully counter his attack.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> After all, I am currently a nurse who possesses combat skills.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, so that&#39;s what you meant!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Hah hah hah hah! In other words, you mean if I win the battle, I can have you!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Fine by me, I&#39;ll take you on! Master, this will be a decisive battle... Let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Yes, victory is mine!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> By the way my beautiful lady, is it my imagination, or were all your attacks concentrated solely on me?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> No, you&#39;re not imagining things. ...Be that as it may, I will admit defeat.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Do as you wish, Fujimaru. My body is yours.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Don&#39;t you mean mine!?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> ?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> The winner is not the Servant, but the Master who commanded them, is it not?</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> That logic is so sound I don&#39;t know what to say!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> N-Now wait just a minute!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Y-Yes! It&#39;s not like Master fought with such an idea in mind!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Isn&#39;t that right, Master? ISN&#39;T. THAT. RIGHT?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;m sorry, some other time!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Exactly! Senpai is on a mission to save the world.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Getting sidetracked is, well...all sorts of danger, I think!</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> I can&#39;t believe this... You&#39;re the winner, yet you don&#39;t want your prize.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Well then, until next we meet. Goodbye, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Whew... That was close.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Well, if you asked me what was so close, I wouldn&#39;t know the answer myself...</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Hmm, so my last chance also ended in failure after all. I can&#39;t help but feel my self-confidence dwindling.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ah, um... Er, well. Whatever the reason, I think your straightforward courtship is wonderful.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Please don&#39;t be discouraged, and keep trying.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Miss Mash. If you&#39;d like, after this\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, that would be a no, thank you.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong> Rejected...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Guru Fergus...</p>',156),a=[n];function g(i,h){return o(),s("div",null,a)}var u=t(r,[["render",g],["__file","Fergus mac R\xF3ich.html.vue"]]);export{u as default};
