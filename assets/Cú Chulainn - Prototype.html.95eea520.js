Say, how was your sleep?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Where are we?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Wait, where&#39;s Mash?</p><hr><p><strong>Proto C\xFA:</strong> Let&#39;s see, this is a place in the middle of nowhere. Oh, the Missy isn&#39;t here.</p><p><strong>Proto C\xFA:</strong> Just you and me. My bad, for forcing you into this.</p><p><strong>Proto C\xFA:</strong> The Doctor&#39;s voice doesn&#39;t reach here. That little creature isn&#39;t here, either.</p><p><strong>Proto C\xFA:</strong> Why? Well, that&#39;s simple.</p><p><strong>Proto C\xFA:</strong> This is\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> In a dream?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> In my consciousness?</p><hr><p><strong>Proto C\xFA:</strong> You can call it a dream, or perhaps somewhere deeper than consciousness and unconsciousness?</p><p><strong>Proto C\xFA:</strong> I&#39;m not clear on the details, it occasionally happens to Servants and Masters.</p><p><strong>Proto C\xFA:</strong> A shared dream. Put it simply, we can see each other&#39;s memories\u2013</p><p><strong>Proto C\xFA:</strong> That&#39;s why we can both exist here like this, even though it&#39;s &quot;my dream.&quot;</p><p><strong>Proto C\xFA:</strong> That&#39;s right. This is my dream. My memories. My battlefield.</p><p><strong>Proto C\xFA:</strong> It looks like the one you saw before? Yeah, I suppose it does from your point of view.</p><p><strong>Proto C\xFA:</strong> It&#39;s linked to the most similar sight you&#39;ve seen recently, I think.</p><p><strong>Proto C\xFA:</strong> Look, here they come. To me, they look like the armies of Connacht\u2013</p><p><strong>Proto C\xFA:</strong> But who knows what they look like to you. Hey, snap out of it, it&#39;s gonna be a fight.</p><p><strong>Proto C\xFA:</strong> Try to keep up with your commands! If you can summon other Heroic Spirits, then do it!</p><p><strong>Proto C\xFA:</strong> \u2013Let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Proto C\xFA:</strong> Hahaha! Yes, that&#39;s the way!</p><p><strong>Proto C\xFA:</strong> Mow down that horde of enemies! Stab them, slash them, hack them, there&#39;s no end to them!</p><p><strong>Proto C\xFA:</strong> Just like the incoming waves. An endless battle on an endless battlefield!</p><p><strong>Proto C\xFA:</strong> Sure brought up some nice memories, didn&#39;t it? Hahaha!</p><p><strong>Proto C\xFA:</strong> Come on, Master! If we lose, we die. Well, not that I&#39;m sure about that\u2013</p><p><strong>Proto C\xFA:</strong> But fight like it is! Now then, more are coming!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Proto C\xFA:</strong> ...I guess this is it?</p><p><strong>Proto C\xFA:</strong> Just as I&#39;m getting into it, it&#39;s over. Hardly worth the effort.</p><p><strong>Proto C\xFA:</strong> How about you? Still ready for more?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m a little tired.</p><p><strong>Proto C\xFA:</strong> Haha! You&#39;re honest!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I can keep going.</p><p><strong>Proto C\xFA:</strong> Sure you&#39;re not overdoing it? Well, not that I can help you.</p><hr><p><strong>Proto C\xFA:</strong> Oh\u2013</p><p><strong>Proto C\xFA:</strong> Well well, this is a good dream! So saving the best one for last, huh?</p><p><strong>Proto C\xFA:</strong> Besides, talk about being unfair. That one over there is using &quot;the spear of the real me&quot; from the start.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn?:</strong> That&#39;s unfortunate. Why are you fighting with a hastily-made spear?</p><p><strong>Proto C\xFA:</strong> I got my reasons. I guess it reminds me of my last summon.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn?:</strong> The answer&#39;s obvious, but I&#39;ll ask anyway. You want me to go easy on you?</p><p><strong>Proto C\xFA:</strong> You&#39;ve got to be kidding.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn?:</strong> Ah, just as I&#39;d hoped. Impressive, C\xFA Chulainn, hero of Ulster.</p><p><strong>Proto C\xFA:</strong> What are you talking about? Well, Mr. &quot;C\xFA Chulainn&quot; of Ulster?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Two C\xFA Chulainn?</p><hr><p><strong>Proto C\xFA:</strong> Well, I guess it&#39;s possible. Meeting yourself in a dream. You get that, don&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn?:</strong> Nice, that&#39;s really a good way to put it. Well, shall we do this\u2013</p><p><strong>Proto C\xFA:</strong> Sure! Let&#39;s go, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Proto C\xFA:</strong> ...So it&#39;s a draw.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn?:</strong> With our Noble Phantasms, it&#39;s a miracle we didn&#39;t both bite the dust.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn?:</strong> I&#39;m impressed. My younger self is quite a tough guy.</p><p><strong>Proto C\xFA:</strong> My older self isn&#39;t too bad either. I&#39;ll finish you off next time.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn?:</strong> What? That&#39;s my line.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So uh, what&#39;s going on?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What do you mean?</p><hr><p><strong>Proto C\xFA:</strong> Uh... Well, basically, you see.</p><p><strong>Proto C\xFA:</strong> My skills have improved within the dream. When you wake up, I&#39;m sure it will be of use.</p><p><strong>Proto C\xFA:</strong> See you, Master.
