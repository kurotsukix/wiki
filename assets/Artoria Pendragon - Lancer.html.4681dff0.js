So the Holy City you saw was the avatar of my sacred lance.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> It is true there was a possibility that it could cause that. As you can see, I am rather lacking in humanity.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Lacking in humanity, huh... Now that you mention it, it&#39;s true that you feel a lot closer to the King Arthur we ran into in Fuyuki.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> So are you saying that if you&#39;re displeased with Fujimaru, then you&#39;ll also become like the Lion King?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> That you&#39;ll collect pure and noble humans, and use your sacred lance to imprison them?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> That&#39;s...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Hi there!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Roman and Altria?</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Hey there, Fujimaru. Good morning. Need something from the Command Room?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> ...I&#39;ll be leaving.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Foou...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Hmm. She left without saying a word to you after she saw you, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Well, after what happened in Camelot, I understand she feels awkward...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> So I guess it&#39;s not going well then, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> She won&#39;t really talk to me about it...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> She took off her helmet, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I see. She often comes to me to ask for advice, but she might not want to show her summoner any weakness.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Well, time heals all. She may have the same Spirit Origin as the Lion King, but the two of them are separate Heroic Spirits.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Given the chance, I think she&#39;ll open up to you in an instant.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I hope so...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> The chance? The chance, huh?</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Anyway, I&#39;m going to lay down for a bit...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> The chance... chance...</p><hr><p><strong>Merlin:</strong> Good night! Welcome to Merlin&#39;s dream world!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong> What&#39;s this... REM sleep? That&#39;s not good! Did you go back to sleep after the alarm went off? Or are you taking a nap?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong> At any rate, I would suggest you get some deeper sleep. I wouldn&#39;t be able to bug you until you do!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> No doubt... This is a nightmare!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> There he is, the root of all evil!</p><hr><p><strong>Merlin:</strong> I see. You&#39;re asleep, but your judgment is still sound. This is why I hate REM sleep, where the brain&#39;s half awake.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong> Well, I&#39;m just kind of an observer here, but I&#39;d still like you to welcome me.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong> Why, you ask? Well, you&#39;re worried about Altria, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong> Well, that&#39;s where I come in, you see. Just leave it to me!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong> Altria&#39;s always been rather stubborn. But when she has her sacred lance, she can become a handful. Heh.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong> Geez, I wonder who would give anyone something so dangerous... I feel bad for that fool.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, foooou! (It&#39;s you, you nightmarish idiot!)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Fou!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I can understand what Fou is saying!?</p><hr><p><strong>Merlin:</strong> Of course you can understand. We&#39;re in a dream here.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong> To be honest, I&#39;d never expect Cath Pa... I mean Fou to be this close to you.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong> With Fou here, I can&#39;t feed you lies woven into truth. I wanted to tease you a bit more and have some fun, but...</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong> Oh well, let&#39;s get down to business, then. You want to know what Altria is like when she&#39;s holding the sacred lance, right?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong> I&#39;ll lend you a hand, then. Fortunately, it seems like a channel is about to open.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong> To be honest, I can enter anyone&#39;s sleep.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong> During REM sleep, like yourself right now, the owner of the dream can \u201Cnotice\u201D I&#39;m there, so I don&#39;t want to enter that much.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou. Fou. Fou, fou, fo-fou!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> (That&#39;s right. This idiot here gets all powerless when he&#39;s being noticed in a dream. You can crush him like the bug he is right now.)</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong> Hey, don&#39;t just go telling someone the secrets of an incubus! Besides, that&#39;s only when someone&#39;s in REM sleep!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong> Anyway, I&#39;m going to have you enter non-REM sleep. Take a whiff of my special magical chloroform.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong> Very good. Now your mind will leave your body and soul, and move to the world of a certain Heroic Spirit&#39;s mind.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong> A flaxen-haired, green-eyed beauty. A shining lance. An isolated king. This is the Heroic Spirit you will meet.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong> You can talk to them all you want there. Anyway, I&#39;ll be leaving now, so don&#39;t worry about me.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong> When you wake up, you will be a certified Altria expert!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Foooou!? (This scumbag here is just gonna do whatever he wants and run again!?)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Ouch...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Where am I?</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong> So you&#39;ve finally awoken, my contractor. Such a sinful human for making me wait.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> But I do understand. You are wondering about the true feelings of your contracted Servants...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> You wish to touch the shining inner mysteries of my spirit, shrouded in Mystics...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> It is only natural to wish so... It is inevitable. No, a forbidden act dictated by fate!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I shall allow it, you perverse voyeuristic spirit! I shall reveal my ever-so-charming true self here and now!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I am none other than the true wielder of the shining lance! The blond, green-eyed king! Yes!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> Fionn mac Cumhaill is here, now! Now how about we shine!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;re the one shining!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> Of course. I am Erin&#39;s protector; naturally I sparkle. Well, I can dodge but I don&#39;t get invincibility.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> So bright. I don&#39;t want to see any of it!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> Hahaha, enough with the jokes.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> I am not a certain beguiling Lancer! You should have no reason to avert your eyes from my beauty!</p><hr><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> Anyway, let&#39;s set the jokes aside. I apologize, I got excited and wanted to have some fun.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> I am here because I sensed the presence of evil. My pure-hearted Master is about to fall in the trap of an evil incubus!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> I chased after that presence the moment I felt it. Come, take my hand.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> This kind of evil... No, perhaps not evil... Actually rather beautiful... I mean, what is this place?</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> It feels quite similar to my homeland... But I have no memories of a city being built with this kind of construction technology...</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> T\xEDr na n\xD3g? Hahaha. No, it can&#39;t be. It&#39;s a bit too flashy and showy for the Land of the Young...</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> Look out! Who are you!? Show yourself! You can&#39;t stop me from hugging [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her}!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> That should be my line. That human is my contractor. Keep your hands off.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> Well well, if it isn&#39;t the wielder of the sacred lance, the King of Knights! I see, so you are the one dwelling in this evil city.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> Hmm... This isn&#39;t good. This is really not good. Can I excuse myself to bite my thumb for a second?</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> I can figure out the layout of this place and explain it to Fujimaru once my wisdom swells.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> ...There&#39;s no need for that. When the time comes, I will speak with my own words.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Now, hold your lance and not your thumb, Fionn mac Cumhaill. The price you pay for trampling into my world is quite high.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> Hahaha. So that&#39;s how it&#39;s going to be, after all, huh? I knew that was going to happen without biting!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> I&#39;d be mad too if someone trampled the memories of my homeland. This fight is unavoidable.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> But before that, I think I&#39;ll confirm just one more thing. Fujimaru, do you want to leave with me?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Well, I just got here...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...I&#39;ll stay here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> I can&#39;t believe you&#39;d turn me down! What a faithful Master!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> But that&#39;s something to be happy and proud of. I guess any annoyances should take their leave.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> But it seems I have to pay the price first. Isn&#39;t that right, knight of the sacred lance?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Do not make me say it again. You talk far too much.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> Or maybe you&#39;re just being too uptight? Don&#39;t you have anything to say to the Master that you chose?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Of course my Master is going to choose my lance! There&#39;s no need to say that out loud!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> ...Now reroute your magical energy to me, Master! I will show you who is the better Lancer!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> Very well! Then I shall face you with my full strength!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> Needless to say, I&#39;m summoning some Celt soldiers, too. That&#39;s what the full strength of a king is, okay?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> Ughhhh!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Stand down, guardian of Erin! With respect to your exploits, I shall permit your retreat just this once!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> Oh, how very kind of you! You seem to possess a semblance of sanity after all!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> It&#39;s true that I&#39;m just getting in the way! Farewell then! Goodbye, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> ...Well then, Master. Why do you come to a place like this?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> This is the world of my memories. Have you too come to expose my identity?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s not my intent.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It&#39;s all Merlin&#39;s doing.</p><hr><p><strong>Altria:</strong> ...Merlin? Oh...I see. So that&#39;s how it is...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> But you bear some responsibility as well. You fell prey too easily to Merlin&#39;s cajolery.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> If we had not formed a contract, you would already be dead. Exercise more caution in the future.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> I differ from other Servants. It is not necessary for you to understand me.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> You only need to give me orders to fight. Everything else is inconsequential. Especially \u201Cmutual understanding.\u201D</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> ...Mutual understanding. Surely no such thing could exist between a human and me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Why is that?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Even though we&#39;re talking right now?</p><hr><p><strong>Altria:</strong> There is no reason. I am not the King Arthur you know.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> By bearing the sacred lance for too long, I became a Heroic Spirit with a Heaven attribute, rather than one of Humans or Earth.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> ...From your perspective, my vantage point is commensurate with a god&#39;s.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> So...I myself can no longer understand what is human warmth or laughter.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> What I consider \u201Cgood\u201D and what you consider \u201Cgood\u201D are surely different.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> I...am arrogant as I am merciless. You no doubt noticed during the last battle.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> I punish what I cannot forgive. I obtain what is valuable through force.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> I have not a shadow of a doubt that my way is just. I suppose you could say I am a tyrant.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Thus...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> If I were to enter your circle, I would trample the flowers of your human joy.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> My former self would have been loath to do such a thing.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Perhaps I no longer understand such feelings, but I do not want to ruin the joy of others.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Aren&#39;t you overthinking things?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> No. This is the truth, pure and unvarnished.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> What lies beyond is the Lion King you all have fought.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> So I guess we fought a Lion Queen, not a Lion King...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> What? Ah, I suppose a female king is in fact a \u201Cqueen\u201D...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> I just don&#39;t like the sound of it. Am I uneasy because that hits a little too close to home...?</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong> ...The vantage point of a god. I see. Such is the anguish of someone with power.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> God neither saves nor forgives people.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> God is the law, the nation, the world. Such an order collapses in the presence of human warmth.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Another trespasser...!? Who are you? Reveal yourself!</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> One who became a divine Heroic Spirit at the end of your path for protection. Do not fear, do not fear...</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> My name is Romulus. Like you, I was worshipped as a god while I continued to walk the earth.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> The shining emperor. The noble lance. The great tree soaring into the heavens. That is me, this is Rome!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Romulus, the Holy Progenitor!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> He&#39;s glimmering!?</p><hr><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> Indeed, good words. Fit for worshipping a god. Thus...</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong><span style="font-size:25px;">\u2014Die!</span></p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> \u2014You blocked Rome&#39;s spear. You resist the will of Rome.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Th-That was close...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Thanks, Altria!</p><hr><p><strong>Altria:</strong> What are you doing! Is this how they do things in Rome?</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> You&#39;re not aware? A rightful person cannot endure the light of the sacred lance.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> Perhaps you require an evil Master. One day, that person will go blind, heart gone cold, and become a mindless puppet who worships you.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> You have no need for voices with a heart. Nor do you have need for a heart.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> Deus Ex Machina. Goddess of the Sacred Lance. Return to your proper form.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> That is why Rome journeyed forth. To eliminate Fujimaru, your Master.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Mind your own business, Founder Romulus! I show no mercy to those who try to lay a hand on my Master!</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> What nonsense! The Lance from the Ends of the World stands no chance against the Spear of the Founder!</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> Come, my children, my infinite branches and leaves! Show Rome your heroic selves!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Ugh... How can Rhongomyniad be inferior? Impossible... Yet the truth is that I cannot break through!</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> Don&#39;t you understand, King of the Sacred Lance? You are not drawing out the sacred lance&#39;s full potential.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> Or should I say you were not intoxicated by it. You fought to protect your Master.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> However, it was not a fight to protect the world. Naturally, your lance would lose its radiance.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> What...! My lance remains! It is as radiant as ever!</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> ...You leave me no choice. I did not want to resort to action that&#39;s Un-Roman.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> However, sometimes violence is necessary. And that is now, Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...He&#39;s coming!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> A frontal assault to finish us off...?</p><hr><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> I ask of you, Fujimaru. Say you love Altria Pendragon!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Whaaaaaat!?</p><hr><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Wh-What are you saying, you cur! So barbaric, is that how Romans fight!?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Ignore him, Fujimaru, just keep channeling magical energy to me!</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> All appeals from the peanut gallery are rejected! Fujimaru, say, \u201CI love her!\u201D</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Just how long do you intend to make a fool out of me!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Of course I love herrrrr!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I! LOVE! HER!</p><hr><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Whaaaaaat! Um... Right... Thank you!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> No! Wait, I mean, wait! I do not require respect from my contractor!</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> Well, what if [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she} said the opposite? What if [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she} shouted, \u201CI hate you!\u201D?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> I would be extremely sad! Even I can get hurt sometimes!</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> Precisely. So your own words betray you, King of Knights!</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> You not only rejoice in your Master&#39;s love, you also hold your Master in esteem.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> ...Um, we just share the standard relationship of trust between Master and Servant...</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> That is fine. That is how it should be.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> Knight of the Sacred Lance. You are the child of a dragon, yet you are human, and strive to be human.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> Your soul still burns with passion. You possess a god&#39;s vantage point, but fall short of a god&#39;s heart.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> You failed to become a mechanical god. And that, precisely, is\u2014</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Rome, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> ...Indeed. Rome is adventure\u2014</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> The symbol for all that is human, graduating from the Age of Gods and gaining the heart to love fellow men as a human.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> ...I still do not possess... the heart...of a god...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;re the same Altria as always.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You&#39;re still the King Arthur of legend.</p><hr><p><strong>Altria:</strong> You think so? It&#39;s hard...for me to accept, but...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> ...But, if you, my Master, say so, perhaps it is true.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Hah hah. Being told something like that in such a loud voice would surprise anyone, of course.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Allow me to apologize. I said that you could not understand me.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> I will not retract that comment. It is an unshakeable fact that we are different.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> But... I may have been stubborn. There are times we may understand each other despite differing positions.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> With that, will you fear me, or rely on me? I shall see firsthand.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yeah. I&#39;m counting on you, Altria.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Yes. I look forward to our future time together, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I admit I&#39;m a little scared.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Y-Yes, that is true. I do not know...and it is not my fault, but...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> I heard the Lion King stormed through the Holy City, so I will try not to turn out like that...</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong> Bwahahahaha! King of Knights, you&#39;ve finally warmed up a bit!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I&#39;ve been waiting. I&#39;ve been waiting so long for this moment!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> This is the perfect chance! A Chance-sseum Tentyris!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Prepare yourself! You&#39;re not exactly my type, but I&#39;ve always wanted to make you bow before me!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> This voice...!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> ...I see. Not being able to take a hint was something this excruciating...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> I shall be careful myself, and not barge in when no one wants to see me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Doesn&#39;t this dream have too many guests!?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Yes, I agree. I shall make sure Merlin gets his just punishment someday.</p><hr><p><strong>??? &amp; ???:</strong> How dare you rub PDA in our faces and ignore us! There are two of us here! Who do you think we are!?</p><p><strong>??? &amp; ???:</strong> Bear witness to our earth-shattering alliance! We\u2014</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh &amp; Ozymandias:</strong> We are the first two kings of an ancient, golden age!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Gilgamesh and Ozymandias...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Yeah, be as heartless as you can and crush them.</p><hr><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Well then. Is there anything else on your mind?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Not particularly.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Gotta thank Romulus.</p><hr><p><strong>Altria:</strong> ...I wanted to speak more... about the sacred lance, and myself...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> But it seems we are out of time. Soon you shall awaken.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Well then, next time.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;ll visit you when I wake up.</p><hr><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Yes, let us go back, Master. Or should I say, \u201CLet us wake up.\u201D</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Until we meet again, my Fujimaru. In the meantime, I shall practice how to smile.</p>',295),a=[s];function i(h,g){return t(),e("div",null,a)}var l=o(n,[["render",i],["__file","Artoria Pendragon - Lancer.html.vue"]]);export{l as default};
