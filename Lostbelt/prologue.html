Section 1: Prologue/Dec 26th, 2019</h2><p>December 26, 2019. Fujimaru has completed [♂ his /♀ her] mission.</p><p>[♂ He /♀ She] repaired every Singularity,saving mankind from a dire existential threat.</p><p>The Rayshift system, which let [♂ him /♀ her] fight the destruction of Proper Human History, has been placed on lockdown as of this moment.</p><p>The Servants summoned to Chaldea have been released from their contracts, their tasks complete.</p><p>Save for Chaldea&#39;s acting director, Leonardo da Vinci, every Chaldean Servant is gone–vanished from the face of the earth.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...ou. Fou, fooou...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...My alarm...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...It&#39;s morning...</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fooou?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Morning, Fou.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, Fooou!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...Oh, right. So Christmas is over.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou. Fou...Fou.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Pardon the intrusion, Master Fujimaru...Oh, you&#39;re already awake.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Good morning, Senpai. You must have been exhausted after all that Christmas cleanup.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m glad Acting Director Da Vinci gave everyone today off, after we all went a little wild last night.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...It&#39;s hard to believe it&#39;s been a whole year since we completed the Grand Order and prevented the Incineration of Humanity.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yesterday may have been our last opportunity to eat with the staff we&#39;ve come to know so well...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But we shouldn&#39;t be too sad about that. They all have great jobs waiting for them at their next employers.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I was...also told that you&#39;ll first be going back to your family&#39;s home, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Do you, um, know what you&#39;ll be doing after that?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I got such a huge paycheck that I&#39;m totally at a loss.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh right, you finally got paid for all your hard work! As I recall, Da Vinci was grumbling about that...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> “I tried lowball it so it wouldn&#39;t look like I was playing favorites, but no matter how you run the numbers, this is what [♂ he&#39;s /♀ she&#39;s] earned. ”</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> “Still, I can&#39;t help but wonder if [♂ he&#39;s /♀ she&#39;s] really up to handling all this money at such a young age. ”</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> “Oh well, I suppose I can always hold on to it for [♂ him /♀ her] if push comes to shove! Much better than letting King David get his hands on it! ”</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, Fooou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Da Vinci said that last bit under her breath so quietly I could barely hear her. But she&#39;s right, of course; you earned every penny of it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So please feel free to use it however you like.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That said, if I might offer a suggestion, it would be to keep it in a savings account.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That way, you&#39;ll be able to handle any unforeseen expenses!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fooou.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...But I digress. So you don&#39;t yet know what you&#39;ll be doing next, huh, Senpai? As for me...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What about you, Mash? What will YOU be doing?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m going to stay at Chaldea for just a little while longer after everyone else leaves.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> All of our medical data may be safely backed up...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...but we still have to finish dismantling Chaldea&#39;s summoning system, so...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou. Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Fou!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What was that all about? He just ran off down the hallway all of a sudden...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;d better go look for him, to make sure he doesn&#39;t interfere with everyone else packing.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Please, you just relax, Senpai. I&#39;ll see you again tonight at the farewell party!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Well...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I guess I&#39;ll be saying goodbye to this room soon...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Maybe I&#39;ll take a walk around...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Maybe I&#39;ll go stop by the Command Room...</p><hr><p><strong>Chaldea Engineer:</strong> Did you hear the news? They say the inspectors for the inquiry board are already at the foot of the mountain.</p><p><strong>Chaldea Engineer:</strong> Apparently they&#39;ll be coming up here by helicopter once this blizzard dies down.</p><p><strong>Chaldea Engineer:</strong> Soon we&#39;ll have a new director appointed by the Mage&#39;s Association, along with fifty of their flunkies.</p><p><strong>Chaldea Engineer:</strong> Saying it&#39;s an investigation sanctioned by the UN sounds nice, but let&#39;s not kid ourselves about what this is. It&#39;s just a hostile takeover.</p><p><strong>Chaldea Engineer:</strong> All this time, the higher-ups at the Association have written off Chaldea as just another observatory...</p><p><strong>Chaldea Engineer:</strong> ...but the moment they see its value,they swoop in to milk it for all it&#39;s worth.</p><p><strong>Chaldea Engineer:</strong> ...Maybe it&#39;s weird for me to be upset about this, but I feel sorry for Olga Marie. She&#39;d never have wanted things to turn out this way.</p><p><strong>Command Room Staff:</strong> Well that&#39;s a surprise. You couldn&#39;t stand her back when she was alive.</p><p><strong>Chaldea Engineer:</strong> ...I mean, sure, I remember how she used to yell about anything and everything. Plus, she was...well, incompetent. Messed up all the time.</p><p><strong>Chaldea Engineer:</strong> ...But still, when I think back on it, I can&#39;t help but be impressed at how well she did despite all that...</p><p><strong>Chaldea Engineer:</strong> Honestly, we should&#39;ve been more considerate of her circumstances.</p><p><strong>Chaldea Engineer:</strong> Even if she WAS the daughter of a Lord family, she was still just a girl fresh out of school who&#39;d recently lost her father.</p><p><strong>Command Room Staff:</strong> I guess. But you just have to set that sort of thing aside when you take a position of power, right?</p><p><strong>Command Room Staff:</strong> As the heir to the Animuspheres, she should&#39;ve had that stuff completely covered, no matter what her age or how recent her dad&#39;s death was.</p><p><strong>Command Room Staff:</strong> To be brutally honest, she should never have taken over as director in the first place, but she clung to the authority it gave her anyway. And look where that got us.</p><p><strong>Command Room Staff:</strong> Chaldea was nearly obliterated, and we had to beg the Mage&#39;s Association for help to rebuild it.</p><p><strong>Command Room Staff:</strong> So it sucks, but if we want Chaldea to keep going, we have to let this new director take over.</p><p><strong>Command Room Staff:</strong> And if Olga Marie WAS still here, you can bet she&#39;d be the first in line to hand off the responsibility.</p><p><strong>Command Room Staff:</strong> Seeing as the alternative is having it shut down for good.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Hey there.</p><hr><p><strong>Chaldea Engineer:</strong> Hm? Oh, hey there, Candidate Fujimaru. Taking a walk around Chaldea?</p><p><strong>Chaldea Engineer:</strong> Enjoy it while you can. This is probably your last chance for a peaceful walk and fond memories here.</p><p><strong>Chaldea Engineer:</strong> Once the investigation gets going, there&#39;ll be scary security guards walking around like they own the place.</p><p><strong>Chaldea Engineer:</strong> You know, maybe I should take a page from your book and go for a walk myself.</p><p><strong>Chaldea Engineer:</strong> This might be the last chance I&#39;ll get to go wherever I want around here without a security pass.</p><p><strong>Command Room Staff:</strong> So you&#39;re staying here, Dustin? Oh, right,you were just an ordinary engineer, weren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Chaldea Engineer:</strong> Well excuse me for being ordinary. This is why I hate talking with you upstart mage jerks.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> An ordinary engineer...?</p><hr><p><strong>Chaldea Engineer:</strong> Sure. Not everyone who works for Chaldea is a mage.</p><p><strong>Chaldea Engineer:</strong> I used to study cosmic rays as a run-of-the-mill physicist before I came here.</p><p><strong>Chaldea Engineer:</strong> It was the last director, Marisbury, who offered me a job here. At the time, I was struggling just to get by.</p><p><strong>Chaldea Engineer:</strong> I&#39;m guessing he wanted me for my experience with particle accelerators. At first I thought he was full of shit...</p><p><strong>Chaldea Engineer:</strong> ...but eventually, his earnestness and passion won me over. Before I knew it, I found myself out here in the middle of nowhere.</p><p><strong>Chaldea Engineer:</strong> ...That was fifteen years ago. Far as I&#39;m concerned, this place is my home now.</p><p><strong>Command Room Staff:</strong> Is that so? I&#39;m headed to London, myself. One of the Clock Tower factions liked what they saw and made me an offer I couldn&#39;t refuse.</p><p><strong>Command Room Staff:</strong> But hey, if they start talking about making a new Chaldeas there, maybe I&#39;ll give you a call.</p><p><strong>Command Room Staff:</strong> We&#39;re not kids anymore, right? Nothing wrong with selling your hard-earned expertise to the highest bidder in this day and age.</p><p><strong>Chaldea Engineer:</strong> Hmph...That&#39;s just like you, Sylvia. You always were a real piece of work. But I appreciate your consideration, or at least as close as you can get.</p><p><strong>Chaldea Engineer:</strong> While you&#39;re here, Candidate Fujimaru...On second thought, let me just call you Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Chaldea Engineer:</strong> The inspectors are gonna have some questions for you, seeing as you&#39;re one of the Master candidates.</p><p><strong>Chaldea Engineer:</strong> And the Mage&#39;s Association people are about ten times more calculating and devious than Sylvia here.</p><p><strong>Chaldea Engineer:</strong> I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll be in any danger as long as Da Vinci&#39;s around, but watch out all the same.</p><p><strong>Chaldea Engineer:</strong> No matter how horrible they are to you,you can&#39;t lose your temper with them.</p><p><strong>Chaldea Engineer:</strong> Like they say, the only way to win is not to play. Just smile and nod, try not to let them get to you.</p><p><strong>Chaldea Engineer:</strong> Don&#39;t worry. Just play up the Goody Two-shoes act and they&#39;ll run out of nits to pick soon enough. You&#39;ll be out of there in no time.</p><p><strong>Command Room Staff:</strong> ...I agree with that. Besides, you didn&#39;t do anything wrong, Fujimaru. If push comes to shove, we&#39;ll vouch for that ourselves.</p><p><strong>Command Room Staff:</strong> Given the circumstances, you took the best course of action possible, and did everything you could.</p><p><strong>Command Room Staff:</strong> We can all attest to that. So don&#39;t be afraid to hold your head high and tell them:</p><p><strong>Command Room Staff:</strong> “Yeah, I&#39;m Fujimaru, Master of Chaldea and savior of humanity. What do you want? ”</p><p><strong>--SECTION BREAK--</strong></p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Well hey, if it isn&#39;t Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> How come you&#39;re not with Mash? This year&#39;s only got a few days left in it, you know.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> If I were you, I&#39;d want to make sure I had as many happy memories as possible together with her before I left.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I just wanted to say my last goodbye to you.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Well thanks for that. Too bad about that whole “last” part, though.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> None of your beeswax!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Whoa, those aren&#39;t for throwing, you know! And what are you so embarrassed about at this point, anyway!?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...But never mind that. I still have to finish writing this report.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Got some last-minute things I need to take care of before tomorrow, you see. Anyway, you&#39;ve got questions, right? Mind if I keep writing while I answer you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Fine with me.</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Great. No need to bother telling me what they are. Da Vinci knows what&#39;s up.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The new director who&#39;ll be here soon...The pending investigation...What&#39;s going to happen to Chaldea...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> So how about we review everything that&#39;s happened so far?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> In the year 2017, Chaldea detected an abnormality in Chaldeas, a simulation of the world as it&#39;ll be one hundred years in the future.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The light of civilization had gone missing from Chaldeas, which meant that it had observed the end of humanity.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> We hypothesized that the source of this abnormality lay in 2004, in the Japanese town of Fuyuki. We decided to send Team A, of which Mash was a member, there on an experimental Rayshift.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Unfortunately, the entire team was incapacitated in an act of sabotage, as were the other Masters on standby. That&#39;s Chaldea down forty-seven Masters in a single stroke.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But then there was you: Fujimaru, the forty-eighth Master. You were just a commoner selected to fill a quota, but you Rayshifted successfully.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> And so, as humanity&#39;s last Master, the mission of preventing mankind&#39;s extermination fell to you.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That began the Grand Order,our mission to restore humanity.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Chaldea went on to fix seven Singularities before finding the Final Singularity.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> There, they defeated the King of Mages, the one behind the Incineration of Humanity, and succeeded at repairing the foundations of human history.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That&#39;s right. You are the one who officially completed the Order, and who took back the world for mankind–the very world you&#39;re standing on right now.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But, your incredible, legendary adventure has come to an end, and it&#39;s time to return to reality.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Frankly, it&#39;s time to pass the torch.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> We&#39;ve lost eighty percent of our staff, and we simply can&#39;t continue operating as matters stand.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> So, we&#39;re getting an influx of new staff from the outside.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The formalities were finished about a month ago, and they just finished choosing the new staff last week.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Which means they&#39;ve now been discussing what to do about us for almost a year.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> This staff is practically knocking on our doorstep as we speak. In a few days, Chaldea will officially be under new management.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> A new Chaldea...</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That&#39;s right. We&#39;ll have a new director chosen by the Mage&#39;s Association itself, along with a staff he personally trained.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The new director is Goredolf Musik. He&#39;s the heir to a fairly well-known family in the magecraft world.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I&#39;m told he spent pretty much everything he had to snag Chaldea and all its benefits.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> He probably did that as a show of power, to let everyone know that Chaldea is now exclusively under Musik family control.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The proceedings are already underway, and it looks like most of our current staff are being let go.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But that&#39;s not the problem. You&#39;ll still be you,even if they kick you out of Chaldea for good.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The problem...is the UN inspectors who will be coming along with them.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Grand Order or not, there&#39;s no denying Chaldea broke a whole mess of regulations.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Changing personnel without clearing it with the Mage&#39;s Association...Disclosing highly classified information to low-level personnel...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Overusing Servant summons, which were supposed to be limited to up to seven Servants...Conducting Rayshifts without UN authorization...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> As far as they&#39;re concerned,these are all major crimes.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Even though we didn&#39;t do anything wrong?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Even though we were fighting to protect humanity?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Exactly! Not a single one of us did anything for our own personal benefit!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...Couldn&#39;t even if we wanted to, in fact, seeing as we were the only humans left in the entire world!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...But unfortunately,that meant less than nothing to them.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Sure, they could see what we were fighting against in the data.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The yearlong, global blank. The traces the Singularities left behind on Sheba.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Unbelievable as the Incineration of Humanity might be, the Association had to admit that it really did happen.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But for them, the data is just that, data. All they had to say in response was, “So what? ”</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> As far as they&#39;re concerned, the world ended while they were sleeping, and by the time they woke up, it was all back to normal.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The only thing they can see is the scores of dead,the valuable Master candidates who were injured...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...and the litany of rules Chaldea broke while this was going on.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> So this investigation is taking place to determine if these acts were deliberate.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> In the eyes of the Association, the staff of Chaldea is nothing more than a band of criminals.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Of course, that&#39;s why I&#39;m writing all these reports, to prove that this is all just a big misunderstanding.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Since data is all they&#39;ve got to work with,data is how we&#39;re going to cover our asses.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Once I prove that everything Chaldea did was in order to preserve humanity, not to betray it...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...my work here will finally be done.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Then the weight of everything he stuck me with will finally be off my shoulders. Including you, Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (...So that&#39;s why she&#39;s been sticking around...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...So what is this paperwork you&#39;re going to file?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Mostly our Servant usage records,and our Servants&#39; current conditions.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I know you don&#39;t think of them that way, but Servants are extremely powerful weapons, you know?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> So as far as the people outside are concerned, this is of critical importance, since it has to do with their own safety.</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Oh, and there&#39;s one more serious issue you should be aware of, especially since it concerns you directly.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The blast in the Command Room left all forty-seven of those Masters with horrific injuries.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> With them all near death, we cryogenically froze them in their Coffins. We&#39;ve been slowly thawing them all out, one by one, over the past year.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Now only the seven Team A Masters whose Coffins were still activating when the blast went off–again, the entire team, save for Mash–remain in cryostorage.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It&#39;s a good bit harder to thaw and revive them, you see, so we kept putting it off until they were in perfect condition.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But once this investigation gets underway, we should finally be able to revive them thanks to new staff who specialize in healing spells.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> And I&#39;m guessing that once that happens, some of these Team A Masters are going to take over as the new Masters of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The new director has been saying he won&#39;t need you anymore, and that you will be relieved of your position within the year...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...because he&#39;s already got his eye on other Masters he trusts from distinguished mage families.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Anyway, I know this is all a lot to deal with,but don&#39;t you worry. I&#39;ll take care of everything!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I haven&#39;t spent the last six months preparing for this day for nothing!</p><p><strong>G：Holmes:</strong> I believe you mean “we,” Leonardo da Vinci.</p><p><strong>G：Holmes:</strong> After all, I AM the one who did most of the work investigating the Association&#39;s movements, anonymizing the Spirit Origin graph, and dismissing the Servants.</p><p><strong>G：Holmes:</strong> Not that it was especially onerous for me, of course.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Holmes!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Huh...? Why are you...?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Ah yes, precisely the sort of reaction I was hoping for! That makes all the time I spent hiding in the shadows worthwhile!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> (Sigh)...Why did you have to let someone,even [♂ him /♀ her], know you were here, Holmes?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Sorry about that, Fujimaru. The fact that Holmes is here is the toppest of top secrets.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I have not so much as included his name in any of my reports to the Association.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> As far as they know, Sherlock Holmes was never among the Heroic Spirits summoned to Chaldea, and I mean to keep it that way.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I guess you could call this a kind of insurance policy, just in case everything goes south?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Insurance policy...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> South...?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Indeed. In the event that we face an enemy we cannot see...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> ...we will need an ally the enemy cannot see in turn. Hence our extreme caution.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Of course, I am no fighter. Should things turn violent,I won&#39;t hesitate to retreat to the workshop.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;re not a fighter...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What about your baritsu...?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Baritsu is strictly for self-defense. If armed assailants were to attack, I would only be able to protect myself.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Whoa, whoa, easy there. Things may get heated,but they&#39;re not gonna turn violent.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The main reason I had Holmes stay behind was to help with something I&#39;ve been working on.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You see, Holmes is an even more skilled scientist and mage than his stories let on.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> So I figured he would be the perfect choice to help me with a little something I&#39;ve been building.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Look at this. Just an ordinary briefcase, right? But its contents are more valuable than all the treasures in this world combined.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> We still haven&#39;t finished moving everything around, so I can&#39;t take it out just yet, but we should be done in another five days.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> If my calculations are correct, and they always are, it&#39;ll be done before we have to leave Chaldea. I&#39;ll tell you what it is then.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I most heartily concur. Now then, I think I shall return to the workshop.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> And don&#39;t worry!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> If a time should come when you are imprisoned, that is when I shall reveal my most secret technique!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> A secret technique...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> So, like, super baritsu...?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Oh come on, he was obviously talking about lockpicking. Any decent detective is an expert with lockpicks.</p><h2 id="section-2-prologue-dec-26th-2019" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-prologue-dec-26th-2019" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 2: Prologue/Dec 26th, 2019</h2><p>December 27, 2019</p><p>The blizzard has come and gone. Now all that remains is clear blue sky.</p><p>Before long, the pale blue is marked by the single black dot of an approaching helicopter. The helicopter brings important passengers, and the harsh reality that the end is close at hand.</p><p><strong>P. A. System</strong> ...Forty-four visitors cleared and registered.</p><p><strong>P. A. System</strong> All entrants are permitted to enter Chaldea by special exemption granted by the Association Board of Safety.</p><p><strong>P. A. System</strong> Opening front gate. Welcome, Goredolf Musik.</p><p><strong>P. A. System</strong> Welcome, UN inspectors. On behalf of Chaldea, we thank you for coming.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> So, this is it...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I wonder what this new director the Mage&#39;s Association chose is like...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Goredolf Musik. Male, twenty-eight years old. Heir to a wealthy family of alchemists.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> At the Clock Tower, where the Mage&#39;s Association is headquartered, he&#39;s considered to be...well, about average.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Much as the Musiks can boast a long familial history, within the world of magecraft, they have essentially accomplished nothing.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The only thing that sets them apart from the other mages is the extra bit of wealth they&#39;ve accumulated by virtue of existing longer.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Goredolf&#39;s basically just a rich brat from a well-off family. The question is, why did someone like that end up as Chaldea&#39;s new director?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I can&#39;t be certain until we meet him ourselves,but if I were to guess–</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Oho! Oho ho!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> This is great! Better than great!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I didn&#39;t have very high hopes for a lab out in the middle of nowhere, so you can imagine my surprise and delight to see how modern it all is!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> In fact, I think it might be even more advanced than the ones in London! What a bargain!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Speak of the devil. He&#39;s certainly got a boisterous voice.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Just remember, Fujimaru: silence is golden.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Trust me, this is the sort of person whose bad side you want to avoid even more than Olga Marie&#39;s. Piss him off, and you&#39;ll never hear the end of it.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Oho! And you must be the Servant I heard about in the report.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> You certainly do look the part. Let&#39;s see, Leonardo da Vinci, was it?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Not bad at all for a replica of a well-known genius. I always did prefer a beautiful woman for a familiar.</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong> Your Excellency, I believe that remark could be construed as sexual harassment♡ Remember, that Servant is, for all intents and purposes, the acting director.</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong> Though it amounts to little more than running a dinky factory out in the sticks, she HAS managed to keep Chaldea going in lieu of a proper director over the past year.</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong> It would be in your best interests to get on her good side. Why not lead with a compliment?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Hahaha! Koyanskaya, I thought I told you to whisper those sorts of things to me!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Besides, I have no intention of getting chummy with a Servant, no matter how beautiful she may be.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Why thank you. You&#39;re only the last person I&#39;d ever want to hear that from, but I&#39;ll take it as a compliment nonetheless.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Welcome to the Chaldea Security Organization, Director Musik. You must be tired after your long trip here.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Not at all. Aside from the month we lost due to waiting around for the blizzard to clear up, it was a most pleasant trip indeed.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Now then, without further ado...Er, Leonardo da Vinci, was it?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Just call me Da Vinci. Or Caster,if you find even that too much to remember.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> ...Very well. Caster should more than suffice.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> I am told that you have been filling in after Director Olga Marie Animusphere and Acting Director Romani Archaman suffered some...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> ...unfortunate accidents that led to them being unable to perform their duties.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Your hard work is appreciated, but no longer required. As of now, I am assuming sole command of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> What&#39;s more...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Much as I hate to do so, I will be taking all of you into custody. Immediately.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> (Easy there, Mash, Fujimaru. Just play it nice and cool. )</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> My, my. What an unpleasant surprise. Custody, you say? Did I hear you right?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I&#39;m afraid you have no grounds to do so. Not until this investigation is over, at least.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Have the powers that be already ruled that Chaldea is no more than a criminal cartel, and you have simply neglected to inform us?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Because I am quite sure that if that were the case, you would have come with more in the way of soldiers.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> We ARE the mysterious organization that saved the whole world, after all. If there was a warrant out for our arrest, you would have come with a small army at the very least.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But you only brought a paltry forty soldiers. Doesn&#39;t seem to fit the task, does it?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> So this isn&#39;t something the Mage&#39;s Association decided, but a call you made on your own, right?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Why don&#39;t we get the Association on the phone and see what they have to say about this?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Or would you prefer I didn&#39;t do that?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Grrr...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> ...What&#39;s the meaning of this, Koyanskaya!? That Servant is too smart for her own good.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Didn&#39;t you tell me the only people left at Chaldea were a bunch of engineers and a Master who was still wet behind the ears?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> I thought there wasn&#39;t supposed to be anyone here who would disobey me!</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Yes, Your Excellency, that was my understanding when I introduced this property to you.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> But my report must have been in error! Sorry about that♡</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> I&#39;m afraid that Servant is a reprehensible villain who doesn&#39;t know her place, and thinks she doesn&#39;t have to listen to those of us with the Mage&#39;s Association...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Wait a moment, Koyanskaya. Wouldn&#39;t a familiar who doesn&#39;t obey a mage be somewhat, er, dangerous?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Come now, Your Excellency, that won&#39;t do. You need to be aggressive! Show these people who&#39;s boss!</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Don&#39;t worry. We at NFF Services specialize in just these sorts of unlikely situations.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Even if worse comes to worst,we won&#39;t let them lay a finger on you.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Of course, that IS a special additional service,so it won&#39;t come cheap♡</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> What&#39;s this!? Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re trying to shake me down yet again, Koyanskaya!?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Your Excellency.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Y-yes, I know. Don&#39;t worry,I&#39;m a man of action when I need to be.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> ...Ahem. You&#39;ve got quite a mouth on you, don&#39;t you, Leonardo?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Just to be clear, this is far from the only personnel I brought with me from the Association.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Our helicopter will be back and forth, ferrying many personnel over who are still on the boat. All told, there are about a hundred and twenty security guards who have yet to arrive.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> It would be all too easy to take over Chaldea with force, and I assure you, that is a decision the Mage&#39;s Association would back wholeheartedly.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> We would be well within our rights to consider the entire current staff criminals...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> ...and to haul them all up and lock them away while we investigate Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Having said that, I would prefer to avoid violence,should that be possible.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Most of you will be fired regardless,but I would prefer we part on amicable terms.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> As such, I will have the four of you kept in a single room.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> You will wait there until the inquiry board summons you for your individual hearings.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> During that time, we will proceed with our inquiry into Chaldea&#39;s activities while we begin to transition over to the new staff.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> How does that sound? I believe this is the most peaceful option on the table.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> I daresay you wouldn&#39;t get such a generous offer from another member of a wealthy mage family...like those blinded by their Pride and Brand ranks.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> They may think of those like you with no talent for magecraft as little more than slaves, but not me.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> And above all, I&#39;d like to spare myself the tedium of torturing you for every little piece of information. I prefer to let Koyanskaya handle all that.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Wahaha, you should be grateful that I&#39;m such a gentleman! Just do as I say, and you&#39;ll be released soon enough!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I see. The Mage&#39;s Association certainly sent us quite a piece of work, didn&#39;t they?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Thank you for that breathtaking display of chivalry, Director Musik. Now, may I ask you something?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I&#39;d like to know why you bought up the rights to Chaldea. Surely a little research lab out in the middle of nowhere can&#39;t have much of interest?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Not much of interest? Haha, I&#39;ll be the judge of that.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> True, Chaldea doesn&#39;t enjoy the best reputation at the Clock Tower. I can&#39;t count how many times I&#39;ve heard them say things like...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> “Their magecraft theories are nonsense,” and, “They&#39;re just a bunch of incompetent frauds,” or, “They&#39;re a disgrace to the Twelve Lords”...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> To hear them talk, you&#39;d think they were discussing a problem child they wished had never been born.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> But not me. I believe there&#39;s tremendous value to be found here. Chaldea shows real promise!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> ...Or, at least it will once I&#39;M instated as director!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> At any rate, when I learned that Chaldea was being broken up into seven parts and auctioned off, I made my decision and took action.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> I used the entirety of the Musik family fortune to buy all Chaldea&#39;s assets and prevent its dismantling.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> You see, the Clock Tower people were desperate to get their hands on technology they could bring back to their respective departments.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> But I just DETEST them. I couldn&#39;t stand to see them get what they want.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> An organization needs all of its parts, just like a human body. It&#39;s barbaric to try and carve out its heart, or lop off one of its arms.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> I wanted Chaldea in its natural, untarnished state. And now, I have it.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> But I suppose there&#39;s an exception to every rule. The staff of an organization may be its lifeblood, but we won&#39;t be keeping THEM around! Bwahahaha!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> (...There you go, Fujimaru. As you can see, he&#39;s hardly the most formidable opponent we&#39;ve ever faced. )</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I believe that is more than enough in the way of pleasantries, Director Musik.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> You are the future of Chaldea, and they are the past. There is no need for you to reach any sort of understanding with them, nor for them to like you.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> More importantly, now that the Church is ready to investigate, I would like to begin as soon as possible.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Hmm, indeed. You make an excellent point, Father Kotomine.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Oh yes, allow me to introduce you. This is–</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong> Pleased to make your acquaintance. My name is Kotomine Kirei.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong> I&#39;m a priest sent here to investigate on behalf of the Holy Church. I will be staying here for a few days until the investigation is concluded.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong> It&#39;s a pleasure to meet the saviors of humanity, people of Chaldea. I may not be here long, but I hope we can help one another out during my stay.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I can&#39;t believe Chaldea&#39;s disciplinary room is now being used as a confinement cell...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You said it! If I&#39;d known we were going to end up stuck in here, I&#39;d have loosened up the purse strings when it came to its budget!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Just look at these rock-hard beds! This obsolete air conditioner! This cut-rate lighting!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It may as well have been a confinement cell all along! At least we&#39;re technically allowed to leave it if we want, but still!</p><p><strong>Chaldea Staff:</strong> Yeah...At least our bathroom is separate from the dining area...I don&#39;t care for the way that new director does business, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m glad we&#39;re all together.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Agreed. I&#39;d be lying if I said I didn&#39;t suspect some ulterior motive in rounding us up like this, but it&#39;s definitely better than keeping us apart.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;m glad they didn&#39;t separate us, Mash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Me too. I&#39;m still processing being placed in custody like this, but as long as you&#39;re here, Senpai, I don&#39;t have to be afraid.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Still...Um, Acting Director Da Vinci? I think I have a handle on who Mr. Goredolf is now, but...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...those other two...Ms. Koyanskaya, and Father Kotomine...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You still don&#39;t know what their deal is, right? I haven&#39;t been able to get a read on them either.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I can tell they&#39;re not your everyday secretary and priest, but that&#39;s all I can tell. I can&#39;t get a read on their magecraft abilities, either.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> All I know about Father Kotomine is that he&#39;s from the Holy Church–another organization that&#39;s long butted heads with the Mage&#39;s Association.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> As their name suggests, the Holy Church is a mysterious organization based on a religion that has followers all around the globe.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> They see Mystics as something that&#39;s solely under their domain, and suffer neither magecraft nor heresy in the name of their Lord.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Their mission is more or less to bring all human knowledge under their control.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> They were a lot more aggressive about that back when I was alive, but nowadays they seem to be playing their cards much closer to their chest.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I&#39;m guessing that priest must be part of their combat team. Executors, I think they call them.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> They&#39;re supposed to be devotees of the blade who spread God&#39;s teachings in His absence. That&#39;s all you need to know about them.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> These Executors are both faithful and heretical...Monsters who fight the mages and mystical creatures.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> They may not be a match for Servants, but they are frighteningly powerful in a fight.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> True. I could tell that that priest is adept at hunting and fighting.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Or, at least, that&#39;s what Galahad is telling me.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> As for Koyanskaya...We know so little about her that it&#39;s almost comical.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> She isn&#39;t affiliated with either the Mage&#39;s Association or the Holy Church.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It looks like she was the one who may have convinced Goredolf to acquire Chaldea. Aside from that...</p><p><strong>Chaldea Staff:</strong> She did mention NFF Services. I&#39;ve heard of them before. They made headlines in Russia about six months ago.</p><p><strong>Chaldea Staff:</strong> They&#39;re a private military company...Mercenaries, basically. Word has it they&#39;re a group of specialists who never met a job they didn&#39;t like.</p><p><strong>Chaldea Staff:</strong> I think they go around billing themselves as “Global Kitschy Business Consultants. ”</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Russia, hmm...The Mage&#39;s Association doesn&#39;t have much sway there. So how did she and Goredolf come to know one another?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> No, wait. There were a number of academics among the new staff. They&#39;re all from NFF Services.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> In which case...they must plan on reviving Team A with the new staff alone...</p><p><strong>Chaldea Staff:</strong> What!? That&#39;s insane! Don&#39;t they know how much constant attention and adjusting the Coffins require during the unthawing process!?</p><p><strong>Chaldea Staff:</strong> We&#39;ve done it more than anyone, and it still has a huge chance of failure, even for us! There&#39;s no way people who have never done it before can pull it off on their own!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yup. Pretty solid chance they&#39;ll fail, and Chaldea&#39;s seven A-ranked Masters will be lost for good.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...Of course, that may be the point.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Security Guard:</strong> Fujimaru! Get out here! The inspectors want to talk to you!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Well now, looks like they&#39;re not wasting any time getting the interrogation party started. I&#39;m surprised they&#39;d kick things off with you, though.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Wait and see what their game is. Remember, silence is golden. Try not to say anything more than is absolutely necessary.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Got it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (...Not like I actually know anything...)</p><hr><p><strong>Security Guard:</strong> Good. The case inspector is waiting for you in Room 3.</p><p><strong>Security Guard:</strong> Just answer his questions honestly and you&#39;ll be released in no time. Don&#39;t even think about trying to resist.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Ugh...Six hours...Endless questions...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (I had no idea what they were even talking about most of the time...)</p><hr><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> You look exhausted, little [♂ boy /♀ kitty].</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> This your first time playing with the big boys? Then you&#39;d better hurry up and learn how the game is played. As they say, experience is every–Aah!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fooou!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Kyu!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Fou!?</p><hr><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Oh, is this your cat? I&#39;m sorry, I couldn&#39;t help but hit back♡</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Kyuuu!</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Whoops! Clumsy me! Now I&#39;ve gone and stepped on it♡ But what can you do?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> This is how it goes when the weak attack the strong.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Maybe once upon a time this thing was more impressive, but now it&#39;s just a puny little hair ball.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> It&#39;s the way of the world that it finds itself under the heel of a stronger animal now, don&#39;t you think?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Stop it...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Get away from Fou!</p><hr><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Ooh, so wild. How brave of you to bare your fangs for your little pet. It&#39;s even cuter how they&#39;re barely more than nubs.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> But I can&#39;t just let it go. No, no. Not after it went after my perfect skin with its little claws.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Normally, I&#39;d break a leg or two so it knows not to mess with me again, but...</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> ...I might be willing to let it go unharmed,IF you agree to chat with me for a bit.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> So what do you say? Care to swap secrets with little old me?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Okay.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...I&#39;m trusting you to keep your word.</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Kyu, kyuuu!</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Now, now, settle down, little Fou. Your owner and I are just getting down to brass tacks, after all.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> All right. Now that we have an agreement,my dear Fujimaru, here&#39;s my first question:</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> How much do you know about Chaldea?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> I&#39;m told you were scouted in some random country and brought here directly...</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> ...but no matter how you slice it, you were born into a commoner&#39;s family. I bet you didn&#39;t even know the first thing about magecraft before you came here, did you?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> No, no. Don&#39;t answer. It&#39;s all over your face. Hmm...I see. So you had a strong aptitude for Rayshifting.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> I can&#39;t believe you came all this way on that alone. Do you even know where you are?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> They probably didn&#39;t even tell you which country Chaldea is located in, did they?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> All I know is we&#39;re on a very tall mountain...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...Now that you mention it...</p><hr><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> You&#39;re at the heart of one of the most secluded areas in the world, one not in the borders of any nation. An unobservable mountain that&#39;s been hidden behind a barrier of magecraft for hundreds of years.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Had Chaldea actually told you where you&#39;d be going when they recruited you, I doubt you&#39;d have ever signed up.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> I can practically see your protests, asking if they&#39;ve lost their mind, expecting you to go so far away.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Trust me, this place is as isolated as you can get. I could show you the six months&#39; worth of paperwork it took to buy this place to prove it.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> But, never mind that. It doesn&#39;t concern you, anyway.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> The thing I&#39;m dying to learn more about is the original forty-eight Masters.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Of those, nine are still here: Mash Kyrielight,the seven Team A masters in cryostorage, and you.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> The other thirty-nine have been revived and sent home.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> No doubt they went back to living their lives in peace, but the thing is, their personal information still goes for a very high price.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> And why wouldn&#39;t it? Now that it&#39;s been proven that Rayshifting is possible, each of those candidates is worth their weight in gold.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> But none of them are likely to fetch as high a price as Team A. They were the seven people who were originally meant to save the world, not you.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Oh, wait, that&#39;s not right, is it? Let me rephrase that.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> The seven people from whom you stole the opportunity of a lifetime.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fo...Fooou! Nnn, kyu kyuuu!</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Okay, that&#39;s enough out of you, my little footstool♡ Think you can kneel for me like a good little weakling before the plane comes in for a landing?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Now then, tell me: How much do you know about those seven people?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;ve never heard ANYTHING about them the whole time you&#39;ve been here?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> They&#39;re your great senpai, after all. I&#39;m pretty sure even Mash knows a thing or two about them.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> After all, they were training together to be Masters long before you even knew what Chaldea was.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> No way. You really have NO idea? Never mind their magecraft affinity; you don&#39;t even know their NAMES?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> You&#39;re kidding! I didn&#39;t know you were so coldhearted, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> In that case, you really can&#39;t blame them if they wake up pissed off at you, can you? After all...</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> ...you stole everything from them. Their jobs...their purpose...even their place at Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fooo...Fooou! Fo fooou!</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Oh my, that was close. Come now, little Fou, you shouldn&#39;t keep going after a lady&#39;s face.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Keep acting up like this, and I might just have to defend myself...Maybe by biting off your head. Then that would be it for you, and you wouldn&#39;t have any more chances to learn again, would you?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> ...Oh drat, look at the time. I&#39;m supposed to meet Sir Goredolf soon.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> So, on that note, I think I&#39;ll be on my way now♡No more wasting time on a know-nothing patsy.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Lucky for you you&#39;re so ignorant,isn&#39;t it, Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> If you knew anything at all about even one of the Team A Masters, I&#39;d be rushing you off to grill you about them in solitary for as long as it took...</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> ...but sadly, it looks like that honey-licious branch isn&#39;t available to us, sooo, byeee for now!</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> And be careful when a beautiful woman comes your way from now on! Trust me, you don&#39;t want to find yourself falling for the honey pot♡</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou...Fooou!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...She&#39;s gone...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...The Team A Masters...</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Welcome back, Senpai. I see you met up with Fou on the way.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> He&#39;s been hiding out for a while,so I&#39;m relieved to see him with you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Senpai? Is something wrong? Did the investigation go badly?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s not the investigation...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It&#39;s about Team A...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Team A?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Hm, now you mention it,I never did tell you about them, did I?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I didn&#39;t mean to keep it from you. We just never really had the time to discuss them...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That&#39;s true. Especially since the seven Team A Masters ended up not being at all involved in stopping the Incineration of Humanity.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But, now that they&#39;re about to be thawed out,and we have nothing better to do...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...this seems as good a time as any to tell you a little about them.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Team A refers to a group of A-ranked Masters handpicked by Chaldea. Mash was originally part of this team too.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> First up: Kirschtaria Wodime.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The chairman of the Animusphere-controlled Astromancy Department, one of the Clock Tower&#39;s twelve departments of study, and the official Team A leader.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> He&#39;s the head of the exceptionally distinguished Wodime family, whose name and magical circuits have both been around for thousands of years.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> He&#39;s also Marisbury&#39;s top pupil, and was rumored to be a better heir to the Lordship than Olga Marie.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> He was expected to forge a contract with a Lancer. In terms of overall magecraft capability, he was head and shoulders above the rest.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Ophelia Phamrsolone, the prodigy of the Evocation Department.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> She possessed special Mystic Eyes, so she wore an eyepatch that really made her stand out, even here.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> She was expected to forge a contract with a Saber, but she seemed to be very particular about what sort of Heroic Spirits she would contract with.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Kadoc Zemlupus. Nothing special as far as mages go,but his affinity for Rayshifting was exemplary.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> His story is pretty similar to yours, seeing as he was the only ordinary member among all the geniuses on Team A.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But his kindness more than made up for it, even if it did descend into self-deprecation at times.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, I remember. Kadoc was always concerned for others.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Though he also had a pessimistic side,which bothered him as much as anyone else.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> He was expected to form a contract with a Caster.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> He didn&#39;t have much magical energy, so he wanted to avoid a combat-oriented Servant who would guzzle up everything he had before the fight had even begun.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Next up, Scandinavia Peperoncino.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yes, you heard me. Scandinavia Peperoncino. Nobody knows his origins, and he&#39;s using a pseudonym, obviously.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> He was a freelance mage Marisbury recruited after they met abroad.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Cheerful and funny, he always had a joke ready that kept Team A&#39;s spirits high.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> He was also the oldest member of the team. You could say he was a man a bit ahead of his time.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> He was expected to form a contract with an Archer. He had an Italian air about him, but he was also strangely knowledgeable about Buddhism.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Naturally, he also knew a lot about Indian mythology. Said he liked myths about cycles of death and rebirth.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Akuta Hinako. She got her start in Yumina, the Botany Department, which is tied to the studies of witches at the Clock Tower.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> She used to be part of Chaldea&#39;s engineering team, before her latent talents were spotted and she was added to the pool of Master candidates.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> She was the kind of person who would have been happy doing nothing more than curling up with a good book from morning till night.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But she had a...strange aura about her that you couldn&#39;t help but notice.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Come to think of it, Romani used to sulk about how she&#39;d never come in for routine physicals.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> She was expected to form a contract with a Rider. That was really important to her, for some reason.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Next...Beryl Gut. As for him...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Eh, I guess we don&#39;t have to cover ALL these Masters in depth!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Moving on!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Last, but not least, we have...Ah, right. Daybit Sem Void.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> He was something of an enigma, really. A loose cannon, you could say. Even got himself banned from his department at the Mage&#39;s Association.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That would be the Folklore Department, or Brishsan, if you&#39;re wondering. They deal with otherworldly artifacts.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It&#39;s an unorthodox field of study despite being led by the Clock Tower&#39;s chancellor.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Anyway, Marisbury had the highest regard for Daybit&#39;s talent. I thought he was a rare find too.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> There&#39;s only one, maybe two other people I recognized as geniuses even when I was alive...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...and Daybit was right up there with them.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> He never tried to understand anyone else,and nobody else ever understood him.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> He was expected to form a contract with a Berserker, though no one ever expected him and his Servant to reach any sort of understanding.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> And that&#39;s every Master on Team A. Quite the cast of characters, right?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But don&#39;t let that get to you. If anything, they&#39;re the ones who would be timid around YOU now.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> They may have been your senpai a year ago, but now, you&#39;re the senpai, and you&#39;ve got the experience to prove it.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Team A is nothing if not a meritocracy. They respect people based on their accomplishments, and yours have been pretty incredible.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> In fact, if I were you, I wouldn&#39;t bank on getting any sleep for a week or so once they&#39;re awake. They&#39;ll be constantly bugging you to tell them all about your experiences in the Singularities.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Wodime has a great tea stash, as you&#39;d expect from a noble. Kadoc can be shy, but he&#39;s very studious, and is hugely into mythology.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Pepe was a great listener. Even Akuta, who usually never said much of anything, would open up in front of him.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Indeed. I have no doubt that half of Team A would get along great with you, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Which is exactly why I&#39;m concerned. Thawing them out will have a profound effect on Chaldea&#39;s future.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Goredolf is moving full steam ahead with the thaw, but it&#39;ll still take at least four days to get all the equipment ready.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I can only hope they finish investigating the current staff before they get started...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I agree. Our term lasts until the very end of the year.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So if the investigation concludes by the 31st,we should just be able to help thaw them out.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> The very end of the year...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Only four days to go...</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fooou!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Right. Whether you stay or go, this is still our problem to handle, at least for now.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> If something were to go down, it&#39;d definitely be on the last day of the year, the 31st.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> So let&#39;s just be patient, keep our guard up, and wait for the right opportunity. Sound good, Master of Chaldea?</p><h2 id="section-3-prologue-dec-31st-2019" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3-prologue-dec-31st-2019" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 3: Prologue/Dec 31st, 2019</h2><p>December 31, 2019 The once clear, blue sky is slowly obscured by ominous clouds.</p><p>This is the beginning of the end of 2019.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Da Vinci still isn&#39;t back...</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fooou...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I know, Fou. It&#39;s been twelve hours since Mr. Goredolf called for her last night.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s 4: 30 p. m. right now...That gives us less than eight hours until the year ends...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Pardon me.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong> Hello there, Fujimaru. Mr. Meunière. Ms. Demi-Servant.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong> I hope you don&#39;t mind my stopping by. I just wanted to chat with you again one last time.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Father...Kotomine?</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong> My name is of no great consequence. “Father” will be more than sufficient.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong> Very soon, your four-day house arrest will come to an end. The investigation will continue until tomorrow, but you have been cleared of suspicion.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong> It seems the Mage&#39;s Association wishes to have you arrested, but we at the Holy Church feel otherwise.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong> We see the battles you have fought and the contributions you have made, and recognize them for what they&#39;re worth.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong> My superior, Pontifex Noi,commended your accomplishments personally.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong> He also told me to keep you safe from the Mage&#39;s Association&#39;s concealment system, saying it was the least we could do for those to whom we owe our lives.</p><p><strong>Chaldea Staff:</strong> R-really...!? Then, does that mean we&#39;re fully acquitted?</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong> It does. I talked to Musik, and he agreed to release Chaldea&#39;s entire former staff from their confinement in just a few more hours.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So, we still can&#39;t leave just yet?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Wait.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> If we go free, what happens to Acting Director Da Vinci?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What about Da Vinci?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Right. The investigators called her in last night,and she still hasn&#39;t returned. Where is she?</p><hr><p><strong>Priest:</strong> Ah, Leonardo? She&#39;s a Servant, so we can&#39;t afford to release her.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong> We will unsummon her once she finishes helping us with our current task.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong> This world is meant for the living. It has no place for the lingering dead, like Heroic Spirits.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong> Even the saints are no exception. The remnants of days past have no place in today&#39;s world, no matter what they may be.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...So you don&#39;t think Servants are valuable? Are you telling us that only the Holy Church is on humanity&#39;s side, and that Mystics must be opposed in all their forms, no matter what?</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong> Not at all. Servants are useful tools. What I hate is the very concept of Heroic Spirits itself.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What&#39;s Da Vinci working on?</p><hr><p><strong>Priest:</strong> Leonardo has been hard at work in the Command Room as of last night. The procedure to unthaw Team A has already begun.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong> Now that the Coffins have been repaired, they were to be thawed by 4: 00 p. m. today, so I expect we&#39;ll be hearing word of their success any moment now.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong> Leonardo will be on her way once that is done, but I am willing to at least grant her a last supper.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong> By all means, enjoy your final meal together this evening.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong> Once you are done, I will have you taken to my helicopter and ensure you return to your family safely.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s for me to decide, not you.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong> Of course. If that is your decision, I will respect your wishes. Indeed, part of me expected you would say as much.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Frankly, I don&#39;t trust you.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong> Well that&#39;s a shame. Here we&#39;ve only just met, and you&#39;ve already decided you dislike me. Of course, if that&#39;s your decision, I will respect it.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong> You ARE the Master who prevented the Incineration of Humanity. Your instincts must be impeccable.</p><hr><p><strong>P. A. System</strong> Operation complete. Coffin thawing: successful.</p><p><strong>P. A. System</strong> The Coffins will be released in three minutes.</p><p><strong>P. A. System</strong> Father Kotomine, please report to the Command Room. We are about to begin the resuscitation procedure.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So the thawing was successful...Da Vinci must have pulled it off!</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong> Indeed. She is quite gifted.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong> Wish that I could overlook her secrets out of respect for her capabilities, but alas...</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong> At any rate, this brings us to the end,doesn&#39;t it, Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong> I truly admire your hard work, your restraint,and your patience. More&#39;s the pity...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...What do you mean?</p><hr><p><strong>Priest:</strong> Come now. You really don&#39;t know?</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong> All the miracles you performed are about to be destroyed at the hands of the very paragon of mediocrity.</p><p><strong>P. A. System</strong> Operation complete. Coffin thawing: successful.</p><p><strong>P. A. System</strong> The Coffins will be released in three minutes.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Fwahahaha! Well done, Da Vinci! I&#39;m impressed!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> We waste three days trying at this and nothing! You come in and get it done overnight!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Maybe I should reconsider getting rid of you. I would hate to lose such a talented engineer.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> In fact, I just received word that my own engineers are having trouble with Chaldea&#39;s generator. They seem to have no idea what to make of it.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> If you stayed on as my secretary, that little problem would go away as well. What do you say? I&#39;m quite generous to those who obey my commands.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Thanks, but if that&#39;s my only option, you can consider this my resignation. I&#39;m here only out of interest for Chaldea as it was.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I couldn&#39;t possibly care less about yours.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I&#39;ll be on my way as soon as I have dinner with the rest of the former Chaldea staff.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Hmph, so it&#39;s like that? Fine, then!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> You there, why aren&#39;t those Coffins open yet!? Hasn&#39;t it been three minutes by now!? How long are you going to make me wait!?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> I trust this goes without saying, but Wodime is our first priority! The crown jewel of the Clock Tower!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> We&#39;ll wake him up first and put him in my debt by telling him I saved his life!

That is the situation we find ourselves in.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Chaldea is under attack by an unknown military force. All exits have been sealed off, preventing any escape.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Goredolf&#39;s private soldiers are doing their best to fight the intruders off, but it won&#39;t be long now before our adversary claims victory.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Our task is quite simple. As we cannot escape outside, we will escape underground.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Our adversary has yet to occupy the underground hangar, so that is where we will go. There we will find a shipping container in which we can take shelter.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> As it happens, I rescued four other staff members along the way and instructed them to head to the hangar as well.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I would counsel alacrity. Move now, while the hallways are still empty of enemy soldiers.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Their attention appears to be directed towards the Command Room for the moment, but once they have seen to their business there, it won&#39;t be long before they find the underground facilities.</p><p><strong>Chaldea Staff:</strong> The hangar...Oh, you mean the dock we use to send cargo down the mountain! That WOULD work as a shelter!</p><p><strong>Chaldea Staff:</strong> This is great! We&#39;re saved! Come on, Mash, Fujimaru, what&#39;re we waiting for!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes...That is our best chance. But...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> We can&#39;t leave Da Vinci behind.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Go on without us, Meunière.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fou.</p><p><strong>Chaldea Staff:</strong> Are you kidding me!? Holmes JUST told you the Command Room is the most dangerous place here!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> ...I can see you&#39;ve steeled yourself for the dangers ahead. Good. A word of advice, then.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Go around to the Command Room by way of the L2 stairs. That will send you in the opposite direction of those black-garbed soldiers.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I expect you will find Ms. Da Vinci inside her workshop, but you will need to make your way through the Command Room regardless.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Once you have met up with her, come straight to the hangar. Regretfully, I will not be able to go with you.</p><p><strong>Chaldea Staff:</strong> Huh!? You&#39;re gonna let them go off on their own, Holmes!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s okay. Holmes has his own things he needs to take care of. Right, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m counting on you to rescue everyone else.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> A bit nerve-racking, but I&#39;ll be okay with Mash here.</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Precisely, [♂ Mr. /♀ Ms. ] Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Very well, I shall leave Da Vinci&#39;s rescue in your capable hands. Come, Mr. Meunière. I can accompany you to the hangar, at least partway.</p><p><strong>Chaldea Staff:</strong> J-just me...? But...Right...Figures...</p><p><strong>Chaldea Staff:</strong> Okay, Mash, Fujimaru. Sorry to run off ahead, but I&#39;ll see you two back at the hangar!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Okay! Be careful, Mr. Meunière! Thanks for doing this, Holmes!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Of course. Just make sure you both exercise caution as well.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fou!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fooou...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Good, we made it to the back of the Command Room without those soldiers spotting us...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Unfortunately, it looks like they&#39;ve taken control of it, just as Holmes said.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I don&#39;t see Da Vinci anywhere. If she escaped to her workshop, then–Wait, is that...?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fooou...!</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Ugh, don&#39;t tell me you STILL haven&#39;t found that graph? If it&#39;s not on the main server, it must be hidden somewhere else.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Remember, our primary mission may be to take control of Chaldea, but our secondary objective is to seize that data at any cost.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> You may be satisfied as long as you can keep killing, but I told you that data is more important, didn&#39;t I?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> ...I swear, this is what happens when you just go around slaughtering without a moment&#39;s thought.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Oprichniki are supposed to be the best of the best, but you guys are completely useless. You can&#39;t even capture a lone Servant.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Oh well, at least we gained control of the Command Room. You all, remain on standby.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> The Grand Duchess will be here any moment now. I trust you at least know how to welcome royalty properly?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s...Koyanskaya!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> So she&#39;s working with those soldiers...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...So it would seem. Although, she called them “Oprichniki”...Where have I heard that name before...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No, never mind that now. Saving Da Vinci comes first. Let&#39;s stay out of sight and make our way to the workshop, Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It doesn&#39;t look like the soldiers are going to leave the Command Room anytime soon...That is probably what&#39;s stopping Da Vinci from leaving.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hey there, Fujimaru! Thanks for stopping by!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I THOUGHT you might show up! I had no REASON to think that, but now I&#39;m glad I did!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Da Vinci! Thank goodness you&#39;re all right!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yup, I&#39;m doing okay. Things were looking pretty dicey for a while there, but I made it here intact.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Those things are awful, you know? No matter how many times you kill them, they just keep getting back up and swarming all over you.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Now I know how it feels to be a lump of sugar getting mobbed by ants. Or maybe a piece of meat getting attacked by piranhas? Something like that.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Anyway...So you went and transformed, Mash. Just when you had a chance to get your body back to normal, too.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Now we&#39;ll have to start your treatment all over again.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I&#39;m sorry. I know you&#39;ve all been so considerate of me...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Eh, don&#39;t worry about it. Can&#39;t really complain when Fujimaru and I are alive now thanks to that decision.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Now then, Fujimaru. I think we&#39;d better save the long-winded explanations until later.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I take it you ran into Holmes? He&#39;s still here, right? Then I don&#39;t have to waste my breath telling you that you need to escape to the hangar.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I was planning to head there myself once I&#39;d met up with you, but there&#39;s something I left behind.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> This is the one thing we can&#39;t let them get their hands on. It contains a copy of the graph made up of the data patterns for the Spirit Origins of all the Heroic Spirits you&#39;ve formed contracts with to date...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> In short, it contains your bonds with them.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> As long as you have this and Mash with you, you&#39;ll be able to summon Heroic Spirits again. Though you WILL need access to a good leyline and a ton of energy to activate it, of course.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Chaldea may not be able to get it up and running right now, but as long as we can make it through this predicament, we should be able to figure something out.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I bet this Spirit Origin graph is what they&#39;re looking for, too.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I originally moved it to this briefcase to keep it out of Goredolf&#39;s hands. Either way, good thing I did.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Anyway, now that you and Mash are here, Fujimaru, we can slip out through the Command Room.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Mash, I know that your body isn&#39;t operating at its peak, but do you think you can hang in there for just a few more battles?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Of course. It&#39;d be my honor to accompany you,Acting Director Da Vinci.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Great. Then I&#39;ll be counting on you two to back me up. We&#39;ll need to take out the soldiers in the hallway to make it to the hangar.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> We have no choice but to cut through the Command Room along the way, but I do NOT want to fight in there if we can possibly avoid it.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> As I&#39;m sure you saw for yourselves, something is attacking Chaldeas.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Ordinarily, Chaldeas should be protected by a powerful force field, making it impossible to touch. I&#39;m still not sure exactly what&#39;s going on, but it looks like they&#39;ve somehow managed to seal Chaldeas away.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> And that means there&#39;s a chance that Chaldeas could be physically destroyed. Even a single stray shot or ricochet could damage it.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> We have to avoid that at all costs. If Chaldeas ends up broken, fixing it would be impossible.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Got it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...Let&#39;s go!</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That&#39;s the spirit. This takes me back to our battle in the Holy Land.... You&#39;ve grown so much since then.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Really now, you didn&#39;t have to come back for me. You would&#39;ve been just fine even if I was gone. But, thanks for coming all the same.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Which isn&#39;t to say I couldn&#39;t take care of myself! Now let&#39;s get out of here and head to the hangar!</p><h2 id="section-6-prologue-dec-31st-2019" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-6-prologue-dec-31st-2019" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 6: Prologue/Dec 31st, 2019</h2><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> This is...the hangar!?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s right. This is where Chaldea stores various kinds of equipment, and disposes of materials it no longer needs...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But that huge shipping container didn&#39;t used to be here! What could it be...?</p><p><strong>Chaldea Staff:</strong> Fujimaru! Mash! Ms. Da Vinci!</p><p><strong>Chaldea Staff:</strong> I&#39;m so glad you all made it! Check it out! This is the container we&#39;re using as shelter!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I&#39;m well aware, Meunière! Good to know you guys are safe and sound too!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Let&#39;s go inside, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That container is made of a special, highly durable material. It&#39;d take a tank shell to even dent it.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> What&#39;s more, we set it up on some rails that&#39;ll eject it from the hangar in the worst case scenario.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It might be a bumpy ride, since we&#39;ll have to make the trip by sledding all the way down the mountain, but at least we should be able to make it to the bottom.</p><p><strong>Chaldea Staff:</strong> You got it! Now come on, everyone else is already on board!</p><p><strong>Chaldea Staff:</strong> You three are the only ones left! Let&#39;s get going before they find us!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So you&#39;re all safe! That&#39;s wonderful! I knew Holmes could do it!</p><p><strong>Chaldea Staff:</strong> W-well...all of us who escaped to the west hall, anyway...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Just the west hall...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...Does that mean...</p><hr><p><strong>Chaldea Staff:</strong> ...There&#39;s a wall of ice blocking the way to the east hall. Everyone who escaped there is frozen solid.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What!? But how...!? That shouldn&#39;t even be possible!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Maybe not, but it&#39;s true. I saw it for myself back in the Command Room.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> One girl froze the entire east hall single-handedly. Hard as it is to believe, she&#39;s a Servant.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> She must be a Heroic Spirit who was summoned outside of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> She headed to the Command Room after freezing the east hall, so that might be frozen solid by now too.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> A Servant summoned outside of Chaldea...</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fooou...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But still...How...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Doctor Roman said it was impossible to summon Heroic Spirits without this shield, let alone outside of Chaldea...!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I know. Which is why the circumstances are so precarious. That Heroic Spirit shouldn&#39;t be here; this whole situation shouldn&#39;t even be possible.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> They caught us completely by surprise. We have nothing at all to go on at the moment.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Which is yet another reason why we should beat a temporary retreat.

Why would you risk your necks for a jerk like that!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...Sorry about this, Meunière.

That one sickle hurt like hell...They&#39;re probably not going to kill me quickly, either...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> (I&#39;ve seen these things in the old records...They&#39;re the tsar&#39;s Oprichniki. )</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> (They&#39;re soldiers expressly designed to make humans suffer. Demons in human clothing. )</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> (I don&#39;t know why they&#39;ve come back to life here and now, but...Oh God, this is going to hurt so much...I guess I&#39;m going to die as unlucky as–)</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Well, well!

Wh-wh-what are you all doing here!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> We&#39;re here to rescue you, believe it or not!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Don&#39;t thank me, though.

Do you actually think you&#39;ve helped me just because you&#39;ve saved my life!?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> I&#39;m the REAL victim here! They should have broken up Chaldea after all!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> The Heroic Spirit Summoning System turned out to be a broken-down piece of junk, and the supposed star of the show, Chaldeas, overloaded the moment I got here!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Then I go and lose contact with the outside world, I can&#39;t find Koyanskaya anywhere, and to top things off, I run into those Oprichniks!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> What sort of wickedness have you brought upon us now!? Don&#39;t tell me you went and destroyed the world AGAIN!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Destroyed the...? Um, I&#39;m afraid you&#39;re greatly mistaken...We weren&#39;t the ones responsible for the Incineration of Humanity, but–</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Don&#39;t you DARE talk back to me! Just shut the hell up and start fixing this mess you made!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Oogh, just thinking about it is giving me the shakes!

Anyway, we REALLY don&#39;t have time to explain everything right now.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> For the moment, let&#39;s get back to safety.

The poor thing...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No, Mr. Goredolf, the Oprichniki didn&#39;t capture her. She&#39;s the one leading them!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I don&#39;t know why she did it, but I think she&#39;s the one who orchestrated this attack on Chaldea!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Y-you&#39;re joking! Then, you mean she&#39;s been deceiving me all this time!?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> That she only traveled far and wide and worked herself to the bone so I could land Chaldea for HER sake instead of mine!?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Dammit! You little minx! How dare you toy with an innocent man&#39;s heart like that!?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Oh my, I think we have a misunderstanding,Your Excellency.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> We recommended Chaldea to you as a purchase with tremendous value. We were completely honest about that.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> You saw its value, accepted the offered price, and invested your personal fortune. We assassinated your rival bidders to guarantee your purchase.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> As a result, you gained sole rights over Chaldea and its property, and we were able to complete our objective without the Association interfering.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> That sounds like a win-win to me. But then you go and call me a minx...?</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> I&#39;m normally very gentle,but that really ruffles my feathers.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> So now we&#39;re going to kill you all.

I&#39;ve...I&#39;ve never sensed such fierce bloodlust before...!</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Ooh, I&#39;m impressed, shield girl. I guess you really do know a Servant when you see one.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> But don&#39;t worry your pretty little head, mmkay? I couldn&#39;t care less about other Servants, so I&#39;ll make sure to kill you quickly.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> The only prey I really like to take my time with is of the human variety. The ones I&#39;m really fond of, I like to stuff and mount on my walls.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> In fact, I&#39;ve got quite a nice collection now, if I do say so myself. You know how some people like to hunt foxes? It&#39;s just like that, only with humans.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Goredolf isn&#39;t worth my time, but you just barely make the grade, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> I think you&#39;d look wonderful on my mantle. Oh, but I will have to remove those unsightly limbs first.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Aaah! C-c-come on, Fujimaru,do something! You&#39;re a Master, right!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ve got these soldiers&#39; figured now.

But if you don&#39;t have anything helpful to say, how about you be a dear and shut the hell up!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That said, Fujimaru,I&#39;m afraid Goredolf isn&#39;t totally wrong.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> She IS a Servant. And not the kind we know, either.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...Make sure you&#39;re ready to back me up with those Command Spells.

Better cover my ears!</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> An anti-spiritual body flashbang...</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> She&#39;s a clever inventor, that Servant. But I&#39;m betting she&#39;s just about run out of tricks.</p><p><strong>Koyanskaya:</strong> Let&#39;s go after them, Your Imperial Highness. There&#39;s nowhere left for them to run. They&#39;re trapped like rats.</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong> Rats, rats, rats...There were a lot of rats in that house, too.</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong> All they know how to do is gnaw at their surroundings and multiply...and multiply...</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong> Still, I recognize that that is one of Proper Human History&#39;s greatest strengths.</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong> If their strength lies in multiplying, we will show our strength in eradicating them all the more fiercely.</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong> Our world, the Lostbelt we come from,is a cruel and frigid place.</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong> How laughable to think they consider this mild environment cold.

The trip must have reduced those humans to just red smears on the container walls, right?</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong> Please. This was obviously their plan from the start, and they managed to keep that extra Servant a secret. They must have something else up their sleeve.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong> The Master, the Demi-Servant, Goredolf,and the eight surviving staff members...</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong> That makes eleven precious human lives.

Of course you are! You little devils, you!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Let&#39;s just say this is the sheer, unbridled power of a main character! Bit of a shock seeing me again five minutes after my tragic death scene?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Allow me to explain. That is a spare body Ms. Da Vinci created for herself in case of emergency. It is a relatively low-cost solution, though unfortunately it has a commensurately low output.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> And so she is able to behave as though she is simply picking up where the former Da Vinci left off...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> ...even though she is a low-ranking Servant who only just awakened.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hmph. You there! Black Coat Guy who&#39;s just plain SUCKING at driving this thing!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> What gives with the spoilers? I was waiting for the perfect moment for my big reveal, you know?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> E-excuse me, but...is that true? Are you really Da Vinci?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I sure am. Take a look at these glasses if you don&#39;t believe me.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Mash, Fujimaru, this may be the first time we&#39;re meeting, but I already know all about you.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I inherited all the other me&#39;s memories, after all. I&#39;ve really been looking forward to the day I could meet you all like this!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I might not be quite as capable a Renaissance Woman as the old me, but I hope I can help you out from now on just the same.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> If you&#39;ve quite finished with your introductions, please get back to the controls, Da Vinci.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Need I remind you...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> ...that you are an artificial Servant created expressly for the purpose of piloting this All-Terrain Void-Transporter, the Shadow Border.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Without you, the Shadow Border cannot function at full capacity.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Ugh, you really are a buzzkill, Holmes. You know I can&#39;t talk while I&#39;m in the control tube!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But, this IS an emergency, and everyone&#39;s safety does come first. Guess I&#39;ll just go back to sleep, then.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> We&#39;ll talk later, after things have calmed down. Good night, Fujimaru. Good night, Mash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> G-good night? S-S-Senpai! Who was that tiny Da Vinci!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I am so, so confused...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Shadow Border...?</p><hr><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> What a jump! That was a slope-crossing impact, wasn&#39;t it!?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Correct! I see you&#39;re quite the driving enthusiast, Goredolf!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Wh-why yes, as a matter of fact. I don&#39;t like to brag about it, but I am something of an amateur racer.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> I&#39;m the sponsor, driver, and strategist, all rolled into one. Musik the Phoenix, they call me–</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Now then, we&#39;re about to reach the ice shelf! From there, we&#39;ll head for the coast and the sea beyond!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Ice shelf?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...Coast?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Hm? Oh, that&#39;s right, you don&#39;t know where we are, do you?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Well then! Take a look out the window, [♂ Mr. /♀ Ms. ] Fujimaru! It&#39;s not every day one gets a chance to see scenery like this!</p><p><strong>--SECTION BREAK--</strong></p><p><strong>Priest:</strong> Now, time for our last job.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong> The Pseudo-Celestial Sphere Chaldeas...The miracle that leads to the Root. The miracle that the Animusphere family wished for and dreamed about for over two millennia...</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong> Part of me wishes we didn&#39;t have to trample all over this dream, but such is life.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong> It is the job of adults to teach children the harsh truth of reality. Even the tsar fears this celestial sphere.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong> After all, changing the past via Rayshifting is the one threat we can&#39;t counter.</p><p><strong>H：???:</strong> ...So this is Chaldeas. It looks just like an Easter egg...</p><p><strong>H：???:</strong> So this is the device I must freeze, Father?</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong> That&#39;s right. That is what the tsar wants. You must use your Noble Phantasm to defeat the traitors.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong> You must bury this magnificent crown jewel of humanity yourself, in a coffin of permafrost.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong> What will you do, Your Imperial Highness, Grand Duchess Anastasia?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>--SECTION BREAK--</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Antarctica? We&#39;ve been in Antarctica this whole time!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> But, they told me we were on a huge mountain...!</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Although many nations have claimed this land as their own, the fact remains that it is the last frontier yet to fall into humanity&#39;s grasp.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Chaldea was built right in its center, so that no nation could use it for their own ends.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> It was built on a mountain range hidden by an endless blizzard–or rather, the lingering scent of Mystics–and then further reinforced by a Bounded Field.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> It is the largest, and only, observatory of humanity on the entire planet, its location and secrets concealed from the moment of its creation.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> That is Chaldea, the Security Organization for the Preservation of Humanity. I suppose I ought to say that it WAS Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> As of now, Chaldea has fallen into the hands of an unknown adversary, one who is trying to shut it down even as we speak.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Trying to shut it down...? Even as we speak?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Correct. I&#39;ve confirmed that as of twenty seconds ago, all Command Room transmissions have ceased, and all power output has shut down.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Chaldeas is no longer operating, either. The air-conditioning has stopped, and the inside temperature has dropped below minus one hundred degrees.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> As loath as I am to say it, we must face the facts: Chaldea is lost.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> We no longer have any means of taking it back, or even returning to it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Stop it...Please, stop it! I have to go back to Chaldea! Please, let me go back!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It hasn&#39;t been taken from us yet! I know it hasn&#39;t!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> All my memories of the time I spent with everyone else are there! Nothing can change that!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> And...and...Doctor Roman&#39;s room is still...!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> S-stop that! What do you hope to accomplish by going back now!? Go on, youngster, talk some sense into her!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> [♂ Mr. /♀ Ms. ] Fujimaru, would you mind holding Mash back from–Never mind, there is no need for that. Her body has reached its limit.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I am afraid that is what happens when one transforms while one is unable to properly synchronize with one&#39;s Spirit Origin: all the duress you place on your body comes back to bite you.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> At this point, she lacks even the strength to open the hatch.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I would advise that you sit her down and strap her in before she suffers unnecessary injury.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Hn......!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I&#39;m, sorry...I&#39;m so sorry, everyone...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> If I&#39;d...If I&#39;d only been able to fight as a real Servant...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> This isn&#39;t your fault, Mash.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...You&#39;re wrong. Nobody&#39;s to blame for this.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai...</p><p><strong>Chaldea Staff:</strong> Aw, Mash......Hm? Hang on. What&#39;s that...?</p><p><strong>Chaldea Staff:</strong> Holmes, are you seeing what&#39;s outside the window!?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Of course. I&#39;ve seen it since I took control.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> ...Nevertheless, it IS hard to believe. One could be forgiven for thinking it a bad dream.</p><p><strong>Chaldea Staff:</strong> Are those meteoroids!? But we didn&#39;t get any reports from Panama!</p><p><strong>Chaldea Staff:</strong> If there were meteoroids too big to burn up in the atmosphere headed this way, we would&#39;ve heard!</p><p><strong>Chaldea Staff:</strong> And what&#39;s with those trajectories!? How can they possibly be falling straight down like that!?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> An occurrence that defies human understanding, hm?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> That tells us they cannot be meteoroids. I believe we can rule out debris as well.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Which means this can only be something once relegated to fiction. For example, an invasion from outer space.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> You&#39;re joking, right? Who could say something like that with a straight face!?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> I-I mean, that would just be absurd, right? Or what, are you really saying those people were aliens?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> That they only pretended to be human in order to take over Chaldea? How can–</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> My apologies, but please, do be quiet. We&#39;re picking up an external transmission. It&#39;s using the same frequency you did at Chaldea.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...anity. We have a message for all of humanity.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> This planet will soon be reborn as an old, brand-new world.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Human civilization was a mistake. The path of our growth was incorrect.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> And so I have made my decision. I will revolt against all of human history–Proper Human History.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> We are about to fill this world with inhuman Mystic secrets. We will restore the Age of Gods.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> To that end, the gods have descended from a far-off galaxy, and in their wisdom, they have used seven seeds to select new leaders.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> These leaders will remake this planet as they see fit. And the one who reign supreme shall be given the right to renew the world itself.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> The life-forms from Proper Human History will not be permitted to take part in this war, or even to view it from the sidelines.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> The roots of cosmic fantasy have descended upon us. Trees of creation have sprung up all across the land.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Now, all of the old humanity&#39;s endeavors will be set aside, frozen.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Thus shall you atone for your sins.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> 2019...The year that Proper Human History came to an end.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> My name is Wodime. Kirschtaria Wodime.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> On behalf of the seven Crypters, I have a message for those of you who escaped from Chaldea.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> No, rather, I have a message for the scant few remnants of the human race: WE will be the inheritors of this world&#39;s history.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Kirschtaria...? That did SOUND like Kirschtaria, but...</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Kirschtaria Wodime!? The leader of Team A!?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Here I was going to take him under my wing,and this is the thanks I get...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Crypter...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> The end of human history...?</p><hr><p><strong>Chaldea Staff:</strong> NOW what is it!?</p><p><strong>P. A. System</strong> Emergency from the computer room! Emergency from the computer room!</p><p><strong>P. A. System</strong> Hey there! It&#39;s me, Da Vinci,the one controlling the Border all by my lonesome☆</p><p><strong>P. A. System</strong> We&#39;re less than two thousand meters away from the coast now, but I&#39;m afraid we&#39;ve got a little problem to deal with first.</p><p><strong>P. A. System</strong> I&#39;m picking up a TON of Spirit Origin signals up ahead. It&#39;s more of the soldiers that attacked Chaldea.</p><p><strong>P. A. System</strong> I&#39;m counting about...Well, see for yourself! As they say, a picture&#39;s worth a thousand words!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...! It IS those soldiers that attacked Chaldea...!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> H-how can there even be that many!? Dammit! Looks like a whole damn division out there! The hell is this!?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fooou!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> They&#39;re covering the entire coastline...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...It&#39;s over...</p><hr><p><strong>P. A. System</strong> There&#39;s no way our Border here can break through a group like that. If we try to charge them, we&#39;ll all be dead way before we hit the water!</p><p><strong>P. A. System</strong> Holmes! Hard right! We&#39;ll have to give up on the ship and try for another observatory!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I&#39;m afraid that won&#39;t work, Da Vinci. We&#39;re getting no response from the American base.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> In fact, according to the sonar, there is nothing to be found anywhere. Surely you can see that yourself.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> As long as we remain in Antarctica, we have no chance of victory. If the enemy forces who occupied Chaldea catch up to us, we will be quite finished.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Our only hope for survival is to plow through that mass of soldiers and pray we make it out to sea.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> You&#39;d bet all our lives on THAT!? What are you, an idiot!? We can&#39;t possibly break through that army!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Even if we did somehow make it out to sea,the ship is bound to be hijacked by now!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> It would only be a matter of time before they catch up to this broken-down truck and slaughter us all!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> That&#39;s one opinion. [♂ Mr. /♀ Ms. ] Fujimaru,tell me, what do you think?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Do you have some sort of plan?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Hey, Sherlock Holmes IS a man of adventure, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Quite right! This is an adventure,and one of the grandest ones imaginable at that.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> It&#39;s certainly not some boring escapade where we barrel our way through an army of horrific killers.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> No, this will be humanity&#39;s first magecraft voyage. To date, humankind has traveled to the moon, the subterranean world, and even through time.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> This voyage will be unlike any of those trips,though no less grand in ambition.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> The world we hope to visit is one that cannot exist without being defined, even as it lies in a domain beyond our reach.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> In other words, we will be attempting to travel to a world that exists on the negative vector.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> Wh...what did you just say? You can&#39;t mean...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Da Vinci. Permission to use the Paper Moon.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> The Atlas Institute may not have cleared me for it,but I&#39;m quite familiar with its operation.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> After all, I got a rather thorough look at its top secret manual while I was in their headquarters.</p><p><strong>G：P. A. System</strong> Tri-Hermes at the Atlas Institute, hmm. You detective types are always on the job, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>G：P. A. System</strong> Still, be honest with me: How good do you think our odds are of pulling that off? Better than if we tried to fight those soldiers?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Thirty percent at best, I should think. For that matter, I can&#39;t even be sure where we&#39;ll end up.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> If all we wish to do is make it out of this predicament alive, I have no doubt there are better options available.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> But, if you have your sights set further than that, this is the one I recommend. I believe it will aid us in fighting this adversary in the future.</p><p><strong>P. A. System</strong> ...Understood. Expanding Void-Reality Observation Device: Paper Moon.</p><p><strong>P. A. System</strong> Expanding Logic Formula on Shadow Border&#39;s external armor. Removing existence verification for Reality Space.</p><p><strong>P. A. System</strong> Future prediction: hypothetically prove mirror world plane in twenty seconds. Relaxing space-time friction decompression for 0. 6 seconds.</p><p><strong>P. A. System</strong> ...Emergency processes, all green. Looking good, Holmes! We&#39;re all set for our maiden voyage!</p><p><strong>P. A. System</strong> Now then, a little heads-up for those of you in the cockpit!</p><p><strong>P. A. System</strong> Your souls will almost leave your body for a moment, but don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll be fine! It&#39;s just your average out-of-body experience!</p><p><strong>P. A. System</strong> But if you find yourself saying stuff like “I-I&#39;m floating? ” or “Is that my own body I&#39;m looking at? ”...</p><p><strong>P. A. System</strong> ...just reach out, grab your body, and hold on for dear life! As long as you do that, you&#39;ll come out the other end alive!</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> How is any of that “fine”!? You&#39;ve just said you&#39;re literally going to kill us!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou fou. Nnn, fooou.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master...! I still don&#39;t understand what&#39;s going on. Are you sure about this...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Sure I&#39;m sure!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Just another day at the office.</p><hr><p><strong>P. A. System</strong> Now that&#39;s the Fujimaru I know! Then without further ado, let&#39;s get started.</p><p><strong>P. A. System</strong> Although this Phenomenon Intervention Method we&#39;re about to attempt is one of the first Chaldea ever devised, we banned its use because of its extreme difficulty and danger.</p><p><strong>P. A. System</strong> You know how Rayshifting involves breaking a Master down into Spiritrons and outputting them into space-time as numeric values? Well, this way of traveling through space is the exact opposite.</p><p><strong>P. A. System</strong> We&#39;ll be slipping through a crack in this world into a Sea of Time, completely erasing our existence from reality.</p><p><strong>P. A. System</strong> ...We have a lot on our plates right now. An adversary that attacked Chaldea. Those things that fell from space. The Crypters.</p><p><strong>P. A. System</strong> Like Mash said, we don&#39;t know WHAT&#39;S going on right now.</p><p><strong>P. A. System</strong> But one thing we know for sure is that they&#39;re all enemies–threats to humanity that even destroyed Chaldea.</p><p><strong>P. A. System</strong> If we&#39;re going to do something about all this, we&#39;ll have to start breaking even more forbidden taboos.</p><p><strong>P. A. System</strong> We are NOT handing over the future we worked so hard to take back to a bunch of newcomers we don&#39;t know the first thing about.</p><p><strong>P. A. System</strong> So first, we find a way out of this mess. Then, we strike back.</p><p><strong>P. A. System</strong> Well, let&#39;s get going, Master Fujimaru. We have a new weapon, and a new course ahead of us...</p><p><strong>P. A. System:</strong> Shadow Border, untether from reality.
