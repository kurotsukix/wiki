The only person in the world capable of defeating him is Iskandar.</p><p><strong>Darius III:</strong><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png" alt="berserk2">\u2013!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Therefore he was invincible.

I wonder why he even came here in the first place.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I know Fujimaru had a feeling, that in this era\u2013</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Darius has some business here in the 1st Century Rome, an era no longer affected by the Grail. But...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> He is a Berserker, after all.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I have no idea what he&#39;s saying, either.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Well... It is incredibly difficult to understand what he&#39;s thinking.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Foou...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> At any rate, we don&#39;t know why the skeleton soldiers are here!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> But he sure intends to defeat all the monsters here! So he should be satisfied once all of them are defeated.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> We&#39;ll just have to trust that he won&#39;t be angry if we take some of his prey! All right\u2013Shall we do this?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You bet!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Mash, prepare for battle!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, Master!

Why did you come to this era?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Did you bring us here because you sensed something, and figured out why the monsters were showing up?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> This is ancient Rome, after all.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Maybe there&#39;s someone here he knows?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s some phenomenon here that&#39;s related to him\u2013</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Ahh... Yes. So it seems. Well, there does seem to be some phenomenon related to him.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> We&#39;ve just finished a preliminary analysis, and the origin of the skeleton soldier and ghost spawning is</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> \u2013the presence of His Majesty Darius himself!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> How can that be?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Oh! His Noble Phantasm!</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Yes. Well, you see, it&#39;s the Noble Phantasm he carries. &quot;Athanaton Ten Thousand.&quot;</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> That Noble Phantasm is based on his ten thousand elite soldiers who actually existed, and his legend of unyielding valor.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Along with the legend of their &quot;immortality,&quot; they&#39;ve actually ended up becoming indestructible...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Immortality\u2013I see.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> That&#39;s what&#39;s behind this. His Noble Phantasm is able to summon skeleton soldiers and ghosts.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> This location is the recent battlefield where Nero&#39;s Roman Army and the United Empire Army clashed.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> That&#39;s why the undead kept showing up.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I see... So... That&#39;s... What&#39;s... Happening.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Foo, fou...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Now, that&#39;s one crazy private army generator...

Do you sense anything!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Hmm...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> His power is greater than before.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> His attacks are faster than before! He&#39;s clearly on a rampage!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Watch your magical energy consumption, Senpai. A Berserker&#39;s full power will drain a Master energy fast!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Foou! Kyuu!!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> A-Anyway, let&#39;s use the same strategy as last time!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> At this rate, Fujimaru won&#39;t last at all.

Senpai!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Mash, prepare for battle!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Crush those that get past Darius!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Understood, Master!

I&#39;m afraid this time the situation is different.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> \u2013There&#39;s a Servant here.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> It&#39;s been a while.

Because you called to me so much\u2013</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> It seems I ended up being chain summoned by you. Maybe this place is still affected by the Grail?</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> I do have to say, your determination sure is strong. Since I&#39;m like this, I can&#39;t really grasp the impact of my later years.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> But I have nothing but respect for you. O brave king of Persia.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> \u2013Darius III.</p><p><strong>Darius III:</strong><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png" alt="berserk1">!!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Sheesh!

In that case, I think I&#39;ll just have to face him.</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Since how we are summoned is reversed from last time, it would be fun to also reverse our roles in life!</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> You&#39;ll be the one marching onward! And I shall be the one who stands in your way!</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> The king who will eventually stand before me, no, who stood before me, Darius III! Come!</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Let&#39;s battle it out! Just how much I can fight in this form\u2013</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> I&#39;ve always wanted to test it out!

But what&#39;s there is probably a different Servant!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Different? No, this feeling...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Wahahahahaha!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> How amusing! My youthful self and my former beloved rival fought! Quite exhilarating! But the outcome was expected.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Not enough! What could that young pup accomplish by relying so much on Bucephalus?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> My opponent is the dauntless giant king! None other than the last king of the Achaemenid Empire, Darius III!</p><p><strong>Darius III:</strong><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png" alt="berserk1">\u2013!!!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Ooh! Ooh! You&#39;re quite pleased to see me, I can tell!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> There are none that can stand before you, not even my youthful self!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> You died and transformed into a Heroic Spirit! You magnificently assimilated ten thousand soldiers, King Darius!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> If anyone can defeat you\u2013 It can only be me, Iskandar the Conqueror!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Uh?!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Iskandar! It&#39;s Alexander in his later years... Without a doubt, it is the King of Conquerors!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Th-That&#39;s one incredible, super-famous hero! I didn&#39;t think the influence of the Holy Grail was still so strong in this area!</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> No, this has nothing to do with the Holy Grail! Someone has relentlessly insisted on calling me!</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> Someone none other than you!

Let&#39;s go at it with everything we&#39;ve got!</p><p><strong>Darius III:</strong><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png" alt="berserk2">\u2013!!!</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> Wahahahahaha!! What a joy! Let us cross swords again!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Darius III:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> What&#39;s going on? Why did you suddenly turn into a tame kitten? Is that all you&#39;ve got?

Well, to tell the truth, I have reached my limit as well.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> Not only was I not properly summoned, I was forcefully materialized without a Holy Grail\u2013</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> It only makes sense it turned out like this. Darius III, you are the enormous wall that stood before me.</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> Now that your magical energy supply is down, my voice probably won&#39;t reach you anymore\u2013</p><p><strong>Iskandar:</strong> But the next time we meet, let&#39;s face each other\u2013</p><p><strong>Darius III:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Servant Iskandar, elimination confirmed. \u2013The battle is over.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Whew.
