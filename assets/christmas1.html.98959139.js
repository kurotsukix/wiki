Senpai&#39;s gone, Fou.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Are you taking a shower, Senpai? Or using the toilet?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> How... ...Nowhere to be found... But there&#39;s no doubt Senpai was in this room...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> There&#39;s no record of a heat signature leaving this room in the last hour either\u2014 It&#39;s as if...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Clearly, there&#39;s been some kind of foul play here! Let&#39;s go get the Doctor!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> \u2014Huh?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Emerging from the Rayshift tunnel, your eyes were met with the sight of a field blanketed in snow...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> A most literary beginning. The use of the second-person lends a certain subtlety to the sentence. Don&#39;t you think, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That voice! Could it be\u2014?!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Ha! A lively response. I am possessed of a sudden desire to kick you in your arse.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Though our contract is but a temporary one, any Master seeking to transport me must be as so.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You were in the Massive Cavern?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> ...No. This is my first meeting with you. Can you not tell from my attire?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> I&#39;ve certainly never been defeated by you, and have, under no circumstances, been brooding over it.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> I was simply in a foul mood, especially my stomach. All because Archer wouldn&#39;t cook a sound meal.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> ...No, that is not it. I am precisely as you see me to be.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> A mi-miniskirt... Alter</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> ...A m-miniskirt, you say? Well, I suppose one could see it as such.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> But mind it not, and allow me to say this in advance. One who would be Santa is unbothered by the cold!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Allow me to introduce myself. I am Santa Alter. I am a Santa Claus of Evil who slashes apart the icy breath of Midwinter!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> ...You seem to misunderstand me. I merely wish to express my daily gratitude by delivering presents to all.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> However\u2014 After going through the trouble of gathering presents, I have lost my means of transporting them.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> The reindeer that I had hired previously to pull my sleigh have all run away in fear.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> What a bunch of cowards. All I did was use Excalibur Morgan as a jet engine to propel us into the stratosphere.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> I could pull the sleigh myself, but such a thing would tarnish the dignity of Santa Claus.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> I cannot capture the heart of children everywhere without a reindeer. Which is why\u2014 You understand, don&#39;t you, good Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> It is for that purpose alone that I have unsummoned you here by force.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> As a part of my daily gratitude to you, I bestow upon you the honor of being my reindeer.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> This is part of your duty as a king?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> No. I am not a king here, but a Santa Claus! Kindly refer to me in those terms.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You didn&#39;t have anyone else you could ask, did you?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> That is untrue! Of those I considered there was one, at least, with promise!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> But they were rather hesitant, and worse yet, extremely frail. Thus, I sent them packing.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> However, their eyes were so bright they would have made a perfect red-nosed reindeer...</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Honestly... Even if it is Christmastime, one should have limits to how much one lets loose.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> ...No, wait a moment. It seems the presents have drawn some uninvited guests.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> And I was in the middle of my presentation... But there&#39;s nothing to be done about it. Take up your sword, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Your body shall know what it means to go into battle with Santa\u2014!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> As you can see, many try to target Santa Claus. Reindeer must be as strong as their master.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Now then, you understand what I&#39;m saying, don&#39;t you? You are now my reindeer. I won&#39;t hear any objections.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Rest assured, I am a Santa and not a demon. If you work hard, I shall grant you your life, at least\u2014</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yes, ma&#39;am, I&#39;m ready to start right now!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Yes, Santa Alter!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Humph! That was a quick response! Are you a lion cub, unschooled in fear? How promising!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Nonetheless, it was a good answer. I am pleased. Now, let us start immediately.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> First, let us storm this house nearby. As Santa, I must attack from the skies.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Now, board the sleigh, Master! I shall enlighten you on the ways of Santa!</p><h2 id="_1st-night-little-darius" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_1st-night-little-darius" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 1st Night: Little Darius</h2><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Forward, my soldiers! Tear through the darkness! Plunge into the blizzard! Wander! Wander!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> This sleigh really flies through the air!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Naturally. One who would be Santa must be able to traverse the skies. We must deliver presents to the children around the world.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> I&#39;ve dubbed this sleigh Llamrei Unit II. You may relax your guard and entrust yourself to it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Why are you yelling?!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Insolent fool! I am not yelling. I am singing!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> By announcing my presence this way, I can also avoid running into airplanes! It&#39;s common sense for a Santa!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Good. We are approaching our destination. Prepare yourself, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> The return address of this \u201CDear Santa\u201D letter is in Persia. A request from Darius, aged 3.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> ...Hmm. The writing is so black and smeared I can&#39;t read it at all. Well, I&#39;m sure once I see his face, I&#39;ll know what present he&#39;d like.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Let us go! We shall enter from this magnificent chimney!</p><p><strong>Lu Bu:</strong> [[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]! [[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]!</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong> Ahh... The iron lament that surpasses the vocal cords... Echoing from the depths of the hollow, the enamored yet hate-filled voice of a young girl&#39;s lingering affections as she \u201Csings\u201D of death...</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong> Specifically, I should call it the raging moans of a girl who can no longer abide her hunger. Ahh, how unsightly yet adorable\u2014!</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong> Though it&#39;s a far cry from my own taste, she conveys her feelings so well it truly pains me.</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong> A cry that would pierce Heaven itself. You who spews forth such hatred, I&#39;d liken you to... Yes, a carp swimming up a waterfall.</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong> Actually, you are more like a carp banner. How auspicious. Ahh, how very auspicious indeed... And hateful, too!</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong> Christine! Christine has gone so far from me! Why? Why does fate endeavor to tear us apart yet again?</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong> Couples! Christmas! Santa Claus! Whenever I hear that this is a night for loved ones, it makes me sick!</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong> Don&#39;t you agree, Sir Carp Banner? Why must we, upon such a night as this, be a company entirely of men?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> ...What a ferocious cry from the soul. It stirs the heart too greatly. Surely, that Servant is an actor of some renown.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yeah, that was quite an elegy.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Ehh, it was certainly a self-indulgent soliloquy.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> What a splendid performance. He probably has more passion in his pinky than that cursed Tristan...</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> ...But I can&#39;t imagine that either of them is Darius. Also, that object in the middle of the floor...</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> There&#39;s nothing here but that tree-like candle in the center of the room. Does that mean Darius isn&#39;t here?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> That&#39;s fine, then. I should simply turn around and leave now, but I do pity these two.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Merlin has said that when a man is widowed, his suffering surpasses the pain of Death. As Santa, I can&#39;t just leave them be.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Let us go, Fujimaru! We shall be like the Christmas Carol that saved Scrooge!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Bow down, little ones! Prepare to receive your presents from me!</p><p><strong>Lu Bu:</strong> [[File:berserkervoice2.png50px]]???</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong> Oh, Christine! You&#39;ve come back to me, Christine!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Ugh. Halt, Black Mantle! Do not approach my reindeer.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Laying hands upon your audience is a third-rate performer&#39;s action. Are you not a world-class actor after all?</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong> What? I, a world-class...actor, you say? I, the specter of this miserable underground hovel?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> I never engage in flattery. You rave as though mad, but your cries are filled with truth. So much so I am moved to tears.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> But more importantly, where is the master of this castle? The sender of this letter to Santa should be here.</p><p><strong>Lu Bu:</strong> [[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]!</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong> Santa... Ahh, Beautiful One, what tragedy is this? Now that I look more carefully, you are, indeed, Santa Claus!</p><p><strong>Darius III:</strong> Ohh... Oooohhhh! Santa... Santaaaaaaa!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> ?! This candle tree moves?! You two, just what is the meaning of this?</p><p><strong>Lu Bu:</strong> [[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]!</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong> Die, please. Repent! And surrender what&#39;s in that bag! Santa Claus is the one who should be struck from this world!</p><p><strong>Darius III:</strong> Oooohhhhh! Presents! Gimme!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Well! Only naughty little children try to take things by force like that! We&#39;ve no choice. Prepare to fight, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> After all, it is also Santa&#39;s duty to give dreamy-eyed children a cold jolt of reality!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yeah, but I don&#39;t see any \u201Clittle children\u201D here!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Santa&#39;s more violent than I&#39;d imagined!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Minor details. Worry not! All one really needs to be Santa is to hand out presents.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Not even Picts, and raising such a ruckus indoors? Such poor manners. It&#39;s Christmas. Take this fight outside!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Have you learned your lesson, ruffians? The form of Santa Claus pleases me greatly but it is only a temporary one.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> My true form is that of Britain&#39;s Red Dragon, Altria, the King of Knights. Remember it well.</p><p><strong>Lu Bu:</strong> [[File:berserkervoice2.png50px]]... ...(looking dejected)</p><p><strong>Darius III:</strong> Ohhh... Santa... Claaaus... Santa... Claaaaauuss...</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong> Anguish... Anguish... Anguish... When I think of what we&#39;ve done... Oh, the anguish...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Doesn&#39;t he look a little odd?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...Well, Your Majesty, don&#39;t welook like the bad guys here?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> ...Yes, it is starting to feel that way to me as well. This being my first job, perhaps I got a bit too hot-headed.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> You there. You understand the speech of these other two, correct? Is that tree Darius, aged three, by any chance?</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong> Yes, he is... His king is, in fact, the green light that burns in Hell, the Lord Cyalume... And who might you be, my lady?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> I already told you I was Santa Claus. Now, accept your presents.</p><p><strong>Lu Bu:</strong> [[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]!</p><p><strong>Darius III:</strong> Ohhhh! Presents! Gimme!!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> There, there. This is for you.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Since you would die before you could ever use a Noble Phantasm, use this to amass a little motivation, or perhaps a little love.</p><p><strong>Lu Bu:</strong> [[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]!</p><p><strong>Darius III:</strong> Hurraaaaay!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> As for you, Black Mantle, I shall give you... Yes, this.</p><p><strong>Phantom:</strong> Oh! This is the very thing I have lost! My love, my light! Christine! You&#39;ve brought her back to me!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> As I said, do not come near my reindeer. We are busy. We have a mountain of work to do.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Let us go, Fujimaru. Santa should be as a passing breeze. We must not stay long.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> And it is painful to have to leave a party early, since my hunger is never satiated.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Well, then\u2014 Farewell, little ones! Let us meet again next year! Merry Christmas!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> All right. They were the perfect companions for some light warm-up. Now it&#39;s time for you to work, my reindeer.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> From now until the end of Christmas, many more battles await us, I am sure.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> At each stop, gather the stockings and bring them to me. Stockings are the crystallizations of the hearts of children seeking presents...</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> It is by the power of such magical energy that Santa Claus traverses the globe. In other words, you could call it our fuel.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> The more you gather, the greater the reward I shall bestow upon you. Remember that as you go about your work.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> The next \u201CDear Santa\u201D letter is on the 2nd. Let us build up our party until then!</p><h2 id="_2nd-night-her-name-is-little-marie" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2nd-night-her-name-is-little-marie" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 2nd Night: Her Name is Little Marie</h2><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Good work with your reindeer training. You&#39;re fighting Christmas monsters when you have time, right?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Thanks to your efforts, the fuel for my sleigh... The Santa Points have been building up nicely.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Now I can deliver the next present. Good work, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Let&#39;s go over this one more time Christmas celebrates the birth of a certain person.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> It is the mass of Christ, hence the word Christmas.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> These days, Christmas Eve is December 24th, and the 25th itself is Christmas.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> But the original period was much longer. His birth was celebrated for days, reaching its peak on the 25th.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> In other words, beginning my advance this early is Santa&#39;s old way of doing it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;re doing it the classic way.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Of course. Function follows form. Destroying everything thoroughly is the classic way to win.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Advance? Like a military advance?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> I see our destination. Give me your magical energy, Reindeer!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> This \u201CDear Santa\u201D letter is from Marie, a girl who lives in France.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Two of her friends are always fighting, so she wants a present to bring them together, it says.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Humph. How stupid. Santa only grants one&#39;s own wishes.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> I have no presents to bring happiness to other people. What does this Marie think Christmas is about, anyway?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Sounds like a mistake Marie would make.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> That&#39;s right. If she wants to bring them together, she should pick a present herself.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> She should do what I did. I once sent two knights who were fighting a single horse, and told them this...</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> \u201CThis is for the one who thinks they&#39;re better than the other.\u201D I knew this would test them and form a friendship.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> It worked perfectly. They stopped arguing in front of others. Although they were trying so hard not to snap at each other when they smiled, but oh well.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> That was Agravain&#39;s idea. Aggy always gave me the best advice.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Sounds like a mistake you&#39;d make.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> I&#39;m not making any mistakes.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Santa brings gifts. She does not bring happiness.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Whether the gifts bring happiness depends on if the little ones have been good or not.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> ...Hmm? This should be the insertion point... But it&#39;s a snowy field.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> The French Marie is without a doubt a member of the royal family.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> I was expecting her Christmas party to be nationwide chaos, with mountains of expensive turkeys...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Found you! That&#39;s your last airspace violation, Santa Claus!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> What!? We&#39;re 2,000 meters in the air! Don&#39;t you think that&#39;s crazy?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> That&#39;s my line! What&#39;s with that hippo sleigh? Are you kidding me?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Also a date in the sky with Master was going to be my thing! Don&#39;t steal it from me!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What is that eagle...bird?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> That&#39;s a hippogriff, Reindeer. It&#39;s often mistaken for a griffin.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> I mistake them often myself. Neither is as good as a dragon, so don&#39;t waste time remembering.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ARGH! Don&#39;t think that firepower equals strength! How short-sighted can you be?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Wow, that&#39;s so cool!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Huh...it is? Am I... Cool? I&#39;m used to being called cute...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...but \u201Ccool\u201D is new. You&#39;re making me blush... Hehe.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> ...Maybe I&#39;ll crush them. More specifically, I&#39;ll smack you hard right between the legs.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Humph. I don&#39;t like that kind of sexual prejudice. That&#39;s not a weak point for me anyway.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Hmmph, target sighted! Marie, up here! Fire everything you&#39;ve got!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> What!?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> We&#39;ve been hit! Grab on, Reindeer! We&#39;re crash-landing!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Tch. They shot down Santa Claus! Is this the French way? I knew I shouldn&#39;t trust them!</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> That&#39;s my line, you suspicious woman! Go back to Santa Claus village!</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Oh my. That&#39;s rude to Finland, d&#39;Eon. The fault lies entirely with this wicked Santa.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Hehehe. I&#39;ve never felt so violent before. It&#39;s exciting! Shooting a cannon is fun\u2661</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Not interested in negotiations, huh? You&#39;re after my sack of presents, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Very well. Santa is destined to be a target for thieves. I&#39;ll deal with you before I go see Marie.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Let&#39;s go, Master! We can ride that merry-go-round after we&#39;re done!</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> ...Huh? Do I have the wrong person? Maybe Astolfo&#39;s got bad eyesight...</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> It doesn&#39;t matter. Tonight&#39;s a festival night! Little problems will melt away with the snow.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Vive la France! My dear, gallant Santa, do you like snowball fights?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> ...Such amazing bladework. This couldn&#39;t be Santa, could it?</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Oh, didn&#39;t you realize when the fight started? This isn&#39;t the same Santa Claus as before.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> I-I&#39;m sorry... I wasn&#39;t thinking straight... But my queen, if you noticed then why didn&#39;t you stop?</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> I&#39;m sorry, but I wanted to keep the momentum going! You had fun too, didn&#39;t you Santa?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Of course. It&#39;s good to revisit one&#39;s childhood. I&#39;m sorry for being so rough with your knight.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> By the way, that well-bred dog... Are you perhaps Marie?</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Yes, I am Marie. You read my letter, didn&#39;t you, Santa?</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> (Dog... That Chimera was a dog? That definitely wasn&#39;t a papillon, but if the queen says so...)</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> I&#39;m here! ...Wait. Is the fight over already? I don&#39;t get to fight?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> So this is everyone, huh? It seems there was a misunderstanding, but it&#39;s solved now.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> I&#39;ll give you your presents then. Line up, you violent children.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Okay! Come on d&#39;Eon, Astolfo, let&#39;s line up!</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> Huh? ...I get a present too? Are you actually a nice person, even though you don&#39;t look like one?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> That last part was unnecessary. You and I should get along. You have my respect.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Men&#39;s attire in France is really elegant, isn&#39;t it, Knight? Give me more details later. I like those frills.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> I am not cross-dressing! I am a man as you can see!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> ...You heard them. Anything you want to say, Hippo?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Why are you asking me? What&#39;s wrong with a girl dressing like a boy?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> People should wear the clothes that suit them. I think d&#39;Eon&#39;s letting clothes run their life, though...</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> You&#39;re too free-spirited! You, Roland... Are the 12 Paladins filled with nothing with perverts?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Huh? Comparing me to Roland isn&#39;t fair!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> He&#39;s the type who wind up in handcuffs. I get my name in the papers!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> I&#39;m glad you&#39;re all getting along. Let me see...</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> This is for you, Marie. I hope it gives you inspiration for the Merry-Go-Round.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Oh my! A glass horse! Thank you, Santa!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Next is the Knight. You get this.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> A m-maid? Why do I get a maid outfit? Am I supposed to wear this?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> It&#39;s a message to at least make better food than the cat. That is, if anyone will take you at this point.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> I&#39;ll be single for the rest of my life! Even as a Servant!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> I see. I think we&#39;ll get along well there, too. Give me your contact info later.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> ...Now then.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> ...(Excited)</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Let&#39;s go, Reindeer. Farewell, and see you next year!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> H-Hold it\u2014! What about me? What do I get, Santa?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Nothing! He who does not fight shall not get presents! You were too lazy to save Orleans!</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> She&#39;s got you there. Even Atalante showed up as an enemy.</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> What!? That wasn&#39;t my fault!</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> The France chapter ended a long time ago! That means I couldn&#39;t possibly\u2014oww!?</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Oh my. I guess Santa gave you a present after all.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> A Halloween pumpkin... What does that mean?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Um... Maybe that I&#39;m cute like a pumpkin?</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> Aww, she said those mean things but she actually loves me... Tehehe.</p><p><strong>d&#39;Eon:</strong> No, I think she&#39;s saying you&#39;re an idiot who was late for the party. This is a Craft Essence that&#39;s past its expiration date.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Oh, I get it! It means \u201CYou won&#39;t be in anything until next year&#39;s Halloween.\u201D</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> What? \u2014I-M-P-O-S-S-I-B-LE! That can&#39;t be right!

Do you hear that strange sound?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> It&#39;s like someone&#39;s repeatedly hitting heavy meat with a blunt object, or endlessly pounding a bag filled with sand.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...I&#39;ve got a bad feeling about this.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...I can guess who that is.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> You&#39;re pretty perceptive. I wouldn&#39;t have guessed. ...Well, once we go inside, we&#39;ll find out even if we don&#39;t want to.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> This time it&#39;s a cave, so there&#39;s no chimney here. We&#39;ll go in through that door in the front.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Hahh! Hahh! Whew! What&#39;s wrong! With people! On Christmas?!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> They say it&#39;s about celebrating His birth, so why! Are all these couples! Exchanging presents!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> No, it&#39;s fine. It&#39;s fine, Martha. Showing your beloved how you feel is a good thing.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> The problem is! Wimps! Who can&#39;t even ask a girl out! Unless it&#39;s on Christmas!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> And His birthday was October, anyway!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> And why are they playing! Sappy pop songs! On a day! Like this!?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> ...It fell. No, it snapped. The chain holding that sandbag just snapped.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I saw</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> You&#39;ve got that right, Martha. If someone wants to send presents, they can do it any time.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> I went and got the enemy general&#39;s head for my brother the instant the idea came to me. He refused it for some reason, though.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> ...My Lord said something similar, actually.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> I went hunting monsters, and they said they wanted a demon&#39;s heart, not their head. \u201CStop that, it&#39;s scary,\u201D they said.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> Hehe... Both them and my brother want so little. It&#39;s such a virtue to be so not-greedy.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> I think they said something about needing eyeballs a while ago.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> If they want me to do it, I&#39;ll pull all the eyeballs off a Demon God pillar, but...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> Unfortunately, I&#39;ve been given no such order. I wish they&#39;d give me some kind of mission...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> ...so crazy that it could make you shiver just hearing about it...</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Fujimaru, do you know that woman who doesn&#39;t know how to work out her stress problems, or the loyal dog with the broken brakes?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Well, it doesn&#39;t matter. Excuse me! I&#39;m told Jean Kay is here!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Huh? Who&#39;s there! How long have you been there?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Since just now. I mean it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I saw nothing. I saw nothing.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Reindeer is right. We&#39;re here to see Jean Kay.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> I&#39;m not at all interested in the things you were saying that would freak out Master if they heard them.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> \u2014Ahem. So you&#39;re here for Jing Ke, right?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Welcome to this distant cave, which normally no one should ever visit.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I can see you&#39;re two... Um, two travelers, right? Please, sit down.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I&#39;ll get dinner ready. Once you have some warm soup, please kindly get out, okay?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> No need for that. Once we&#39;re done here we will leave. Where is Jean Kay?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> You mean Jing Ke? Oh, she&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> What&#39;s up? Did somebody call me\u2014?</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> Oh, looks like we&#39;ve got more company! Hey Martha, are you going to cook?</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> Add in an order of seared beef, too. Some sea turtle soup would also be great!</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> Everything you make is delicious, Martha. I don&#39;t know why the world&#39;s men aren&#39;t banging down your door.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> You&#39;re so lazy! All you do is lay around and you never help with the cooking.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> If I had my staff I&#39;d be teaching you a lesson, Jing Ke! What happened to the normal, gallant you?</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> Aww. C&#39;mon, just make it! Pretty please! I really like the meat dishes you make!</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> Yukhoe? Is that what you call that stuff? Those thin slices of beef you eat raw. It&#39;s so good with wine!</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> But how do you manage to grind the meat without a blade?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Wha\u2014t is this?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Definitely a drunk!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Definitely a cutie!</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> Hmm? Ushiwakamaru, did you get smaller? What&#39;s with the black clothes? Going to war?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> I&#39;m sorry, honored guests.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> Jing Ke began drinking to recover from a traumatic event, and that was ten days ago. Now she&#39;s totally toasted.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> I see... She couldn&#39;t wait for me, huh? I should&#39;ve come here first. Forgive me.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> But don&#39;t worry. Santa Claus is here for you, little drunkard... No, I mean office lady!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> I&#39;ve come to deliver your present!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> What? Did you say Santa Claus? Now that you mention it, you do dress like one...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> ...Heh, you&#39;ve got guts. What makes you think you can just come back and... Never mind.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I&#39;m gonna smash up your face! Get ready, you villain!</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> What? Another Santa? Give me a gift card for a good yakiniku place! I want some beef tongue!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I knew they&#39;d attack us!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What did Santa do?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> ...Looks like this is starting to make sense.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> There&#39;s lots I want to ask, but it can wait until after the battle.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> You young ladies who want to spend your Christmas having a party in a gloomy cave\u2014</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> This is a royal order! Once I beat you, go try and find yourselves boyfriends!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> I lost\u2014! So close! I just needed nine more steps!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> I give up\u2014!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Tch... How could I lose twice to this thief... Is it the staff? ...Am I not cut out for a staff after all?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Hmph. You&#39;ve finally calmed down, huh? You seem to have it out for Santa Claus.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Something happened, right? Tell me.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> What do you mean? A Santa Claus came here before.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> When I said, \u201CYay! Presents! Santa, I want a new set of German cooking knives!\u201D and got all excited...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> ...That Santa made us sign some weird form and then put our stamp on it...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> ...and the next thing we knew we were forced to buy expensive presents with our own money...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> That&#39;s not all. When they found out we didn&#39;t have enough money, they confiscated our stuff!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> What is that? Some kind of new sales technique? When did Santa Claus turn into a shady company?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> That&#39;s impossible! Santa Claus is a friend to children everywhere!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> ...But it seems your story is true. As a fellow Santa, I am upset.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That Santa must be a fake.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> Come to think of it... Santa Alter&#39;s wearing black. I didn&#39;t realize that she was Santa Claus at first.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> But the other Santa looked just like you&#39;d expect Santa Claus to look.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Santa Alter is a good evil Santa Claus.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> Hmm. That&#39;s a complicated way of calling her. So, is she good or bad?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> ...A dark Santa, huh? One that gives awful presents to bad kids.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Kids might think she&#39;s a mean Santa, but objectively speaking, she punishes evil kids so they&#39;ll mend their ways.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> That&#39;s not true at all. I just give people the gifts they need.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> I have no intention on lecturing anyone. If you want one, you can ask an Avenger.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Anyway, I&#39;m sorry that happened to you. Let me see... I didn&#39;t expect to need presents for three people.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> You, cold-looking woman. This is for you. The real one isn&#39;t here, but if you have this with you you&#39;ll find it.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> A-A ship? I might be able to do something with a small boat, but a ship this large...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> Well, whatever... If I sneak aboard at night and take the boss out first, the crew will all belong to me.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> That&#39;s a dangerous thought. As expected from a genius dog like you. I can see why your brother has such trouble.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Next...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Huh? I get something too? You show compassion, even to those you fought?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> I&#39;m sorry. I misjudged you. You are pure-hearted, and a real Santa Claus\u2014</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> This is for you. You like these, right?</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Oh my.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> ...Wait a minute! I don&#39;t need this! Why would a Saint want to get buff?</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> Hey, what do I get? Don&#39;t I get a present?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Of course. You get this, Jean Kay.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> This talisman will help you do your job elegantly, and not panic in front of your target.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHA!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> She loved it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...She thinks it&#39;s funny?</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> Wonderful! I love this bearded guy\u2014! Wow. That kinda got me. That hit me right in the kokoro.</p><p><strong>Jing Ke:</strong> I&#39;m gonna go assassinate this guy\u2013! He&#39;s got a face that just makes you want to stab him from behind\u2014!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> He was already assassinated...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That&#39;s crazy...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> ...I&#39;m sorry. Jing Ke almost never gets drunk, but when she does she&#39;s like this...</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> She&#39;s been drinking ever since that Santa Claus got her... It&#39;s understandable.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Hmm... This Santa Claus was good enough to deceive tough-looking girls like you, huh?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Well, it doesn&#39;t matter. My job is done here.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Let&#39;s go, Fujimaru! To the next set of troubled children!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> They left, huh? She turned out to be a good Santa, but...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> Why was my Lord wearing a reindeer costume?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> No, it was very cute, so it was a good Christmas present for me.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Y-You think she&#39;s just into that? That&#39;s how Riders are. Anyway\u2014</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> ...I don&#39;t see Jing Ke, do you?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> Oh.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong> \u2014Okay, it&#39;s too late! Let&#39;s forget about the bearded gentleman!</p><h2 id="_4th-night-penname-daddy-long-legs" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_4th-night-penname-daddy-long-legs" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 4th Night: Penname, Daddy-Long-Legs</h2><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> The keel&#39;s done for! It&#39;ll break any moment now! Isn&#39;t it time a certain someone took responsibility for this mess?!</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Don&#39;t look at me! This isn&#39;t my fault! This whole thing was supposed to be the two of us going on a fishing trip!</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Being equally matched at hunting in the woods, we were supposed to take our contest to sea, so to speak. That&#39;s when\u2014</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> That&#39;s when\u2014 A certain idiot stowed away on our boat and waited for his chance while the two of us were busy in the hold.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> And saying how he wanted to meet the ladies of the Southern Lands, steered our boat straight out to sea!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Isn&#39;t that right?</p><p><strong>Emiya/Robin:</strong> \u201CKing David!\u201D \u201COld Man David!\u201D</p><p><strong>David:</strong> Hmm... It&#39;s one thing when young ladies call my name... But having it shouted by you gentlemen is rather unpleasant.</p><p><strong>David:</strong> Now, you two. Weren&#39;t you ever taught that you must respect your elders?</p><p><strong>David:</strong> By the way, I&#39;d rather like to return to the shore now. What do you say?</p><p><strong>David:</strong> What? The sail got broken and we ran out of our magical energy?</p><p><strong>David:</strong> Then this is an emergency! Quickly, you two! Jump into the water!</p><p><strong>David:</strong> The boat can still hold my weight if I&#39;m alone. The magical energy stored should hold out too! It&#39;s simple math!</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Arrrghh! It&#39;s no use, I am about to snap\u2014! Old man, how can you act so high and mighty at a time like this?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> That&#39;s how every one of the Kings of Old behaves! In fact, I can think of one who&#39;s like a walking mass of arrogance...</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Wah! This isn&#39;t the time to stand around glaring at each other! Let&#39;s hurry up and toss some cargo overboard, at least!</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> If we get done in by something like this, we&#39;ll be the laughingstock of the Servant World!</p><p><strong>David:</strong> The Servant World? So that&#39;s how you refer to it? That&#39;s good to know. Thank you!</p><p><strong>David:</strong> Then in that case, may I ask who the current top comedian is there? I&#39;d like to know for future reference.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Oh, probably that one girl... The one with the dragon wings and the horns growing out of her head.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> There are lots of other talented ones too, but they fall short of her.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> What are you babbling on about? As of now, I&#39;d nominate the three of us for the biggest stooges!</p><p><strong>David:</strong> Oh yes, I&#39;m sorry! That reminds me, do the two of you know the tale of Carneades?</p><p><strong>David:</strong> When a ship sank upon a stormy sea, one man was fortunate and survived the wreck by clinging to a small piece of driftwood.</p><p><strong>David:</strong> But there was another fortunate man who survived as well, and he swam toward the first man. Therein arose a problem.</p><p><strong>David:</strong> The driftwood was large enough to keep one man afloat, but with two, it would certainly sink. Thus, the man\u2014</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Hey, Red Mantle! What do you say we lighten our load by one person right now? Then you and I can continue our contest afterward!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> For once, I agree with you, huntsman!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> This is a good chance for us. We can compete to see who&#39;s the better Archer right here and now!</p><p><strong>David:</strong> That saddens me. Nothing ever comes from contention... And, it&#39;s already known that I am the superior Archer...</p><p><strong>David:</strong> But I suppose if I were to knock you off the boat defending myself, none could blame me for it. So I shall join in your contest!</p><p><strong>David:</strong> Despite my appearance, I was a King of many victories. I must warn you that I am skilled. Extremely skilled.</p><p><strong>David:</strong> If there were a ranking of \u201CMost-Victorious Kings\u201D in the Servant World, I assure you, I would occupy its top spot.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Oh, is that so? Fine by me. Killing kings is what I do, so I&#39;ll put you out of your misery now!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Most-Victorious King? Superior Archer? Hmph. You 3-Stars certainly talk a big game.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> !!! Look above!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Hohoho! Step aside, you&#39;re in the way of my landing!</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> ...And who might you be? We were in the middle of something just now, you know?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> The invincible Santa that descends upon Christmas like this storm! That is who I am.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Huh? Santa? Really? But wait! The sky? You came from the sky?</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Meaning, you have some means of getting off this boat?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Naturally, I do. Due to this storm, I have left my sleigh and reindeer waiting for me above the clouds.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> A proper Servant must think upon their Master&#39;s safety. Isn&#39;t that so, Red Archer?</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Oh-hoh! Is this Servant an acquaintance of yours, Red Mantle?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> \u2014(remains silent with an unreadable expression on his face)</p><p><strong>David:</strong> Abishag! It&#39;s you, Abishag! O Beautiful One, there can be no doubt that you are my Abishag!</p><p><strong>David:</strong> Ohh, to think that we would both become Servants and meet again like this! I am truly blessed!</p><p><strong>David:</strong> Come, warm this chilled body of mine as you did in the past. Come, hesitate not.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> You are mistaken, King David. I am Santa Alter, not Abishag.</p><p><strong>David:</strong> ??? But with beauty such as yours you must be Abishag. Ah. Perhaps you do not recognize me as a youth?</p><p><strong>David:</strong> I was an old man when I took you as my wife. But fear not, for my heart is as true as ever it was.</p><p><strong>David:</strong> Be I shepherd, king, or aged man, I declare that the contents of my mind, at base, are ever unchanged!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Oh? That is well, then. In that case, you were of sound mind when proclaiming yourself the \u201CMost-Victorious King\u201D?</p><p><strong>David:</strong> Huh? Uh, yes, I suppose that... I was indeed powerful in war.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> ...Fool... You&#39;ve dug your own grave...</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Then I shall see your strength tested. Gift distribution can wait till after.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> En garde, Archers! This sword shall rectify your arrogance!</p><p><strong>David:</strong> Sorry, one moment, please! As I, personally, am not terribly powerful, won&#39;t you assist me, gentlemen?</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Huh? Are you completely mad? All we want is to catch a ride on that flying sleigh...</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Though she just might do our bidding if we defeat her. If it&#39;s a fight you want, I will gladly comply.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> A Saber-class challenging Archer-class Servants to a fight. This won&#39;t even be funny.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Gwaah\u2014?! Man, I messed up... Now that I look closer, you&#39;re actually a Rider-class, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> You have an Archer who attacks with a staff. A Rider who attacks with a sack of presents should be fine as well.</p><p><strong>David:</strong> Hahaha! Well, there&#39;s no comeback we can make to that. That said, my Noble Phantasm is pretty Archer-like though.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> ...Ahem. I assume we&#39;re all calmed down now? Why, exactly, did you come here, Santa Rider?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Fool. I did not come here at my own behest. I came in response to a \u201CDear Santa\u201D letter.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> ...I see. I have a pretty good idea who the sender was. I&#39;ll bet he asked for jewels to delight his many wives with, right?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Really, writing letters to Santa as a full-grown man... What a problematic adult. Seriously.</p><p><strong>David:</strong> Yes, seriously problematic. One should limit one&#39;s childish dreams.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> What? King David... Um. Pardon me, but wasn&#39;t it you?</p><p><strong>David:</strong> Of course it wasn&#39;t. The only one I send my prayers to is our Lord in Heaven.</p><p><strong>David:</strong> And anyhow, isn&#39;t the idea of Santa Claus a bit scary? It&#39;s nothing but trouble to receive gifts from someone who wishes nothing in return.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> If it wasn&#39;t me and it wasn&#39;t King David, that means\u2014</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> All right, all right! It was me, okay? I sent it! Call it a temporary fit of madness\u2013!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Don&#39;t be embarrassed. All are equally accepted in the eyes of Santa Claus. Especially you in the green. You have worked hard.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Your method of supporting your Master from the shadows rather than coddling them is most praise-worthy. Though a tad under-handed.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> In contrast, you in the red. You spoil your Master too much. What are you, the mother of an exam student preparing for Exam Day?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Uh-uh! I object strongly to that! I&#39;m not at all overprotective...</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> These presents are for you two. Accept them gratefully.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> !!!! Black Key Assortments?</p><p><strong>David:</strong> Wow, what an impressive-looking sword! (rather half-heartedly)</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Don&#39;t get too happy yet. Your real present is being prepared elsewhere. I sent word ahead of time, so it should arrive soon.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Farewell, then. Keep your fights moderate during Christmas times!</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> She comes and goes like a storm. I didn&#39;t even realize the real storm had passed.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Ah, well. At least this means we won&#39;t have to listen to the tale of Carneades now.</p><p><strong>David:</strong> What? Who spoke of Carneades&#39; tale as an example to follow? That&#39;s horrendous. Let us put that man to death.</p><p><strong>Emiya/Robin:</strong> It was you! You haven&#39;t learned anything since the Uriah incident, have you?!</p><p><strong>David:</strong> Now, now. No matter how strained the situation, I am not the kind of man who would be so insensitive as that.</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> ...Maybe we really should just toss him overboard? We&#39;d be doing his Master a favor, don&#39;t you think?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> ...Agreed. His existence will only be a bad example. Let&#39;s just say King David went back to Okeanos.</p><p><strong>David:</strong> I apologize, it seems your words were true. I know I am wrong now, please forgive me. Our Lord in Heaven says so, too.</p><p><strong>David:</strong> Rather, why don&#39;t we reflect on our battle just now? Despite our loss, don&#39;t you think the three of us make a good team?</p><p><strong>David:</strong> Nameless One, with your AOE Noble Phantasm. And Faceless One, with his single-target Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>David:</strong> And I, using aggressive evasive tactics to avoid harm, sealing the enemy&#39;s special attacks before they are launched.</p><p><strong>David:</strong> Even humbly speaking, wouldn&#39;t we be a rather invincible team? We should become friends, shouldn&#39;t we?</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Hmm, that&#39;s true enough. We wouldn&#39;t have any blind spots as a team.</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> True. We wouldn&#39;t be the most powerful team, but we&#39;re all elite Archers. With the three of us combined, there&#39;d be no enemy who could\u2014</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Hi! I received your order and have come accordingly! This is the location of the special Christmas concert, right?</p><p><strong>Emiya:</strong> Ugh, a Lancer?!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> According to the client&#39;s order, since we are floating out at sea, I can let loose and sing as loud as I want...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> I won&#39;t let anyone escape me tonight! Now let&#39;s jump straight into my opening number, \u201CLove is Dracul!\u201D</p><p><strong>Robin:</strong> Ah, this is the end. We&#39;re all going to the underworld with that AOE Noble Phantasm...</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> It seems the Home-Delivered Concert from Hell has begun.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Heh! Those accursed Archers, will drop like flies.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Welcome back, Santa.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Th-thank you. So you&#39;ve learned to give Santa a proper greeting after all? You seem to be understanding your role as a reindeer better.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Did something happen down there at all?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> What? I merely sent them an event worthy of Christmas.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> After all, they were wondering who the top comedian in the Servant World was at present.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> In any case, that concludes our detour. Our next \u201CDear Santa\u201D letter\u2014</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> ...comes from Uruk, from a boy named Gilgamesh?!</p><h2 id="_5th-night-little-gilgamesh" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_5th-night-little-gilgamesh" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 5th Night: Little Gilgamesh</h2><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> This is the address of our next letter-sender, but\u2014</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> My letter should be arriving soon. Not that I normally take any notice of Christmas or whatever it is\u2014</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> That wretched Saber is sure to dress in that manner of getup. Such frivolity... Who would&#39;ve thought she would answer to such needs so faithfully.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> It is praise-worthy for a king to endeavor to meet his subjects&#39; expectations. Even I could perhaps learn from her example. But of course, I won&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> No, that is not the vital point in this. What I should truly take note of is the institution of Christmas!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> It is said that however reserved and modest a woman can be, on Christmas, she cannot help but speak the truth of her heart!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> Ahh, I can&#39;t imagine any future but one in which she will confess her feelings for me! Very well. I shall allow it! Thank me for the good service!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> Now, come quickly, Dark Santa! I shall make you understand our difference through my treasury!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> Fwahahaha! And then, perhaps I will say something like, \u201CYou, yourself, are my Christmas present, aren&#39;t you?\u201D</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> We&#39;re leaving, Fujimaru. This house appears to be empty.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yes, indeed.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Yes, indeed.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Reindeer! We have the night off thanks to Gilgamesh&#39;s grand delusions.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> And we happen to be floating above a great city. What don&#39;t we enjoy ourselves in its entertainment quarter?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Though there are but rustic eateries here in ancient Uruk, they should have good, simple food to dine upon.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> I, myself, favor that dish of wheat flour mixed with water and stuffed with various fillings that is then baked upon an iron plate and then basted with sauce afterward.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong></p><p>I imagine even you could make something like th\u2014 What?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> We&#39;ve been encapsulated by a strange space! Don&#39;t leave my side, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> !!! ...Where are we? This does not appear to be a normal place...</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> ...Pardon me... Hello there. Miss, are you Santa Claus?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> You are Santa, aren&#39;t you? I mean, you&#39;re carrying all those presents, after all.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Yes, I am Santa. And what manner of beings are you? Are you the ghosts that haunt this place?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> We...are not ghosts or phantoms, I think... But I don&#39;t think we are human either...</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> Yes... Neither Jack nor I really know what we are...</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> We didn&#39;t have names either... All we could do is lie here and look at the town...</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> But tonight, um...</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Since it&#39;s...Christmas... We were thinking we&#39;d like something warm too.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> ...Yeah. That&#39;s why, even though we knew that it was wrong...</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> ...we forcefully summoned you here \u201Cinside\u201D ourselves.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> ...I see. You must be the unfulfilled spirits of young girls. Your lives ended while still innocent, and ignorant of love.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> I see you&#39;ve gained a sense of self under the light of Christmas. ...Though only due to your sense of loneliness.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> We aren&#39;t that complicated. But Alice only had memories of the hospital, so...</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> What? Well, you only had memories of a dark sewer, Jack. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a good thing. Not at all.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> That&#39;s why... At least for one day today, we... We wanted to feel \u201Cchosen\u201D by someone too...</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> ...I see. So you&#39;ve never had your names called, or have never been chosen by another?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> \u2014Upon this extraordinary day, the two of you felt that you, alone, were not special?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> This sounds like a job for Santa Alter.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Aren&#39;t you going to give them presents?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> That I cannot do. I cannot give presents to any who have not written me letters.</p><p><strong>Jack/Nursery Rhyme:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> However! If you wish it from the bottom of your heart, declare it! Wanting something just because you&#39;re lonely means nothing!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> You should want something because it looks like fun, or simply because you want it! There, now. Show some courage!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> O\u2014Okay. T-to be honest, we...</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> We want to play like everyone else does! We want a dream that&#39;s more fun than this!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> Please, Santa Claus! Please give us presents too!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Well spoken. I shall answer to this courage. If you have no letter, then come take your presents by force!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Apologies for keeping you waiting, little ones. Now, let us begin this merry party!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Jack/Nursery Rhyme:</strong> Aww... We...lost... I guess there won&#39;t be...any Christmas for us...</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Augh\u2014! I\u2013have\u2013been\u2013defeated\u2014!</p><p><strong>Jack/Nursery Rhyme:</strong> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Well fought, my brave little ones! As promised, I shall now give you Christmas presents!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> Ms. Santa!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Ah... Ohh... Presents... So many presents!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Santa!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Your face says, \u201CSo you do have some good points,\u201D Fujimaru. ...Of course, I do. I am the ally of all children.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Alter-chan!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Do not call me, \u201CAlter-chan!\u201D Know your place as a reindeer and show some restraint!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> Thank you... Thank you, Santa Claus! But is it really okay for us to have so many presents\u2014?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Th-that&#39;s right... Aren&#39;t there many other children waiting for their presents too?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Heh. You needn&#39;t worry about that. I have only one more stop to make.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> What&#39;s more, these are merely the spoils of your victorious battle. Now, what shall I give you for your actual, individual presents\u2014?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Here, take this! These are the presents I have chosen especially for you!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Ohh... Ohhhh\u2014! This... This is...</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> Hurray\u2014! It&#39;s a reindeer\u2014! A humongous, humongous reindeer\u2014!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Two little girls running in gleeful circles around Asterios... Heh! That&#39;s what a proper Christmas should be.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...So you already had a reindeer,</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Fool, that one is only for show. If Asterios were to start running, lightning would streak the sky.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Which would frighten all the little children. The best thing for this prince is to have him do nothing.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Should we go call Euryale?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Certainly not. If that wicked goddess were here, she would turn these pure, young girls into demons!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> ...In any case, our work here is done. Even if it is only a dream for one night, enjoy yourselves heartily.</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> Ah... Wait, Santa!</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> ...Thank you. Never mind me, but thank you for granting Alice&#39;s wish.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> Yes, thank you, Santa, and thank you, Jack. Even though I was scared at first, the party was fun!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> \u2014</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> But I&#39;m glad. It was only because we waited patiently like the fake Santa told us to...</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> ...that we got to meet the real Santa Claus.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> \u2014Wait. What do you speak of?</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> ...Right. Before you came here, another Santa Claus came too. But...</p><p><strong>Jack:</strong> ...while that Santa was talking with us, they suddenly said, \u201CUh-oh. This won&#39;t do!\u201D</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> \u201CSince I&#39;m not the real Santa Claus, I won&#39;t be able to fulfill your wishes. But the real Santa Claus is sure to show up soon.\u201D</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> \u201CPlease be good girls and wait patiently until then. What? If you can&#39;t do that, I&#39;ll try to do something for you next year.\u201D</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> And after saying that, that Santa disappeared somewhere. She may have been a fake, but she was a cool Santa too!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> Well, good-bye, Santa! And Santa&#39;s reindeer! Thank you for bringing presents all the way out here!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> ...A fake Santa. I&#39;d been ignoring it, but now it seems a showdown is inevitable.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Before I deliver my final present, I must punish this insolent cur. Fujimaru, next up - a showdown!</p><h2 id="_6th-night-fake-santa-caesar" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_6th-night-fake-santa-caesar" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 6th Night: Fake Santa, Caesar</h2><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Welcome to the snowy fields of the final showdown! Of course, I was the fake Santa!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> \u2014(Tired Sigh)</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> W-What&#39;s with that sigh? A duel in a blizzard should be incredibly exciting!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Now, let me answer all your questions! I&#39;m ready!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Why did I become Santa Claus? Why is Caesar so plump?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> What kind of beauty was Cleopatra? What&#39;s the present going to be on the last day?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Everything! Everything! My swift tongue shall melt away all your anger and doubts!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Shut up, you red igloo! I&#39;ve no interest in your babbling!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Igloo? Oh, those houses they make out of snow. I stand strong against adversity, so it&#39;s a good metaphor.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> But are you sure you can&#39;t wait just a little? Don&#39;t you want to know the story?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> No, you should learn the whole thing! It was on a starry night, when I went to Darius&#39; castle.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> He mistook me for Santa Claus, and became very happy. I had no choice but to take his things.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That makes no sense!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Why didn&#39;t you have a choice?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Am I supposed to tell someone who&#39;s overjoyed to see Santa that they&#39;ve got the wrong guy?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> I could do not that, for I am Caesar. But I had no presents to give out.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> So I borrowed things from Darius. So I could use them as presents, you see.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Though I did have Phantom, who just happened to be there, sign off as the buyer.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Are you a demon!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What did Phantom ever do to you?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> But in the end, I was just a temporary Santa Claus. I couldn&#39;t give them what they truly wanted.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Unable to bear their sad crying, I crossed the river and the next thing I knew I was in France.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> There was a very pure-hearted knight. She... No, he? No, She? Anyway, I did my work there, too.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> I heard they wished to sell their old possessions and I bought everything they owned.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> I was fortunate to have the funds from Darius. One of their possessions was a treasure of the French Royal family.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> They begged me to return it, so I sold it back to them for ten times the price.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> \u201CAre you really a famous spy, d&#39;Eon? Maybe the enemy just lets you go because you&#39;re cute?\u201D</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> I couldn&#39;t bear to see the Queen bullying her like that. She was almost in tears.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> So I went to the mountains and hid, where I found an oriental beauty plotting to assassinate an Emperor.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> \u201CThis time, the Emperor shall die by my hand\u2014\u201D</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Could any man not be struck by the sight of her meditating beneath that waterfall?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Fortunately, I&#39;m half an emperor myself. I told her I could give her good advice, and persuaded her to lend me her daggers\u2014</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Enough! Silence! You&#39;re a walking fraud machine!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Humph. I&#39;m a victim too, you know.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Everywhere I go, people call me Santa Claus!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> I&#39;m a general and a politician. You could say it&#39;s my job to live up to people&#39;s expectations.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Thus, even if I knew I was fake, I had no choice but to play the role. Though I did have fun.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> By the way, do you know why they all think I&#39;m Santa Claus? I have no idea.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I mean, you look just like...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Surprised you survived this far, actually.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> ...I see. I&#39;m forcing myself to wear this embarrassing outfit, yet you don&#39;t have to do anything for children to love you...</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> I have no choice but to kill you! For the sake of the world, and Santa Claus!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Hahaha! That&#39;s the true Santa Claus for you!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> To be honest, I was getting tired of being mistaken for Santa Claus and having to run away!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Then stop causing trouble!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You can&#39;t live without making trouble, huh?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> I&#39;m bored, though! Nero and Caligula won&#39;t play with me!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> And Cleopatra is avoiding me! How can I be Caesar if I don&#39;t cause trouble for all these lovey-dovey couples!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So you just have a grudge against people!?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Hahahaha! I guess you found me out! It&#39;s time to fight, then!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> If I defeat you, I will take the presents, and become the True Santa, that&#39;s fine with me!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> The throne of the rare Servant shall be mine! Now hand it over, Dark Santa!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Humph... The wind...stopped... Is this the end...of my battle?</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> But...it&#39;s not so bad... It was hard for me, too... After falling at the hands of the true Santa, I can finally...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Mr. Caesar...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Mr. Igloo...</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> \u2014Humph.</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Jump! Hahaha! That was close! The snow is so slippery!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> He moves around so fast... He&#39;s like a seal on ice!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> I&#39;d prefer you called me a dancing snowman. Hmm, but I can&#39;t stop. I can&#39;t stop!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> My plan to take over the role of protagonist and grab the star of glory is ruined!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> But this is for the best!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> The star of the festival should be a beautiful Servant, not someone like me!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Farewell Dark Santa! Farewell Reindeer! The Christmas nights are at an end, and the 25th is upon us soon!</p><p><strong>Caesar:</strong> Gather stockings, and a Christmas Eve miracle shall be yours!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> ...He rolled all the way home, huh? We won&#39;t be able to catch him.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> But this solves the problem. The fake Santa is gone and will never deceive people again.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I don&#39;t think we&#39;re done with Caesar...</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> ...True. To be honest, when I heard \u201Cfake,\u201D I was imagining a different Roman emperor.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> There&#39;s another Red Saber... Someday, I&#39;ll have to settle things with her.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> A Christmas Eve Miracle?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> I-I wouldn&#39;t know. Forget it. It&#39;s for your own good.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Fujimaru, there&#39;s one night left. There&#39;s still one Dear Santa letter.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> I look forward to finding out what kind of child awaits us.</p><h2 id="_7th-night-attack-the-alter-next-door" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_7th-night-attack-the-alter-next-door" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 7th Night: Attack! The Alter Next Door</h2><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> At last, it&#39;s time, Fujimaru. Tonight shall be our last and greatest work.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> The last \u201CDear Santa\u201D letter is from an Alter, address unknown.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> An evil Servant, crawling in the abyss of a curse... In other words, like me.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Her present request is for \u201CA board game everyone can have fun playing together.\u201D</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> It&#39;s a game like the Japanese sugoroku, where you roll the dice to advance your piece, and buy up properties on a game board.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> The players buy land, charging tolls and usage fees to strip the other players of their fortunes and become rich.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> There are many ways to clear the game, but the most common is to reach a certain amount, or bankrupt all the other players.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Below us is a Servant who would desire such a game. Exciting, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Let&#39;s go. Don&#39;t forget to smile. Don&#39;t forget to pray. Don&#39;t forget to be sadistic.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> As Evil Santa Claus, it&#39;s time for me to perform my last job!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> I have arrived! Santa Clause descends to the sound of jingling bells!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> \u2014This is awful. This is the worst. The worst possible woman who could&#39;ve come.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Jeanne d&#39;Arc Alter?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> I thought it was just that disgusting Servant, but you&#39;re here too, huh Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> What does a pure-hearted Master want with a fallen woman like me?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> L-Lovely Christmas decorations!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> How? What part of all this is luxurious?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> The spirits did this on their own. It&#39;s not my taste. I would&#39;ve used a burning stake motif.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Or what? Will you be my straw doll Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> A straw doll, crucified and burning. I like that. It&#39;s enticing.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> If you will, I&#39;ll forget about what happened before. It won&#39;t matter, because you&#39;ll be dead!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Don&#39;t you dare bite my Master, rabid dog. You&#39;re the one who sent me a letter.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Heh\u2014I was shocked when I saw the name on the envelope. A girl who&#39;s nothing but hatred towards what is good, making a wish?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Also, the handwriting was very easy to read. I thought you couldn&#39;t write.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> I studied! Is that bad!? Those scribblings I made were so ugly it made me retch.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Heh. That&#39;s just like you, getting rid of anything you don&#39;t like.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> And why does it matter if they&#39;re ugly? No one will see them.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Humph. You&#39;re not thinking hard enough. I&#39;m a perfectionist. You know, if you sign a contract with bad handwriting\u2014</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...Enough about that.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Why are you calling yourself Santa? Bring out the real Santa.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Are you blind? Or just stupid? I&#39;ve brought many presents to children.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> I may not be a Saint, but I&#39;m a real Santa Claus. Fujimaru&#39;s trust is proof of that.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> The reason I started this was to fling this present in your face, but now this is my real job.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> I can&#39;t be a Saint, but I&#39;m not a fake. Right, my Reindeer?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Santa Alter is a real Santa Claus.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Indeed. You may deny my words, but not those of Fujimaru. Right, Dark Jeanne?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Santa Alter is a veteran Santa.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> I don&#39;t know if there are veteran Santas. But maybe you&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Hah\u2014 I see. This is an elaborate way of pranking me, huh?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> You probably thought I was spending Christmas lonely by myself, right?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> But too bad! I&#39;m having fun every day!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> I&#39;ve got so many wonderful friends here with me!</p><p><strong>Pierres A to G:</strong> \u201CHelp me!\u201D \u201CHelp me!\u201D \u201CHelp me!\u201D \u201CHelp me!\u201D \u201CHelp me!\u201D \u201CHelp me!\u201D</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> A horde of spirits? You haven&#39;t been using them to\u2014</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> That&#39;s right! We&#39;re all having fun playing a board game! Games are fun! Games are great!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> The weak endlessly trod the path of the weak, and the strong endlessly take from the weak\u2014</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Stealing the flesh and blood off the other players as they scream and cry is wonderful.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Yes\u2014 I am in first place by far! I have the most capital! Monopoly is fun! Monopoly is great!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Hmm? It doesn&#39;t seem like that much of a difference... There&#39;s about a 10,000 dollar difference between 1st and 2nd place\u2014</p><p><strong>Pierre D:</strong> \u201CHelp me!\u201D</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> !</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> He just took the lead.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...Jeanne owes Pierre a million dollars...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Oh, I&#39;m sorry. My hand slipped. Let&#39;s start over. Too bad!</p><p><strong>Pierre D:</strong> \u201CHelp me!\u201D</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> ...How wicked. You haven&#39;t repented at all, have you?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> You&#39;ll never make any friends like this, and you definitely won&#39;t get to be a Servant.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Humph. I don&#39;t want to be a Servant.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> I don&#39;t need a Master. Why would I want to join you, anyway?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...I&#39;m fine being alone. I&#39;m fine being alone. I should atone for my sins all by myself.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> I don&#39;t want anyone&#39;s help\u2014least of all the help of Fujimaru, the one who defeated me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Jeanne Alter...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Oh, are you sympathetic? Or disgusted? It doesn&#39;t matter. You&#39;re annoying me anyway.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You need to play the game fair, though...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> How rude. I play fair! Wait, is that what you&#39;re thinking about here!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> I just used Jeanne Rule #3: Jeanne gets to do whatever she wants three times!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> I guess nothing we say matters... We&#39;ll have to fight.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> That&#39;s just what I want. Pierres, get ready. You want to work off some of that stress, right?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Torture them. Just like the trials you gave to me in life! Torture them slowly!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Humph, by the way... I&#39;ve been wondering, but did you forget how to talk like a Saint?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Oh, I haven&#39;t forgotten. This is just for today. I mean, you wouldn&#39;t want me using fancy words, right?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Can&#39;t you tell? I&#39;m trying to match you. I&#39;m trying to use words your puny, violent brain will understand!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> It must be hard. I understand your pain. I recognize your frustration myself.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Because I was trying to match your level, and it&#39;s been making me want to throw up.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So you&#39;re both good friends!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You&#39;re both Alter!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter/Jeanne Alter:</strong> Would you shut up!?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Humph. I guess that&#39;s all you can expect out of spirits. The only ones I can rely on are Gilles and the wyverns.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> So, what will you do? Keep playing?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> I spend my days doing nothing but cursing at the bottom of the Earth. I&#39;ll fight as much as you like.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> She hasn&#39;t changed at all...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> She hasn&#39;t learned a thing!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> That&#39;s right, Fujimaru. The battle will continue until we defeat her mentally.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Losing won&#39;t teach her anything. She&#39;ll just try and claim we never won.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> This particular child needs an especially nasty punishment.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...What? Do you have some kind of trump card?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Of course. Will you still talk about staying down here forever after you get this present?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> \u2014</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Oh, her expression changed.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Yeah, I kind of know how you feel.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> How does it feel to look at your light... Light? Well, I guess it&#39;s light.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> This is what will happen if you stay down here. At this rate, there might even be Jeanne Lily.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> \u2014I&#39;m going back to purgatory. I&#39;ve got better things to do than play here.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> I&#39;ll build up my Spirit Origin and become a Servant, and next time I&#39;ll impale that stupid wannabe Saint!</p><p><strong>Pierres:</strong> \u201COooh!\u201D \u201CWe&#39;re free!\u201D \u201CWe&#39;re free!\u201D \u201CWe&#39;re saved!\u201D \u201CThank you!\u201D \u201CThank you!\u201D</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Oh, but first, I forgot something.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Let&#39;s go, Bishop. You&#39;re going to help me with my trials in purgatory, okay?</p><p><strong>Pierres:</strong> \u201CHelp me!\u201D \u201CHelp me!\u201D \u201CHelp me!\u201D \u201CHelp me!\u201D \u201CHelp me!\u201D \u201CHelp me!\u201D</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> ...All right. That&#39;s the last of the Dear Santa letters. We&#39;ve handed out all the presents.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> My job is done. Good work, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> I couldn&#39;t have finished this without you.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Without you, I would&#39;ve given up after the first person.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> ...I may not look it, but I get bored easily and have a short temper. I&#39;m sure you didn&#39;t notice.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Oh, yeah.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Sure, yeah.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> I like that. It&#39;s good for a Master to be able to get along with their Servants.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> ...Hmm. So even that&#39;s not enough to get my point across, huh? Fine. Get on your knees and lower your head.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> I will point my sword at your shoulders, but I won&#39;t cut you. Just bear it for a moment.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> \u2014Once again, I recognize you, Fujimaru. I won&#39;t forget what has happened over these last 10 days.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> You are my knight, my follower, and my leader.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Please keep your light shining into the future.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> ...Now then, the time has come, it seems. Our busy Christmas is over.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> I have one final present for you. A justly deserved reward. Take it.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> ...In other words, a new fighter. I don&#39;t need to say anything more, do I?</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Chaldea&#39;s system has its flaws, so you&#39;ll have to start over from scratch. But that&#39;s all right.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Thanks to its flaws, and its vagueness, so many encounters are possible. It&#39;s a good thing.</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> My blade is with you! You can ride on my sleigh any time you want!</p><p><strong>Santa Alter:</strong> Farewell, my Master! \u2014Merry Christmas!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Doctor, it&#39;s Senpai! They suddenly appeared in an unoccupied bathroom!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> What\u2014! Did that bathroom have a hidden room or something?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> My head feels... Weird...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I think I saw... Santa...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Good, you seem like you&#39;re okay. Oh, but this is\u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai is REM-REM-ing and looking very tired.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Is that right? Long-term Rayshifts are mentally draining, so it&#39;s good to get a lot of sleep, but...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Oh, their health looks okay.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I was worried when you grabbed me and told me Chaldea was in trouble. I&#39;m glad it was nothing.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> And disappearing only to reappear later is quite the Prestige! It&#39;ll be a great trick for the party!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Party?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Wait, is today</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, it&#39;s Christmas, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Everyone&#39;s waiting for you in the conference room, Christmas cake in hand.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Master? Is something bothering you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Nah. I&#39;ve got a funny story to tell you later.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I look forward to that. I was a little worried it would just be Da Vinci&#39;s magic tricks.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> There are only a few days left in the year. Our battle continues, but for tonight, let&#39;s enjoy Christmas!</p><p>\uFFFD</p>',868),s=[a];function i(h,g){return e(),o("div",null,s)}var l=t(r,[["render",i],["__file","christmas1.html.vue"]]);export{l as default};
