I know it&#39;s sudden, but let&#39;s train.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Why?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> For what...</p><hr><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong> You&#39;re a mage. So perhaps you think physical strengthening is unnecessary.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong> However, such notions may prove to be fatal.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong> As the battles get fiercer and deadlier, it&#39;s essential to fortify your body.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong> You must improve your strength and endurance! Relax, my calculations are flawless!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I feel even more nervous now...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;m not so sure about that...</p><hr><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong> Yes, just leave everything to me! Come on, let&#39;s be off.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We have arrived.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This is a mock battlefield. Um...Senpai, are you sure about this?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong> As long as I, Leonidas, am by your side, there&#39;s nothing to fear!</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong> Let&#39;s start training!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong> You&#39;re working up a good sweat, I see. Let&#39;s continue!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> OK. I will summon your next opponent.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong> Bring it on!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Hmm, something&#39;s not right.Let&#39;s see\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Wh-What&#39;s going on\u2013?</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong> Ah. Rejoice, Master!</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong> It seems like our latest arrival is literally brimming with muscles!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m supposed to be happy about that?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That&#39;s nothing to &quot;rejoice&quot; about!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Th-There&#39;s been a malfunction!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We seem to have accidentally summoned something that we shouldn&#39;t have!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master, retreat immediately!</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong> What a silly suggestion! This is the perfect chance!</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong> Come on, Master...let&#39;s muscle through this!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong> Ah, what a fine battle!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> All adjustments complete. The final enemy has been set.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What do you want to do?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I think it&#39;s fair to conclude that training is over for today...</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong> Not yet! We must follow this through to the end. On to the next enemy!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Understood. The final opponent is a random enemy.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong> ...Um, Miss Mash. Just what is that, exactly?</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong> Is it that, uh, you know. I think it starts with a &quot;G.&quot;</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, it&#39;s a Ghost-type enemy.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong> ...Ghost...collective consciousness...science!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Leonidas? You seem to be sweating quite a lot...</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong> What? No, not at all! I&#39;m doing fine here. Just fine.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong> You might not think so, but I once took on 100,000 men! A mere spirit devoid of muscles is nothing to fear\u2013</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong> I apologize, Master! I confess I don&#39;t know how to deal with ghosts!</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong> You see, my muscles are useless against them\u2013! They seem smarter than me!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Let&#39;s overcome it.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong> Overcome it ...you say?</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong> U-Uh, I suppose it&#39;s not hard to say we won&#39;t run into ghost again in the future.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong> Thus, I must stand my ground! Fear not, Leonidas!</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong> This enemy&#39;s nothing compared to a Persian army of 100,000 men!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Don&#39;t worry. Your attacks will work.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong> What! ...I see, you may be right.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong> Indeed, even these ghosts were once human! Thus, my muscles are not useless after all!</p><hr><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong> Very well, Master! Let us face this ghost!</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong> Raaaaargh! We are ghost hunters!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong> Huff, huff, huff...</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong> What a powerful enemy...Contact with a ghost chills you to the bone. I just learned something...</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong> Thank you, Master! I was able to overcome the ghost with your help.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong> I swear to safeguard you from all enemies, to stave off despair, and to always bring you victory!</p>',77),a=[r];function i(g,p){return s(),t("div",null,a)}var u=o(n,[["render",i],["__file","Leonidas I.html.vue"]]);export{u as default};
