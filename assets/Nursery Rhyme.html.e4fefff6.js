The Soho area of London.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> The old bookstore, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Where Andersen was, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, Senpai. It&#39;s very similar to the 2nd floor of that bookstore.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;m sure it is. That&#39;s because your current location\u2013</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Is inside Nursery Rhyme&#39;s Reality Marble.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Although slightly different if we were to be technical. It&#39;s a subtype of the dream shared by Master and the contracted Servants.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Anyway, it&#39;s a special place. A special place involving the Servant Nursery Rhyme.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Understood, Doctor. I came up with a similar theory.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Because she&#39;s here.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> \u2014</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Why this form, I wonder?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> She&#39;s back to being a book.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. When you performed the second Ascension, she gained the form of a young girl.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So why has she regressed to her original form?</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> \u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> She doesn&#39;t speak, either. This is\u2013</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fooou!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Uh-oh! I&#39;m detecting magical energy in your vicinity! It looks like her, but it&#39;s not!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> They&#39;re trying to surround you, which means they&#39;re probably enemies!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Prepare for combat!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Roger, Master! Give me your orders!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Enemies defeated. ...She helped us.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Which means that, yup, Nursery Rhyme accepts Fujimaru as her Master.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> \u2014</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> She&#39;s a book, so she doesn&#39;t talk, though. What is happening, exactly?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Keep looking into it, Doctor. It appears we&#39;ve got more enemies approaching.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai, give me your orders. The battle continues!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fooou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Battle is over. We&#39;ve defeated them. Good work, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;m not getting anywhere with my analysis, but I have news. There&#39;s something very similar to Nursery Rhyme nearby.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> That army of books was similar to her, but this is more like an exact copy.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> This might be what pulled you into that space. Can you try talking to it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Roger!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Nothing else to do anyway</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Okay, Senpai. Let&#39;s move\u2013You too, Nursery Rhyme.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> \u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, when you move, she follows you, huh?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> That book&#39;s really attached. That&#39;s really...rather nice...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yeah. It feels like watching a cute little animal.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Is that...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Seems like it&#39;s up ahead. I can feel the response.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Here it comes. Looks like it&#39;s approaching. It might be an enemy, so be careful!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme?:</strong> \u2013Hello, the other me.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme?:</strong> I missed you, book me! Emotions folded in-between the pages.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme?:</strong> I missed you, real me! The me who can do nothing without fingers to flip the pages.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme?:</strong> I am me, Alice. You are me, a story.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme?:</strong> No, no. I am me. I&#39;m not Alice. You stay in that form, okay?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Alice?</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> \u2014</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Two Nursery Rhymes?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What&#39;s going on?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I don&#39;t know, exactly...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But the one that&#39;s connected to you by contract is the one that&#39;s a book.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But at the same time... That girl over there...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> She doesn&#39;t seem to be a fake Nursery Rhyme. Her magical energy feels too similar.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I got a detailed analysis now that you&#39;re closer\u2013 Yup, Mash is right. Their magical energy response is identical.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It&#39;s too identical. Like another copy of the same being?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I want to say that&#39;s impossible, but where you are, in a way, is inside Nursery Rhyme.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It&#39;s possible that her core is split into two beings!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> In other words?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Dumb it down for me!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> They&#39;re both her. It&#39;s a possibility.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> \u2014Correct.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (It talked!)</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> (Fou!)</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> \u2014That&#39;s me. The other me.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> \u2014The me in Alice&#39;s form.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> \u2014The Alice that shouldn&#39;t exist \u2014Because I imitated that form.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> \u2014I thought to myself. \u2014That form is Alice&#39;s, but...</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> \u2014Is it okay for me to take it? \u2014Can I be Alice when there is no Alice here?</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme?:</strong> No, no, no. It&#39;s wrong! I am just a story, right?</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme?:</strong> Alice isn&#39;t here! Only I&#39;m here!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme?:</strong> I must stay a story. I can&#39;t stay as Alice.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme?:</strong> Right\u2013?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ??</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...I see! So that&#39;s it! Nursery Rhyme isn&#39;t supposed to have a human form!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> But the Ascension gave her the form of a little girl. That self-contradiction grew within her.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> So she called Fujimaru, her Master, deep inside her.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> She&#39;s trying to get an answer, isn&#39;t she? About which form she should choose.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The book Nursery Rhyme is uncertain. The girl Nursery Rhyme wants to reject it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Let&#39;s ask her.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It&#39;s her choice.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s right, Senpai. ...Nursery Rhyme, the answer is within you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We can&#39;t answer for you. We don&#39;t know what that girl&#39;s form means to you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We don&#39;t know why you&#39;re hesitating. Or who or what you&#39;re thinking of.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So...</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> \u2014I am me. I know that.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> \u2014But I want to be Alice. \u2014I want that form, if I can have it.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> \u2014I want to drink sweet, sweet tea as Alice. \u2014I want to eat sweet, sweet candy as Alice.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> \u2014I want to play, as Alice.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> ...That was what Alice longed to do, ...when she held me in her arms until the very end.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Senpai.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> There&#39;s your answer.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Right, Master!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme?:</strong> I see. So that was my decision. But I won&#39;t allow it!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme?:</strong> I am me. Alice isn&#39;t here! I won&#39;t let you pretend this is a happy ending!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Magical energy response expanding! Here she comes!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Enemy unit defeated.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme?:</strong> Hmph. Actually, I knew how this was going to end. If Alice isn&#39;t here\u2013</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme?:</strong> I can just become Alice. That&#39;s the kind of dumb idea I&#39;d get now.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme?:</strong> Listen, me. If you&#39;re going to choose Alice&#39;s form...</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme?:</strong> Never...let your... story have...</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme?:</strong> an unhappy ending...</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> \u2014Yeah.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> I&#39;ll make it a happy ending. I&#39;ll do my best for Alice.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fooou!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Okay, I guess we&#39;re done! That weird space is closing, I think, so yeah!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;ll use the Rayshift technology to get you back to Chaldea.
