Any trace of humanity had been erased.</p><p>We no longer had any hope for survival, let alone of turning the tide. Nothing we tried had even the slightest effect.</p><p>In this wasteland, I searched through old records like a raccoon pawing through garbage.</p><p>I managed to find an old motorcycle, with barely enough fuel for a one-way trip, and began riding across the blinding white wasteland.</p><p>It&#39;s just...nothing about this makes sense. There are so many unanswered questions. If I&#39;m going to die, I at least want to know why.</p><p>I can accept an alien invasion. I can even accept the end of the world.</p><p>But I can&#39;t accept not knowing WHY they invaded us, or HOW.</p><p>The invasion lasted a good ninety days. There must have been SOME sign leading up to it. Someone must have seen this coming.</p><p>Or, maybe...someone knew this was coming, and decided to LET it happen.</p><p>How did the invaders first make their way to Earth to begin with?</p><p>Someone needs to figure at least that much out, or humanity will never be able to rest in peace.</p><p>So I&#39;ll keep exploring until I find a lead–some sort of clue that could lead me to the answers I seek.</p><p>This recording might just be me talking to myself...but still, there&#39;s every chance that this is the last document remaining on Earth.</p><p>My name is David. David Bluebook.</p><p>I&#39;m an oddball setting off on the last trip of his life, searching for answers in a world where I&#39;ll be lucky to see tomorrow.</p><h2 id="researcher-s-log-2016" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#researcher-s-log-2016" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Researcher&#39;s Log, 2016:</h2><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/JSdlr1m.png" alt=""></p><p>Eighteen hours have passed since the events we observed in New Mexico.

It won&#39;t be long now before I arrive at my destination in southern Nevada.</p><p>Not that it&#39;ll change anything once I get there.</p><p>I certainly won&#39;t be getting a reward for my trouble.</p><p>Nor do I have a home to return to, or enough fuel to get me there even if I did.</p><p>The only point this journey ever had was to get where I was going.</p><p>...Well, no, that may be technically accurate, but it&#39;s still not quite right. Let me be clear, so I don&#39;t invite any misunderstandings.</p><p>When I say I don&#39;t have a home to return to, I don&#39;t mean that in the heartless, cold-blooded bastard sense.</p><p>My home may be gone now, but I still remember it clearly. And as long as I have those memories, I&#39;ll never feel the pain of its loss.</p><p>See, since I was born, I&#39;ve had the ability, for better or worse, to recall anything I&#39;ve ever seen in perfect detail.</p><p>It&#39;s called, “hyperthymesia,” though it&#39;s more commonly known as a superior autobiographical memory.</p><p>My friends considered it a disability, and sympathized with the drawbacks, but scientists considered it a gift.</p><p>It drove me insane when I was a kid. At some points, it caused me to hate cities and people in general.</p><p>When I grew up, I left the city behind and started living a much quieter life out in a village near the mountains.</p><p>As a result, I&#39;ve only spent about a third of my life in busy, urban areas, so I&#39;m not really overburdened with memories of those places.</p><p>Still, my memories are just as clear now as they ever were. I can see the friends I used to hang out with smiling and laughing as if they were right here with me.</p><p>Of course, that includes the beautiful scenery and the stars that used to twinkle bright all across the nighttime sky.</p><p>...Maybe that&#39;s why I couldn&#39;t shake my doubts about why this happened the way it did.</p><p>Something just seemed...off.</p><p>I don&#39;t mean the Earth&#39;s surface being bleached white. I mean it feels like something even bigger has changed, but in a way I can&#39;t put my finger on it.</p><p>Whatever it is, I&#39;ve noticed it at different points during this journey.</p><p>There was something different about the skies above Russia, Scandinavia, China, India... Whatever it was, they weren&#39;t the same skies I&#39;d seen before.</p><p>There must be some other change occurring in places I&#39;m not privy to.

It&#39;s the one place–the only part of the texture–on the entire planet that managed to evade the bleaching.</p><p>The sheer secrecy surrounding this place led to all sorts of rumors about high-tech experiments and training being conducted here, but you&#39;d never know that looking at it now.</p><p>Not only are there no survivors here, there&#39;s not so much as a single piece of cutting-edge equipment.</p><p>Any seaplanes and armored tanks that may have been here before are long gone.</p><p>And since there&#39;s no power, I doubt I&#39;ll be able to stock up on food or water, either.</p><p>On the plus side, the buildings are mostly untouched, so at least I shouldn&#39;t have to go sifting through rubble.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/VbjPMrY.png" alt=""></p><p>...I can&#39;t believe it.

They then brought it to this base.</p><p>All the other records pertaining to the subject can be summed up in a single word: “gruesome.”</p><p>The scientists performed all kinds of tests, experiments, and surgeries in order to keep this alien visitor alive.</p><p>They conducted clinical trials with different kinds of medicine. They tested every known substance on Earth to see how it would react.</p><p>They observed reactions that corresponded to pain.</p><p>They observed reactions that corresponded to joy.</p><p>To measure its endurance, they stopped supplying it with nutrients. Then they tried burning it. Freezing it. Melting it. Attaching things to it.</p><p>They stirred its intestines around. Cut off parts of its body. Measured signals from the organ they thought was its brain.</p><p>They performed all of this research, what could also be called the very crystallization of human history, on the subject while it was still living.</p><p>...It didn&#39;t take long for the surgical procedures meant to resuscitate the subject to morph into brutally exploitative experiments.</p><p>And since the cells taken from the subject&#39;s samples were made up of elements that didn&#39;t exist anywhere on the planet...</p><p>...it wasn&#39;t hard to imagine that further research could eventually lead to military and civilian applications.</p><p>Truth be told, that was where the top brass&#39;s true interests lied.</p><p>After all, ever since the turn of the twentieth century, the energy race between nations had only continued to pick up speed...</p><p>...and there was now an insurmountable gap between industrialized nations and developing ones.</p><p>I could tell from poring over the documents that they began with the best of intentions.</p><p>They wanted their research to result in a better life for every person on Earth.

Quite the contradiction.</p><p><strong>Transmission Log:</strong> Of course, while we can&#39;t make any definitive statements based on one king&#39;s single passing remark...</p><p><strong>Transmission Log:</strong> ...I do feel confident enough to propose a hypothesis.</p><p><strong>Transmission Log:</strong> I suspect that the blank period between when a Lostbelt was pruned, and when it was “replanted” in the present day...</p><p><strong>Transmission Log:</strong> ...may have actually taken place inside each Tree of Emptiness.</p><p><strong>Transmission Log:</strong> In Russia, that period would have been about five hundred years. In Scandinavia, it would be about three thousand.</p><p><strong>Transmission Log:</strong> In China, it would be about twenty-two hundred, and so on and so forth.</p><p><strong>Transmission Log:</strong> To further expound on my hypothesis...</p><p><strong>Transmission Log:</strong> I suspect that the Trees of Emptiness take the point at which a Lostbelt&#39;s history is pruned...</p><p><strong>Transmission Log:</strong> ...and then simulate what would happen if that history had continued on from that point.</p><p><strong>Transmission Log:</strong> By doing so, the trees effectively prove that history&#39;s existence, and the result is projected onto the planet itself.</p><p><strong>Transmission Log:</strong> If my hypothesis is correct, that would mean the trees are essentially creating history, not rewriting it.</p><p><strong>Transmission Log:</strong> Not even a demiurge-class Divine Spirit that once ruled the entire planet could wield this kind of Authority on Earth in the present day.</p><p><strong>Transmission Log:</strong> Wodime.

Me neither.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> ...No, it&#39;s not just you and me. None of us Crypters know what the Foreign God looks like.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> All we know is, they&#39;re something that resurrected us from our Coffins in exchange for making us raise Lostbelts.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> Except...Wodime&#39;s the only one of us who&#39;s heard directly what the Foreign God&#39;s goal is...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> ...Hm?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> What&#39;s this text file over here by itself?

You&#39;re telling me the Trees of Emptiness only came down to Earth AFTER it had been wiped clean?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> But, that doesn&#39;t make any sense.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> I thought for sure it was the Trees of Emptiness that wiped out Earth and humanity...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> But if Earth had already been bleached before the Trees of Emptiness showed up, then why make them, or the Lostbelts, at all?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> ...Wait. If the Foreign God wanted to get rid of humanity, they wouldn&#39;t bother making Lostbelts in the first place.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> If anything, it seems to me like the whole reason they want to see a bunch of different possible human histories is because they don&#39;t know anything about us.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> But then...why?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> Maybe the bleaching wasn&#39;t to wipe out humanity... but to make an environment they could set foot in?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> ...Maybe they only got rid of humanity because they had no other choice?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> Maybe a world covered in pure white, brand-new textures is the only kind of world the Foreign God can visit?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> But then, if that were the case, the Lostbelts would only get in the way. So what are they and the Trees of Emptiness for?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> ...Dammit, I&#39;m just going around in circles. There&#39;s still some crucial piece of information I&#39;m missing.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> Ugh, just my luck! There&#39;s too many files on this terminal to find the data I need!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> And why are these folders scattered all over the place!? Is it some kind of anti-hacking measure or something?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> Shit. I was hoping I wouldn&#39;t have to touch the big files, but at this rate, I&#39;ll have to copy everything.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> (The Foreign God...)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> (There&#39;s no question that they&#39;re an aggressor, and that they can&#39;t coexist with our history.)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> (As for the whole “god” thing, it&#39;s way more likely they&#39;re a new kind of life-form we know nothing about...)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> (...and “god” is just the best word we have for it.)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> So why make the Lostbelts? Why use us at all? Is it because they still don&#39;t know much about Earth?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> Nah, that can&#39;t be it. We&#39;re talking about a being capable of wiping the whole planet clean in a second.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> Come on, Kadoc, think. There&#39;s no way the Foreign God doesn&#39;t know the first thing about Earth or humanity.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> They must&#39;ve done their homework, or they wouldn&#39;t have known to attack us–Chaldea, before making any other moves..</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> ...So from that, you can tell that the Foreign God is really, really cautious, which is why they&#39;re so careful about keeping their identity a secret.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> Zeus is omnipotent and omniscient, so he doesn&#39;t bother to hide who he is. He&#39;s also had no problem crushing any form of dissent himself.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> The Foreign God&#39;s not at that level yet, which is why they&#39;re still so careful about any information pertaining to them.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> ...That&#39;s it. The Foreign God&#39;s got one major, fatal flaw: they don&#39;t have a physical body yet.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> If they did, even if it was just a Divided Spirit or a terminal, they wouldn&#39;t have to rely on anyone else.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> That&#39;s why they enlisted the Alter Egos, and us Crypters, to be their hands in this world.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> ...Rasputin. Limbo. Muramasa. Why would a foreign being use Heroic Spirits from Earth?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> They might&#39;ve dressed their Alter Ego Disciples up a little, but they&#39;re still figures taken from our history...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> ...Hang on. What if the Foreign God can only make use of things on Earth?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> No, it&#39;s not even that. They can only use things from the past–things that USED to be on Earth.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> (At some point, the Foreign God plans on descending to Earth. At least, that&#39;s what they told Wodime.)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> (And once a Tree of Emptiness is fully grown, it&#39;ll become the Foreign God&#39;s body... So what happens after that?)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> (Maybe, when the Foreign God descends and incarnates on Earth...)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> (...they&#39;re going to base their body on the data about Earth we&#39;ve all been collecting for them.)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> ...Yeah, that&#39;s not a bad theory.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> If the Foreign God absolutely has to have local life-forms, then they must be for output... No, wait. For reference.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> And from there, as long as the Foreign God can guide the local life-forms successfully–</p><p><strong>Voice:</strong> My, my, how very perceptive.

I have no good response to that.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> While I do believe you&#39;re capable of bringing that past and present back...I also can&#39;t deny that I&#39;m passing all that work onto you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> But what you&#39;re doing is no different than the Foreign God.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> You&#39;re wrong there, Fujimaru. It may not be my place to say anything, but since I&#39;m the elder Master, let me give you some advice.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> Now that you&#39;ve seen the Lostbelts for yourself, you know they&#39;re no different from Proper Human History.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> They all had the same goals: unify humanity, make full use of Earth...and keep the world alive.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> But the Foreign God is different. They don&#39;t care about Earth or humanity.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> You might be wondering why they bleached the world then. And you would be right to.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> Think back to Goetia. He didn&#39;t incinerate humanity simply to destroy it, not really. It was only a side effect of his true goal.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> The same holds true for the Foreign God.</p><hr><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/TSsDh13.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> ...It seems the Foreign God has taken measures to deal with me.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> I suppose it only makes sense that they would seek to end my life, since they can&#39;t touch the Tree of Emptiness.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> I&#39;m sorry, but I&#39;m afraid none of you have a choice.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> I&#39;m going to use Tree of Emptiness Atlas to revolutionize the world before the Foreign God can break our contract.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> What you do next is up to you, Fujimaru and Mash.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> You can choose this revolution and its bright future– a future of gods where everyone is happy...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> ...or, you can choose Proper Human History in all its bleakness, with its myriad problems and dead ends.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> But be warned: if you try to interfere, I will show you no mercy.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> This is MY Grand Order; it is the ideal I have fought for through my entire life.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> If you wish to stand in its way, then you must fight with all the strength you possess.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> This planet&#39;s future rests upon the outcome of this battle.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> If you think you can choose a greater future than I...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> If you believe you are strong enough for me to entrust you with the Tree of Emptiness...then prove it.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> I am Kirschtaria Wodime.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> As a Crypter, I denounce Proper Human History.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> I am an enemy of Chaldea, and by extension, you...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> And I am the leader of Team A, who fought to protect humanity!</p><h2 id="advent-of-the-foreign-god" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#advent-of-the-foreign-god" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Advent of the Foreign God</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m detecting a powerful Magical Reactor Core signal inside the Tree of Emptiness!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I can&#39;t measure its magical energy levels with my current equipment!

I don&#39;t know if it would be enough to defeat the Foreign God...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> At this rate, it&#39;s going to suck up not just all of Olympus, but this entire Lostbelt...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> (So, I&#39;m finally getting to see a Beast in person...)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> (I don&#39;t need to use my Noble Phantasm to tell that humanity simply has no hope of defeating her.)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> (The sheer magnitude of her Spirit Origin alone vastly eclipses anything humanity could throw at her. There are simply no conditions that would allow for our victory.)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> (Mesopotamia... Solomon&#39;s Temple of Time...)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> (Chaldea was only able to prevail in those situations because we were an unknown factor.)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> (Indeed, our very existence was such an exception to the rule that we had an almost excessive advantage in the environments where Beasts I and II appeared.)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> (Therefore, no matter how outmatched we may have been, it was always possible for us to alter our fate.)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> (But this Beast is different. She&#39;s had Chaldea in her sights since well before we were even aware of her existence.)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> (We have therefore lost the one advantage we had in those other fights.)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> (Unfortunately, even if the Storm Border were to arrive now, that Beast would simply wipe them all out.)</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> (...It&#39;s elementary, my dear Leonardo.

So you&#39;re not even going to try to fight back, Earthlings?</p><p><strong>U-Olga Marie:</strong> Wait, how silly of me. Of course you can&#39;t fight back. I don&#39;t know why I ever thought you could!</p><p><strong>U-Olga Marie:</strong> I suppose it only makes sense. There is no version of humanity in this universe that is capable of surpassing me.</p><p><strong>U-Olga Marie:</strong> All that aside... You Earthlings truly are pathetic, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>U-Olga Marie:</strong> You&#39;re so tiny. So powerless.

It&#39;s not like you to be so rash.</p><p><strong>???:</strong></p><p>Or are your powers of deduction simply nullified when you attempt to apply them to an alien being?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> !</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Kirschtaria!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Kirsch!?</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> Well now, that almost makes it sound like we&#39;re friends. I didn&#39;t see that coming, but I can&#39;t say I dislike it.</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Kirschtaria Wodime... I didn&#39;t realize you were still alive.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> We mages have magical crests. We don&#39;t go down quite so easily.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> Holmes, you just said there was no possible way for you to turn things around...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> ...but that all depends on how you look at it.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> For example, my victory would be my plan to slay the god succeeding, and my loss would be it failing.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> Now that Atlas&#39;s Tree has been razed to the ground, and the Foreign God has descended upon this world, my plan has ended in abject failure.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> It represents a complete and total loss for me. There is no hope of me turning things around now.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> But the same is not true for you.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> For you, loss would be dying, and victory would be living.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> So even if the Foreign God has descended upon this world, and even if all you can do right now is run away...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> ...merely surviving is enough to ensure your victory.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> And since you haven&#39;t truly lost, you still have a chance to turn things around.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> I understand this is all a bit much coming from me, since I&#39;m the one who invited the Foreign God here in the first place, but oh well.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> Now then...I think it&#39;s time I played my last card.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> Rest assured, I won&#39;t let the Foreign God get away with this.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> Even if it is ultimately fated to vanish once its Tree of Emptiness is gone, I will protect Olympus right to the end.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> After all...I promised Zeus I would.</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> I&#39;ll make sure the Foreign God goes away, though I can only do so temporarily.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> Now go. Get out of here. I&#39;m afraid you&#39;d only get in my way.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Are you sure?</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I mean, you&#39;re obviously badly hurt...</p><hr><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s not as bad as it looks. I&#39;ve still got plenty of fight left in me.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> It&#39;s a shame you and I weren&#39;t able to finish our duel, though. We&#39;ll just have to take a rain check on that.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> At any rate, you&#39;ve got much more work ahead of you than I do.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> ...I&#39;m sorry about this, Fujimaru. I wish I didn&#39;t have to ask you to take on such enormous responsibility again.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...It might not be easy, but I&#39;ll give it everything I&#39;ve got!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...It&#39;s okay. I haven&#39;t come this far just to lose now!</p><hr><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> Mr. Holmes.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> ...Very well. You have my word that I will do everything in my power to give Chaldea a chance to turn things around.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> Good. I&#39;m relieved to hear that. All right then, this is goodbye.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> But before you go, Mash, let me give you one word of advice.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> I won&#39;t deny that, as a Crypter, I considered you and Fujimaru my most dangerous enemies, and tried to eliminate you accordingly.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> I did so because, at the time, I firmly believed that to be what was right.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> ...But of course, humans are fundamentally incapable of making the right choice.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> So the least we can do is keep shamelessly moving toward those things we have chosen, right or wrong.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> I believe that&#39;s what it means to be human. We are nothing if not great at rationalizing our actions.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> Still, trust me when I tell you that there&#39;s no need to fight to assuage a guilty conscience, or to atone for past misdeeds.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> Don&#39;t forget, the reason you left Chaldea to go on a journey was to get as much out of it as possible.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I&#39;m afraid the palace won&#39;t last much longer. We need to evacuate to the great shrine! Come now, quickly!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> R-right...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...U-um, Kirschtaria!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Thank you for everything you did for me at Chaldea! I wish we could have all talked a lot more!</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> Are they gone, Caenis?</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong> What&#39;re you, stupid? Can&#39;t you see for your–</p><p><strong>Caenis:</strong> Yeah, they&#39;re gone. They left your sorry ass behind. Didn&#39;t even look back. So you don&#39;t gotta worry about them. Mess this bitch up. Hell, I&#39;ll even let you lean on me.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> Thank you. That will be a big help. ...What about you, Father? Aren&#39;t you going to stop me?</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong> Not at all. Not unless the Foreign God gives the order to eliminate you two.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong> I&#39;m only here to serve as a witness. Truth be told, it should be quite educational.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong> No matter how powerful one may be, this planet still follows its own rules.</p><p><strong>Priest:</strong> This will be an excellent way for the Foreign God to learn that lesson.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> ...In that case, don&#39;t mind if I do.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> Stars. Cosmos. Gods. Animus.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> 　Antrum. Unbirth.</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> 　Anima, Animusphere...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> There are yet the lights of stars in the void. Illuminate the earth, stay aloft the sky...</p><p><strong>Kirschtaria:</strong> ...and illustrate the coordinates of the heavens.

Did you really just say that? What&#39;s more, Moriarty is so surprised that he&#39;s been rendered speechless.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s such a shame!</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong> Umm, guys?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> A-Apologies...now then, ahem.</p><p>&quot;Open Sesame&quot;.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> An earthquake...?</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/4QVhmPd.png" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/2i0vrps.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> Hey, why are there stairs in a place like this...? Does this mean we&#39;re headed underground?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Well, I wonder about that. Are you stout-hearted enough to go?</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong> Let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Right!</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZF9bB1k.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Both:</strong> You&#39;re way too easy going!</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> ...Shall we go?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Yes we shall...</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/noCylz0.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s rather deep...</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong> I can hardly see anything...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> That&#39;s a problem too, but even more problems abound. This staircase isn&#39;t made of stone.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, you&#39;re right. From the feel of it...it&#39;s definitely man-made. It feels so very modern...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Do be careful, if you happen to fall, you&#39;ll never stop falling.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> Nonetheless, we have descended quite a fair bit. The third basement level...no, the fourth?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> A rough estimate of our destination would place it around the tenth basement level. In all likelihood, they were wary of deep penetration ordnance such as bunker busters.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> ...</p><p>...Huh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Bunker buster...?</p><p>Oh, I get that it&#39;s the name of the weapon and such...</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Am65JkH.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> But that&#39;s a modern military weapon, is it not? Is that relevant?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> More than you can imagine, let us move on.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Well this is as far as the stairs go. Are you all right, the three of you?</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong> I-I&#39;m beat...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> It takes quite a mental toll to go down a staircase in pitch black darkness.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master, your hand please. I believe it will help you be at ease a little—!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master!</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/i4jrH7C.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> Zhang Jiaoo...!?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> No need to concern yourselves with him. He&#39;s already dead.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Zhang Jiao:</strong> ...</p><p>...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> I&#39;m not too familiar with it myself. Let&#39;s see, umm...that&#39;s it.</p><p>I believe he&#39;s an existence referred to as a shijiexian. However, as long as he remains a corpse, his Master won&#39;t be supplying him with magical energy.</p><p>So Zhang Jiao had little choice but to create an alter ego of himself, while erasing its self-awareness as an alter ego at the same time. For it would lose its sense of self should it gain awareness of its status as an alter ego, putting it at risk of annihailation.</p><p>Even if the assassination plan should succeed, even if he should fall in the final battle...</p><p>As long as he, the real self, remains in existence here, he will create an alter ego and revive. The revived alter ego would have eventually restored this Singularity. And then invite the summoned servants in, incite conflict, and instigate a war between realms once more.</p><p>All for the sake of his Master.</p><p>That&#39;s over now though. The cost of creating an alter ego is that he systemized his own real self. Incapable of self-defense, incapable of self-growth, little more than—</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/6WDtck5.png" alt=""></p><p>Furniture.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> Was...Zhang Jiaoo...protecting this place?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> No. It would be more accurate to say he had no choice but to do so. You could say that while his Master created this Singularity, it was Zhang Jiaoo who nurtured it. It was his dedication to it that made this Singularity so intricately bizarre.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Now then, I&#39;ll open the door. From this point onward, communication with Chaldea will likely be rendered impossible. It&#39;s already gotten erratic, has it not?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...He&#39;s got a point there, the signal&#39;s about to cut off. The three of you be careful now.</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong> Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll be right back.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/f2T3XCp.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yup!</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/1jX3lnv.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> No matter what may happen, make sure to prioritize your safe return, Kadoc Zemlupus.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> Got it.</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> It pains me to say this...but you&#39;re the only one we can count on. After all, the two of them there are the foolhardy type!</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/KtC8tfq.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> Yeah, I&#39;m welllll aware of that.</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong> I-Is that so?</p><p><strong>Goredolf:</strong> That. Is. So.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> In any case, take care.

Now, let us move on to ground zero of this Singularity.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ground...zero...</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> But this is almost like—</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong> Kadoc?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> No...it&#39;s nothing.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> How far will we be walking this time?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Oh, I assure you it&#39;ll be quite the short stroll.</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong> ...All right, let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Right!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>The quartet walked wordlessly down the cosmic corridor.</p><p>They had no time to admire the beautiful yet horrifying sights before them, or perhaps there simply was no room for fear.</p><p>There was this oppressive feeling, as though the walls were closing in. As though they were driven by necessity.</p><p>Kadoc, Mash, and Fujimaru.</p><p>What swept across their minds was a truly distressing feeling. It was neither unpleasant nor uncomfortable.</p><p>It was like restlessly traversing a mountain in the dark of night.</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m about to see something truly ominous.&quot;</p><p>A strange certainty of that nature.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> The Master of this Singularity lies up ahead. Needless to say, its act is one of revenge and retribution against Pan-Human History.</p><p>He has that right—I believe that is what you were told before, Kadoc?</p><p>But that&#39;s not quite accurate. He was not in a position to do otherwise. He was obligated to do so, as it was his duty to do so.</p><p>Even should the intent to retaliate be absent, as an entity, he was in a position where he could not do otherwise.</p><p>And the Servant, Zhang Jiaoo, established this extreme-scale Singularity to fulfill that wish.</p><p>Using Area 51, Nevada, USA in the year 2017—as its point of origin.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> We&#39;ve arrived. This is the final door. I presume you&#39;re ready?</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master.</p><p><strong>Fujimaru:</strong> Open it, Moriarty.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Understood.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/rY0fkmX.png" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/kZvXkz7.png" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Vt88xlx.png" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7Owx9Lv.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>—What lay before their eyes was an unremarkable yet outlandish scenery.</p><p>Kadoc Zemlupus had lived his life as a magus.
