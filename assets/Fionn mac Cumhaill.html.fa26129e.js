But that&#39;s just the end result.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> I killed a raging demonic beast, and slaughtered a creature from the underworld you could call death itself.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> But, all that is expected of a guardian of Erin, a warrior serving the High King.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> The deed would have been done without me. For we are the glorious Knights of Fianna!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fou.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, Fou. ...It sounds pretty heroic to me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But you&#39;re being modest. Fionn mac Cumhaill of Fianna, guardian of Erin.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Huh? Modest? That&#39;s modesty? All it sounds like to me is bragging...</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> Haha, surely you jest. I&#39;m just a man. I&#39;ve nothing to brag about to anyone\u2013</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> Am I sure? Well, I&#39;m sure I&#39;m the hero who managed to slay a fallen Divine Spirit.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> I&#39;m the descendant of the war god Nuadha, and the central figure in the Erin myth? But see, that&#39;s merely the end result.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> I&#39;m simply a man. Yes\u2013just a handsome man whose face is slightly more beautiful.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You called yourself a handsome man!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What self-confidence.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Ugh, so bright! It&#39;s like a flood of self-confidence and bragging, isn&#39;t it!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Why does it hit me so hard... So this is Fionn mac Cumhaill, the most fulfilled man in all of Erin!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Protector of peace who has beaten many monsters\u2013 He&#39;s fit to be called a hero, a great hero.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But, well, Master. Well...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Fionn had his fair share of problems... Calamities...or more like troubles...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Has he?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I think I&#39;ve heard something.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Yes. You might say he had \u201Clady troubles.\u201D</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Fionn may not be personally responsible, but if what I heard about the Knights of Fianna&#39;s downfall is true...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> it was partly due to his actions. At the very least, that&#39;s how the knights portray it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> By not saving the life of his reconciled subordinate, Diarmuid, he lost his charisma, and the order collapsed\u2013</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> Hm? What do you speak of, Mash? Having second thoughts about marrying me?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> N-No, not at all! I&#39;d never marry you!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> Oh? Is that so? Hahaha, \u201Cnever\u201D is so harsh!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (Senpai, keep this between us, okay?)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (Fionn knows about the Order&#39;s collapse in his memories, but...he doesn&#39;t feel like part of it.)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (Like when we met Alexander before. Not the King of Conquerors of his later years, but the boy.)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (I think this is similar. He&#39;s been summoned in his young form. That&#39;s why\u2013)</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> (I see. So, he&#39;s aware of his later failures, but feels like they happened to someone else, right?)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (Yes, Doctor.)</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> What are you whispering about... Oh, I see. Rumors about me? Is that it?</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> No need to bite my thumbs. I already know. Mash\u2013</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> \u2013You&#39;ve fallen in love with me. Sorry about that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> !?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> !? (Even though she said she&#39;d never, like, 5 seconds ago!?)</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fo, fou!?</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> I am aware of it. Of how I&#39;m almost way too beautiful.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> This face, this physique. It must almost be cruel to you girls...</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> Thus my fate, namely\u2013 My lady troubles! My never-ending assault of lady troubles!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> Yes, I need only stand still, and noble ladies will propose to me. I even once received a twin love confession from a lovely pair of witch sisters.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> T-Twin confession! Do things like that actually happen in real life!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;m beyond envious... I don&#39;t know about you as a person, but you shine so brightly as a man, Fionn mac Cumhaill...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!?</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> My most beloved person, treasure of Erin... My first wife, to be specific...</p><p>Yes. How she and I loved each other... It was so instant and eternal...</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> That it made an evil fairy start stalking me like an idiot! Oh, this is all part of my destiny of endless lady troubles!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> Oh, however, I don&#39;t want to put the blame on you ladies.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> It&#39;s fate, and so nothing can be done. Overflowing beauty can drive a woman mad, at times.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> I&#39;m just...too beautiful...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Dazzling, too dazzling...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Y-Yes... Certainly...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Um, are we done here?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai, I don&#39;t think he can hear you\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Fionn seems to think the source of all his troubles is always from elsewhere.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> He&#39;s right, in a sense... But that&#39;s... No.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fooou.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Right, Fou. Just a bit... He doesn&#39;t seem fully satisfied...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;m terribly dissatisfied! Why do popular guys get even more popular?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> W-Well, never mind. Anyway, why did we come here all the way to the 1st century?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> To the Ancient Roman era that&#39;s under correction, and heading out specifically to Gaul\u2013</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> I don&#39;t have actual business in Gaul. I sensed danger in Erin and my feet led me here.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Erin... Ireland?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Oh, I see. You didn&#39;t come to Gaul. You&#39;re trying to get closer to Ireland.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> Right, and I guess I was on the spot.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> They seem to have sensed our approach, and they&#39;re coming out to greet us.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Guuuu!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Detecting hostile presences! Senpai, here they come... Combat instruction, please!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Charge them head-on!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Calm down!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Confirmed defeat of the first wave! But the next one will be inbound soon!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This isn&#39;t the first giant \u201Chand\u201D we&#39;ve seen\u2013 but something seems strange, Senpai!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> They seemed to be leading beastmen?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> They&#39;re after Fionn?</p><hr><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> Ah, this sensation really brings back memories... Of the time when I was a mere traveler, and not the leader of the Order.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> I\u2013</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> I! I faced evil as a lone warrior!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> Against those who cruelly murdered innocents! Yes, I... I know about you!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> \u2013Come and get me!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> M-More are coming!?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Guuuu!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Here comes the second wave! No... They&#39;ve revived!? And there are more of them! Be careful!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> ...Hm. So I guess that&#39;s all of them.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> You made it through the fight unharmed. The disturbance I felt is now gone.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That giant hand... Was that the danger you sensed?</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> Oh, yeah. Well, I guess it turned out to be that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That was an unknown enemy we&#39;ve met multiple times. We have no accurate data on it\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But you talked as if you knew something about it. Is it possible...you have some idea?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;d like to hear it, too. Yeah... You definitely sounded like you know something!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Wait, he&#39;s ignoring me? He&#39;s ignoring what I say?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Please, Fionn. If you know anything, please don&#39;t hide it...</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> ...How can I keep my mouth shut when such a lovely lady looks at me with such passion.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Right, so...that&#39;s how it is... He really is ignoring me...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, foou...</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> That said, this is just a hunch. I don&#39;t have enough evidence right now.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> As captain of the glorious Knights of Fianna, I can&#39;t afford to make an unsightly mistake in front of a lady.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> So, could you give me some time? When I have solid proof, I&#39;ll most definitely tell you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Senpai.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Can&#39;t be helped.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Looks like we have to wait.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I see. I understand, Fionn.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> Now, with the power of my Noble Phantasm of wisdom, \u201CFintan Finegas\u201D\u2013</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> we&#39;d solve any riddle instantly, but that would be boring, wouldn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Boring!? If it&#39;ll tell us everything, then use it, please?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Like making a prediction about the King of Mages&#39; next move! There are other things I&#39;d like to know as well so... Please?</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> Hah hah hah. I&#39;d say he probably set up some countermeasures so it can&#39;t be easily predicted. Same goes for that giant hand.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Ugh... Fine, b-but what&#39;s with the name of your Noble Phantasm!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> Anyways, Mash. May I ask something?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Sure. What is it?</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> I did ask you to wait, but there are things that we can talk about without waiting.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> So, let&#39;s go to My Room and discuss in detail. You&#39;re curious about me, too, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You said \u201Cabout me\u201D just now?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That room isn&#39;t yours, is it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fionn:</strong> ...Right. Okay, Fujimaru can come, too. That&#39;s fine by me!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> W-Wait!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Man, he&#39;s full of energy. Still, I&#39;d like to learn a thing or two from him, too...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fouuuuu!</p>',148),a=[r];function i(h,g){return n(),t("div",null,a)}var l=o(s,[["render",i],["__file","Fionn mac Cumhaill.html.vue"]]);export{l as default};
