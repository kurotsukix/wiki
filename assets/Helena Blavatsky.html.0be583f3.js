If not, then my entire operating paradigm has been incorrect all this time.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> ...Yep. You&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> Although, such a thing can only be considered to be the world&#39;s truth.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> As one who would know the Swirl of the Root, my idiotic agony must sound so trivial right now.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> ...Yes. I&#39;m sure that is true.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> I&#39;m not sure myself, but I sense Mahatma from your words.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> That&#39;s why I&#39;m rooting for you. Good luck, Paracelsus!</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> Thank you very much, Helena Blavatsky. You&#39;re brilliant.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> You know the phrase \u201Cprotection of the Buddha\u201D? That&#39;s why I&#39;m here...</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> I&#39;m sure you&#39;re under such protection too. Probably. In fact, I&#39;d say it&#39;s thanks to this protection that Chaldea still exists!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Even in the face of the Incineration of Humanity, we survived!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> That&#39;s why the Buddha is amazing. My master was especially amazing.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Not only am I able to borrow their palm heel, but they see and know everything. Beyond amazing, really.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> The compassionate and merciful Kannon is also beyond amazing. I&#39;ve never seen anyone with more to offer.</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Yesterday, today, and even tomorrow... The protection of the Buddha is forever!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> But you know, Wukong and Bajie didn&#39;t quite get it.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> ...Oh really?</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Right after their vows, they went straight for some meat! In an instant! In a heartbeat!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Wukong would say things like, \u201CMay the protection of the Buddha reach even my stomach!\u201D That&#39;s not right! No!</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> Uh-huh. I see.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> In many sects of Buddhism, the clergy is forbidden from eating meat, right?</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> But then these disciples break such precepts immediately. Beyond annoying.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> On the other hand, I see that you are faithful to the Enlightened One&#39;s teachings, and I sense a high Mahatma from you. Good luck!</p><p><strong>Sanzang:</strong> Hee hee. You think so? Okay. Let us both devote our lives to our faiths!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Mahatma...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What does that mean?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Hello, Senpai. I&#39;ve been watching as you puzzled over this, but...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I honestly don&#39;t know what she means when she says that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I do know that Mahatma was supposedly an existence of some kind that Helena mentioned often in her life.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A spiritual existence of high order. They apparently imparted wisdom and truth through documents.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> And priestess figures who received such documents supposedly included Helena herself.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AMash:</strong> ...Details about Mahatma and their true form are a mystery. There is no mention about them in Chaldea&#39;s database, at least.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AMash:</strong> Helena doesn&#39;t offer much in the way of detail on the subject, either.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What&#39;s a Mahatma...?</p><hr><p><strong>Helena:</strong> ...Hm? You called?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh. Hello, Helena.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> How do you do, Mash, Fujimaru? Do you two want to know about Mahatma?</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> Though you know... Hm... What shall I do? I could have you read my book about it. But, hmmm...</p><p><strong>F\uFF1A???:</strong> \u201CThe Secret Doctrine\u201D is a book of mysteries that covers ancient and modern science and theology.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That voice...</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> Hey. Who&#39;s there?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> It&#39;s an important book, and serves as the foundation of modern occultism, but it&#39;s not the sort of work we mages should use.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> ...Sorry for the intrusion. I just heard a familiar title and couldn&#39;t help but respond.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> So you&#39;ve read my book! Does that mean you feel Mahatma too?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Of course I&#39;ve read it. I see. So you&#39;re THE Helena Blavatsky.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> I had hoped to meet and speak to you. Miss, would you spare me some time?</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> Of course! I get it! You&#39;re a fan of mine!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (Birds of a feather?)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (You&#39;re right, Senpai. It seems like they are getting along!)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (Incoming magecraft lecture.)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (Perhaps. I&#39;m not sure if I can keep up...)</p><hr><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> What intrigues me is that much what you&#39;ve said seems to contradict the teachings of Theosophy as a field.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Theosophy as a field involves study and exploration. Its pursuit of the truth of the world and gods is similar to what we mages do...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> But it is still just an academic field. It&#39;s not that Theosophy is similar to mages...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> But rather that mages are simply academics.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Yet...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Yet, you practice magecraft. Even while you speak of Mahatma and the Hierarchy...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> You cast a variety of spells, using the archaic magecraft foundation that Theosophy claims does not exist.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> Eh? Y-you&#39;re right. I do not feel Mahatma from that as much.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> She&#39;s changed her usual line...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (Yes, this is a bit different for her...)</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> ...What exactly do your beliefs cover?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Don&#39;t you think that the Theosophy that you speak of is making a mockery of the actual modern Theosophy?</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Unless...instead of Theosophy, it&#39;s your own talents you are mocking...</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> U-unnnngh. When you say it that way...</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> It&#39;s true that I was the one who spread Theosophy to the modern world, but in broader terms, it was like a new kind of Platonism or Gnosticism...</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> It included many things from the past, and in this case, it included Paracelsus&#39;s books too...</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> I guess you can say it&#39;s my philosophy. But... But...</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> The teachings really expanded during Adyarism or Yeats&#39;s time...</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> ...In other words...</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong></p><p>AFTER I DIED!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> M-my apologies. I did not intend to anger you.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> You dummy! Why you... Why you...! Lord El-Melloi II&#39;s a stupidhead!!!</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> Stop tormenting me like the SPR!!! Waaaahh!!!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> N-no, I had no intention to...</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> Waaaaaaaaahhhhhh!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> S-Senpai! The usually kind and mature Helena...is throwing a childlike tantrum!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I-I&#39;ve never seen her so angry before!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You may be right. Helena is normally the one to calm Edison and Tesla down...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I like this side of her!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong></p><p>Senpai!</p><hr><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Hm, what&#39;s going on, teacher? Did you make a woman angry?</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> I never knew teacher was such a lady-killer. Yeah... I&#39;m curious about how you&#39;ll handle this.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> No, I... Hm? What&#39;s that dark shadow behind you?</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Oh this? It caught me back there. I thought I got away, but it looks like it followed me here.</p><p><strong>Darius III:</strong></p><p>IS...KANDAR!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Hey, it&#39;s getting rowdy around here!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It is, and now I sense danger!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I have a bad feeling about this!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Me too!</p><hr><p><strong>Helena:</strong> ... (Gasp!?)</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> Wh-what is the meaning of this!? I can&#39;t believe you got so many people on your side! Explain yourself, Lord El-Melloi II!!!</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> Well then, that means I&#39;ll have to...</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Um, no, please don&#39;t misunderstand, Lady Blavatsky. Please wait. That giant Servant is not on my side...</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> Thanks for calling me a lady. But too late. I&#39;ve started up the Simulator.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> Come at me, Lord El-Melloi II! You too, Alex and Mister Darius III!</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> You&#39;re all going to get a taste of the power of Mahatma! Brace yourselves!!!</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> Fujimaru and Mash! You&#39;re on my side! Got it!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Y-yes, ma&#39;am!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Shoulda seen this coming...</p><hr><p><strong>Helena:</strong> LET&#39;S. GO!</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> ...Lemuria slumbers in the seas! The Hierarchy graces the skies! And...</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> And I! In the name of Mahatma... I&#39;m going to let off steam!</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> Wait, wait! Let off steam!?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Simulation battle, completed! For the time being, Helena wins...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But it seemed pretty clear that El-Melloi II was attempting to throw the match...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m tired...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I am too.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> W-well, all&#39;s well that ends well!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Y-yes you&#39;re right. I like your thinking, Senpai...</p><hr><p><strong>Helena:</strong> (Sigh) ...I&#39;m no good.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> I vowed to be nice, but sometimes I can&#39;t help but explode like that.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> Especially when I think of the time when the SPR called me a fraud.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> I&#39;m sorry I gave in to my emotions, Mister. I&#39;m embarrassed to face Mahatma.</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> No, I...</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Hey, did you just say Mahatma, the great teacher? Do you know Mahatma?</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> Eh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Eh...</p><p><strong>Darius III:</strong> ???</p><p><strong>El-Melloi II:</strong> ...Wait. Are you telling us that you know what Mahatma is?</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Well, yeah?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Really!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Uh, I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s true...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (Y-yes, Senpai... Even though Alexander talks like he&#39;s familiar with it...)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (Do you really believe Alexander knows what Mahatma is, when even El-Melloi II isn&#39;t sure himself?)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (Although, Alexander did learn from Aristotle in Mieza...so it may be possible?)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (Or perhaps, like Helena, he had a gifted mage nearby...)</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> Seriously!? You know!? Of Mahatma!?</p><p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Yep. I do.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> Oh my! That&#39;s amazing! Well I...do sense strong Mahatma!!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> (...Is it over?)</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> (Hm. It would appear to be.)</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> (Yes, indeed it is over. She&#39;s laughing. It appears our dear Helena is in a good mood now.)</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> (Whew...even I thought the worst this time around.)</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> (I was worried that fancy suit here triggered her by bringing up the times she was called a fraud, but it seems my fears were unfounded.)</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> (Yes. I thought the dimwit here complained about Helena&#39;s moving lab again. Evidently I was mistaken.)</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> What did you say!?</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong> Say that again, fool!</p><p><strong>Lion &amp; Gentleman:</strong> (Oops...shhh...)</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> You are right.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> It is not unusual for each mage to have their own unique usage of odd words and phrases.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> For example, I use terms like \u201Cprima materia,\u201D \u201Ctransmutation product,\u201D and \u201Cquinta essentia.\u201D</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> In the world of alchemy, especially during my time, these words were not unique...</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> ...but not all mages use them. Come to think of it, I believe the first founders of the Clock Tower likely used different terms.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> That&#39;s why this is probably the same for her.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> First off, there is no doubting her genius. Such people are generally misunderstood by the common masses.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> The Mahatma that she speaks of...and what that means...</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> In order to truly understand, one would need to be on the same level as her.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> Oh, and by the way, Master...</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> Apropos of nothing, I just happened to prepare an elixir...</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> It temporarily strengthens the limbic system, the cerebral nerves, and even magical circuits.</p><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> Would you like a sip?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> No thank you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Nope! (Nope!)</p><hr><p><strong>Paracelsus:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> ...You right there. Yes, you.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> Theosophy, was it? If that magecraft is what its name suggests, it must be a study of godly wisdom.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> It must be something that didn&#39;t originate in the Age of Gods, so I don&#39;t expect anything grandiose...</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> But I don&#39;t mind it, Helena Blavatsky. I have a certain interest in those who strive to reach the gods.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> ...Yes. Thank you, Medea.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> My magecraft was given to me by Hekate. Calling them similar is probably off the mark.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> But I do believe it&#39;s closer than that of modern mages. I sense yours is not obsessed with reaching the Root.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> ...Um...</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> Y-yes. Yep. You&#39;re probably right. I do feel Mahatma from\u2014</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> No, I&#39;m sorry. Let me be honest with you, Medea.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> ...?</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> The Mahatma and Hierarchy that I have been sensing until today...</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> I am not sure whether they are the same beings as the gods of the Age of Gods.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> I personally believe that true Mahatmas are the supernatural beings who have reached the Swirl of the Root, or at least have come in contact with the Root.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> Whether it would be appropriate to call them gods is something that I honestly cannot determine.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> Hmm... I&#39;m not experienced enough to recognize Mahatma and Divine Spirits properly.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> But... But... There&#39;s one thing I know for sure.</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> Hekate. The Goddess Hekate...</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> Possessing Authority over the earth, the sea, and the sky, who offered many blessings to those who prayed to her...</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> I think she is one of the most distinguished deities in Greek mythology!</p><p><strong>Helena:</strong> Seriously. From the bottom of heart. I sense tons of Mahatma!</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> Heh. You make me blush.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> For you to honestly admit your own inexperience and foolishness is proof of your growth.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> Helena Blavatsky. Let me grant you the gift of words.</p><p><strong>Medea:</strong> The wisdom of the gods... A small shard just for you.</p>',223),r=[a];function h(g,i){return t(),o("div",null,r)}var l=e(n,[["render",h],["__file","Helena Blavatsky.html.vue"]]);export{l as default};
