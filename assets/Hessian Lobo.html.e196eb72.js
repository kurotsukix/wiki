Please don&#39;t run off on your own like that, Nursery Rhyme.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong> Master is trusting me to keep you safe, just in case.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> Oh, don&#39;t be such a worrywart, Enkidu.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> I might not be as strong as you, but I&#39;m still a Servant.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong> I know.

Oh, oh, oh?</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> What is it, Mr. Dullahan?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong> I see.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong> Thinking back, the reports from Shinjuku did say that you had a consciousness of your own.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong> Very well then, let me ask you: What is it Lobo wants?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The wolf imagines it would be so much easier to be an ordinary beast.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Feasting on prey... Baring one&#39;s fangs at enemies...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Running from those stronger than you... Learning their scent, and never going near them again...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> But once you begin to lead a pack, that simple life is no longer an option.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> You need to think ahead. You need to worry about contingencies.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> You need to make tough calls.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> You need to howl so loud that everything for kilometers knows this land belongs to you.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The wolf had subordinates. A mate. Cubs.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> And so, he had to fight.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> But a beast is only possessed of so much wisdom, and the desires of humanity are without end.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...Which is why this was inevitable. The beast had no reason to hold a grudge.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> And so, the beast was summoned as a Phantom Spirit, and fused into a Servant.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Before, he could not hope to fight humans on equal footing, but now, he possesses strength far beyond human capability.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> So he exercised his right to vengeance and began wielding his fearsome jaws left and right.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I have no regrets. \u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000/This is bestial instinct.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Intelligence torments me. \u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000/That is what it means to sin.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> My pack is gone. \u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000/I am no longer even a beast.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> A lone, headless ghost appears.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> He neither speaks nor moves.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> No threat makes him flinch, and no glare seems to make him so much as budge.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> But what else could one expect? He lacks a head.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> He may look human, but he is something far removed from them.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The beast thinks that is why he can put up with having him around.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Those two are similarly lacking in the scent of humanity, which makes them bearable as well.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...Yes. It&#39;s all right as long as they don&#39;t smell human.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> But Servants still reek of humanity, and the beast just can&#39;t tolerate it.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> Let&#39;s have some tea!</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong> I&#39;m fine with just hot water.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> Not for my teatime, Enkidu.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> You&#39;re getting tea with lots of sugar, and a little gingery zest. How about you, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Give me a cup with the works.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> Teehee. You can be so greedy sometimes, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> No sugar for me, please.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> Teehee. Yes, you&#39;ve got to watch those calories!</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong> Shouldn&#39;t you try to stock up on nutrients while you can? You are our Master, after all.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> Now don&#39;t be like that, Enkidu. It&#39;s rude.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong> Is it? I see. So it&#39;s rude to treat health management and food preferences in the same way. I&#39;ll have to remember that.</p><hr><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong> ...So that&#39;s about what we were able to learn from him.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I see...</p><hr><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong> Honestly, I don&#39;t think anything needs to change. Lobo is useful as is, and he&#39;s not about to turn traitor.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> Yes, that&#39;s very true.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> Every Servant has different baggage we bring with us when we fight alongside Master.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> The important thing is that we all share the same goal of restoring humanity.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> So I can see the sense in not requiring that we all get to be great friends!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> But, even so...</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> ...that would be so, so sad that I...I just couldn&#39;t stand it!</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong> So...you mean you can understand those reasons, but not accept them?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong> True, we don&#39;t want our allies to be sad. I understand that now, at least a little.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong> Well, Master? What should we do?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...A familiar scent stirs the beast to wakefulness.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> He begins to growl, both as an alert and a threat.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> But the footsteps continue straight toward him, undeterred.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> And so, the beast comes face-to-face with the [\u2642 boy /\u2640\uFE0F girl}.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I want you to come fight with me.</p><hr><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The beast consents.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...He bears no ill will towards the [\u2642 boy /\u2640\uFE0F girl}.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> It is merely that his power comes from the fires consuming him from within.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> To accept the Master in front of him would be to deny his thirst for revenge.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> So he barks. He growls. He bares his fangs and keeps his distance.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> For there can never be true understanding between man and beast.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p>b&gt;Enkidu** Well that was easy. Though I can&#39;t say I care for this city.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong> It feels as though evil and vice have soaked into every brick of every building.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> I don&#39;t like it here, either. My lovely dress is going to get filthy.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong> Now then...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong> It looks like a Demonic Beast has settled here in Shinjuku and is causing all kinds of trouble.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong> How do we go about finding it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Lobo, would you track it down for us?</p><hr><p><strong>Narration:</strong> He barks affirmatively.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> He will find this Demonic Beast hiding somewhere in Shinjuku, and finish it.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> He will follow its scent and ensure it has nowhere left to run.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> That is his mission.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Although...doing this for his Master almost makes him feel like...a dog.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> So the beast thinks to himself as he sneers in the darkness.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong> Looks like he found it. Let&#39;s go.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The beast breaks into a run, as if to keep the clay creature running off in front of him under control.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> And then, the beast sees the being tying him down to this world, almost daring him to escape.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> His Master, Fujimaru. The one they call \u201Chuman.\u201D</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The beast likes the air in this city. It makes him feel at ease.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> There may not be much good food to go around, but maybe that&#39;s why he finds it so easy to take a bite out of whatever he encounters.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The bright lights are more vivid, and more garish, than that starry sky he once knew.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> It&#39;s not as lonely here as it is under the stars.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Humans made this place. They permeate every corner of it. Normally, it would be anathema to him.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> But now, the beast has no choice but to live within it.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> What&#39;s wrong?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The girl with the faint scent of pulped wood looks at him quizzically, her face aglow with innocence.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The beast growls as if to say \u201Cnothing\u201D and turns his gaze forward.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Behind him, Master continues to follow at a respectful distance.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> [\u2642 He&#39;s /\u2640\uFE0F She&#39;s} close, but not too close.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...The beast wonders what would happen if he suddenly tried to bite Master&#39;s head off.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The answer is simple.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The clay and paper people would kill him mercilessly, before he could so much as get near enough to try.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> That&#39;s why this distance makes sense. It&#39;s the right decision, both logically and tactically.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> His whole body shakes with excitement. He&#39;s found it.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong> There it is. Let&#39;s get it, Master!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> This is no fun. It&#39;s so very, very sad.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> A goat from the mountains, a lion from the plains, a snake from the grass... They could have all had happy lives if they had stayed where they belong.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The beast heartily agrees.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> But seeing this abomination, he also can&#39;t help but feel proud that it has the same spark as him.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> It is a grotesque man-made Demonic Beast.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> A monster with the freedom to wander anywhere it pleases because it has no place to call home.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> If there is one thing the Demonic Beast all but shouts, it is this: \u201CWe are strong.\u201D</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong> Hmm. It doesn&#39;t seem like we&#39;ve caught up to it so much as it&#39;s been lying in wait for us.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> An absurd number of Demonic Beasts stand before the wolf and his companions.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> Uh-oh, that&#39;s not good. Please give us your orders, Master!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> In an instant, any sympathy the wolf had for the creatures before him is gone, replaced with an uncompromising will to fight...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...even though the monster is surrounded by his former brethren.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Can you do this, Hessian Lobo?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...Of course I can. Who do you think you&#39;re talking to, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Are you all okay to fight?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong> Of course. We&#39;ll crush them.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> Ooh, I don&#39;t like violence at all.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> But if I have to get my hands bloody today, I&#39;ll make sure this sunny day is Humpty-Dumpty&#39;s last!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...Of course.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> These fangs are meant for crushing my enemies&#39; skulls. These claws are meant for tearing them to shreds.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> And what&#39;s more...they are meant to help me survive, and to keep others alive.</p><hr><p><strong>Narration:</strong> A single roar, and half of the wolves gathered like familiars around the monster scattered in fear.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The beasts&#39; instincts won out over their loyalty to their leader.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> So I shall show no mercy to any of my brethren who still remain. They have chosen instead to be my prey!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong> That takes care of the monster&#39;s entourage, though they were stronger than I expected.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong> That chimera&#39;s Spirit Origin is as strong as the ones from my time. Maybe it&#39;s because of how much technology has progressed, or how human desires have built up over time...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong> Regardless, it would seem this is what it means for a city to grow. Maybe the emergence of some strange beast like this was just inevitable.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong> !</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong> So, it&#39;s running away. And it&#39;s much faster than I thought...!</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong> Let&#39;s go after it, Master!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> What a pain!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The beast tells Hessian to help Master onto his back.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> ...Oh my.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong> ...Interesting.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...Run.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The wolf goes after the Demonic Beast with all his might.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> He can hear his passenger screaming above him, but Hessian should take care of that.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> He does not regret killing his brethren, but neither is he happy about it.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The wolf continues to run, not stopping to consider what that might mean.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> These woods smell rotten. But I won&#39;t stop now.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I will kill that Demonic Beast. I won&#39;t rest until I find it.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...Why do I hate it so much? Why...?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Because it reminds me of myself.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I&#39;m sure it never asked to be born. I&#39;m sure it never wanted to kill.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> But at some point, that Demonic Beast lost sight of who it was.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> At some point, it stopped being a Demonic Beast and instead became a monster.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> No beast should ever cross that line.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...I remember the fight to the death that took place here in Shinjuku.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I went from beast to Demonic Beast, and from Demonic Beast to monster.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I tried to stay a beast at heart, but I ended up consumed by the fires of vengeance burning within me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...That&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I was already a monster when I answered Moriarty&#39;s summons.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> And ever since the Age of Myth, there has only been one possible ending to a monster&#39;s story.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> It wreaks havoc on its surroundings, and dies afraid and regretful.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Well, not today. Today, I&#39;m going to finish that Demonic Beast before it can complete its transformation into a monster.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...There it is.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The wolf faces its prey, bares its fangs, and gathers its strength.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Its rider gently helps Master down to the ground. Now, there is nothing holding him back.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...The hunt begins.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The wolf jumps off a nearby tree, using the springy branches to launch into a spiraling slash.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The wolf&#39;s dark claws and the lion&#39;s glistening fangs clash fiercely in midair...again and again.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> On one side, the wolf who remained true to himself even as he became a Demonic Beast...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...and on the other, a chimera, a grotesque Demonic Beast decried as an abomination from the day it was born.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The mountain goat&#39;s horns keep the wolf&#39;s fangs from finding their mark. The lion&#39;s fangs keep the rider at bay.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The snake tail harries the wolf with bites all over its body.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The fountains of blood only make the wolf more ferocious. His roiling hatred is on the brink of awakening a wholly new form.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...What do you think? Can you do this?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The wolf is unsure if he just heard Hessian&#39;s voice, or Master&#39;s, but it doesn&#39;t matter.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> His only answer is an affirmative howl.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I can.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> He signals to Master, who nods back and activates one of [\u2642 his /\u2640\uFE0F her} Command Spells.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> His body shivers as magical energy begins coursing through his body.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...What do you think? Can you do this?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> His answer is the same as before.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> But now, he realizes that it is he who is asking the question.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I can do this. I can do this. I can do this. I can do this. I can do this. I can do this. I can do this...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I WILL do this.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The rider drops his scythe-shaped sword, and the wolf immediately catches it between his teeth.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> At the same time, the rider&#39;s mantle itself transforms into a fan of blades.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The wolf explodes forward like a bullet, swinging his blade like the Grim Reaper himself.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> This is a beheading from afar... Frieren Scharfrichter!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> As the rider deflects every one of the goat and snake&#39;s strikes, the wolf&#39;s blade bites through the lion&#39;s neck before its fangs can pierce their prey.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> In a flash, the battle is over. All that remains is an eerie silence, and the stench of blood.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The wolf makes not a sound as he glares at the Demonic Beast&#39;s carcass.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> He feels neither happy nor sad. Only the slightest pang of sentimentality.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Guys!</p><hr><p><strong>Narration:</strong> His Master runs over to him.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> [\u2642 He /\u2640\uFE0F She} stumbles with every other step, yet [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she} still hurries as though [\u2642 his /\u2640\uFE0F her} life depends on it.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1AHessian Lobo:</strong> !</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The wolf sighs, as if to say, \u201CYou really should be more careful.\u201D</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Thank you.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The wolf accepts this praise with a snort.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;m glad you&#39;re okay.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The wolf turns away, as if to say, \u201CIt was nothing, really.\u201D</p><hr><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...He then lazily turns his attention skyward.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Neither the moonlight nor the stars&#39; twinkling suit him anymore.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The only thing that suits him now is the vivid neon lights of man-made cities from the forest&#39;s shadows.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The wolf smiles, content in that notion.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Even if he can never return to those plains, he cannot let their memory die.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> This he can never permit.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So why did he answer my summons?</p><hr><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong> ...For his descendants, apparently.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong> Lobo and Blanca had cubs, you see.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong> If they were lucky, they may have survived and grown into adults.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong> It&#39;s possible they went on to grow their numbers, leave America, and head for another country.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong> Though of course, it is only a possibility. Whether it is even probable, well...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong> Truth be told, it&#39;s more likely that his bloodline died out a long time ago.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> Even if it is unlikely, it&#39;s still at least possible.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong> And who says wolves can&#39;t dream!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The wolf dreams of something that can never be.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> He dreams of himself, Blanca, and his beloved cubs, all joyously running across the plains together.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> It&#39;s a foolish dream. It may only serve to make him miserable.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> But, even if that dream can never be...there is no reason he cannot wish for it anyway.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> So he will believe in his dream, and die for it if he must.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> That is why he answered the summons. He needed no other reason.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> That is why he protects the weak, fragile human leaning against him.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The wolf howls at the moon, thinking back to his time in the plains.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The path ahead of him is long and winding, but the Wolf King continues to walk it without hesitation.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Then, a thought occurs to him.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The weight of his Master leaning against him now...reminds him of how his cubs used to snuggle so innocently against him.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> So he will continue on.
