He couldn&#39;t be a Berserker then, could he...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> He can understand us?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> To be honest, it seems that way.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes...

It still has our lunches on it! Senpai, watch out!</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png" alt="berserk2">\u2013!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Lancelot!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> He used the chopsticks\u2013 to stop the attack... That&#39;s amazing...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So that&#39;s the skill of the Knight of Owner. Bravo, Lancelot!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> But those chopsticks won&#39;t hold out for long!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Can he use something else as a weapon?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I think we need to get Mash&#39;s shield...</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Foou!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Huh? ...What did you find, Fou? That&#39;s a log! Well done, Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Take it, Lancelot!</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png" alt="berserk2">\u2013!!!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Whoa!

Lancelot, your log\u2014</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s bashed to bits. A new log for you!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Thank goodness there&#39;s a forest nearby!</p><hr><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png" alt="berserk2">\u2013!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> H-He seems upset! Master, it seems as if he&#39;s had it with logs, and wants a real weapon!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Whew... Somehow, we fought them off. You were a great help, Lancelot!</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Knight of Owner... I see. But, can logs and chopsticks be counted as weapons?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;ve heard of a great swordsman in ancient Japan who used chopsticks to defeat an insect-like monster, so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s unusual.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Wow, you sure know a lot...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Was that Musashi?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. But even then, they wouldn&#39;t work as weapons without Lancelot&#39;s unparallel abilities.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png" alt="berserk1">!!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> What?

See, he&#39;s always wearing that helmet, right? Don&#39;t you want to see what&#39;s under there?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yes, I totally do.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> He&#39;s probably quite handsome.</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Foou?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> You&#39;ll have to admit, Lancelot is the ideal image of a knight! He&#39;s the most popular Heroic Spirit among the ladies in this world.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Haa... But how can we get his helmet off?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Plan A: A slip of the hand during battle! All right, let&#39;s give it a try!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Now then, I&#39;m going to start the battle simulation program. Is everybody ready?</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (I feel really bad about tricking him...) ...Got it, Doctor. I&#39;m ready any time.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The enemy&#39;s a simulated Servant used for trainings, so it&#39;s not dangerous. Don&#39;t worry.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> (I&#39;m going to set the parameters at the highest, though.)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Let&#39;s begin, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> All right! Let&#39;s do our best!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Am I supposed to slip and pull his helmet off?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai! Shhh! Shhh!</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png" alt="berserk2">\u2013!!!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png" alt="berserk2">\u2013!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Th-That was excellent... (It&#39;s no good. He doesn&#39;t leave any openings during or after battle!)</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> (He truly is the Knight of the Lake!) Is he really under Madness Enhancement?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That must be his famous &quot;Eternal Arms Mastery.&quot;</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Even under Madness Enhancement, his combat skills will never deteriorate.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> We&#39;re not through yet! Don&#39;t give up, Mash! The next Shadow Servant will be incredible!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> (Hahaha, I&#39;m gonna rig the settings.) (Even the Knight of the Lake won&#39;t be able to...)</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...Oops.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um... Doctor, what is this?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Sorry, I messed up. I might&#39;ve summoned an extremely powerful mock Servant.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Oopsie Daisy?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I saw this coming.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Oopsie daisy my butt!</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Foou!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Oh, just FYI. This Shadow Servant might cost you your lives...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Doctor?!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> D-Do your best!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;ll make you pay for this later, got it? Anyway, let&#39;s take care of this Lancelot!</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7VYgcEB.png" alt="berserk2">\u2013!!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> W-We won...just barely.</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> He made that fight look like a walk in the park... The Knight of the Lake... What a guy...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Foou...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So, remind me why we&#39;re doing this.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I just want to go back to my room...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Sheesh, it&#39;s all because the Doctor wanted to see Lancelot&#39;s face, that&#39;s why we... Oops.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Mash?</p><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I-I&#39;m sorry...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Sorry, but we&#39;re really curious...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Come on and just show us!</p><hr><p><strong>Lancelot:</strong> ...!!!

I think this is the effect of &quot;For Someone&#39;s Glory.&quot;</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The skill that conceals his status and appearance, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But still, even this close with his helmet off, I still can&#39;t see a thing...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> All this has made me...so tired.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What a disappointment!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Let&#39;s go back and eat...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Y-Yeah, let&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Well, talk about a waste of time.
