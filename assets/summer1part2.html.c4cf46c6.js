Yoo-hoo.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> It&#39;s been a long trip. About two weeks, I reckon.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> More like three days?

Care to massage me?\u266A</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Quite persistent, wasn&#39;t it. It was on a completely different level than the other demon boars we&#39;ve met so far.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Just like the giant demon boars from the other island, it was a monster that reached the level of a Phantasmal.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Normally it should only be found on the reverse side of the world, or it would have long been extinct.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> But it&#39;s here in this world, and it&#39;s building strength.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Is it possible that this island is isolated from everywhere else?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> There are plenty of heroes who have seen the whole world.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> And a greedy mage would never ignore a land with demonic beasts of this rank wandering around.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> ...In that case, the possibilities are narrowed down for us. Now, let&#39;s walk a bit further.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Wait a second. The demon boar was protecting this tree.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Shouldn&#39;t we investigate it before we\u2014</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> There&#39;s no need. That&#39;s an ash tree.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...What?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Now let&#39;s go. If it&#39;s still intact, it shouldn&#39;t have weathered away.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Huh? Wait... Wait a minute! Could it actually be...me?</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> ...It is! This...is me!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> This is Marie&#39;s statue? In that case\u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh? Wait a minute...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This old, broken stone statue is the one we built on the other island, right!?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou...?</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> ...Oh! I get it now!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Well done. You are quick on the uptake, Marie.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Mash, this isn&#39;t an inextricable mystery.

As expected from our Master.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> It&#39;s true that we&#39;ve solved the mystery of this island, but as to how we escape it...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Well, I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be fine. We&#39;ll find a way out as we solve more mysteries.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> At any rate, this world has been cut off from \u201Cour world\u201D for 2,000 years now.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> No heroes or mages existed here.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> It was just a world where the boar piglets lived in peace.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> But then the intruders came.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That would be us...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Correct.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> I see.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> We lived on that island and established a civilization, and so the boar piglets awakened to that concept as well.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> ...However, isn&#39;t their civilization a little too advanced?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> It is, yes. That&#39;s also something worth thinking about...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Anyway, over the course of 2,000 years, the boar piglets built up an advanced civilization on this island.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> They must have taken good care of that statue too. We built it, after all.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> They worked so hard! I&#39;ll have to praise them later!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> If Marie praises them, I am sure they will all be quite pleased.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou fou.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, Fou always manages to give us courage.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Foumu.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Okay, let&#39;s head back for now.

Protein&#39;s the best!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That&#39;s not healthy.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> Doesn&#39;t matter. A Servant&#39;s very existence is unhealthy.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Well, you do have a point there. ...So are you our enemy? Or are you our foe?</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> I&#39;m obviously not your ally! I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the influence of poison or alcohol, but...</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> I am itching to take over this world!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Take over this world?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou?</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> Anyway, I&#39;ll grab my prey and take my leave!

Either way, we are done here.</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Let&#39;s go back and eat. All that hunting has made me hungry... Just like a human.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, let&#39;s head back for now.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Demon boars, the mysterious civilization of the boar piglets, the fact that we can&#39;t Rayshift...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> And now, the appearance of a hostile Servant...

At least that is what I believe.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> \u201CEstablished\u201D? Don&#39;t you mean \u201Cassumed\u201D?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Wasn&#39;t it your stiff thinking that made that dolt Lancelot cause so much trouble?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Mordred, shush! Don&#39;t say that!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou fooou!</p><p><strong>Demon Boar:</strong> (How long is this going to go on?)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Sorry, let&#39;s get ready!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> I apologize for getting so worked up earlier.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> No, it&#39;s I who must apologize for my ill-mannered behavior towards a king.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> I didn&#39;t do anything wrong!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh please, Mordred...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yeah, Mordred didn&#39;t do anything wrong.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Huh? What&#39;re you talking about? I did everything wrong!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Right. Yep, you&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Wh-What&#39;s with that look? Sheesh. Fine, it was my bad!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> I&#39;m sorry!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (...Ah, I get it...)</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou fou.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> ...Anyway, let&#39;s move on. Mordred, as punishment you will do 100,000 pushups as soon as we get back.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Yes, my lord! Hooray, that&#39;s 900,000 less than usual!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fou.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Hm? An...earthquake?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The earth is shaking. This is\u2014</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Wh-What the heck is this music!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Is it...a gramophone!?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Hah hah hah! Hah hah hah!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Fwahah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This laugh... It&#39;s almost like this person practiced and perfected their laugh for this exact moment!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Hmm, I feel like I have heard it somewhere before...!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Who goes there? Show yourself!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Hah. I would very much like to show myself to you all!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> However, I must confirm whether you are the ones I was waiting for!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Witness in awe the strength of this great king!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Detecting an unknown Servant and multiple enemies around us! Let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>???:</strong> Fantastic! What a wonderful display of strength! Although I would say strength isn&#39;t everything!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Anyway, having gotten an idea of your true ability, I suppose there&#39;s no harm in revealing myself to you now!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Enough talk, just come out already.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Servants, how I waited for this moment! Now I shall bestow my wisdom upon you!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I am a Caster. People call me the Wizard of Menlo Park!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The Wizard of Menlo Park... I knew it!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> I am Thomas Alva Edison, the Presi-king!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Oh man, here we go again...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s all clear now. If this man sets his mind to it, civilization would indeed develop at a very rapid pace...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> So it wasn&#39;t Tesla.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong></p><p>No, Master!!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> There is no way a ruffian like that could help the boar piglets evolve properly!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> They were successful because of me! It is important you understand! Attention!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> (A lion...fluffy...bushy mane...fluffy)</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> (Father&#39;s giving him a sharp look... I get it. Being on guard in front of a fellow king! Impressive, Father!)</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> Well then, what has become of the boar piglets&#39; civilization?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> I reckon they&#39;ve reached a level at which they can casually exchange high-speed communications with the outside world!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> It&#39;s in ruins.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> Nooooooooooooooooooo!!!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> I-It really is destroyed! Welcome to a crazy time, eh!?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> Oh, how terrible! Even after I had passed all my modern knowledge on to them!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It must be rough on you...</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> To think those monstrous demon boars would reduce it to rubble... I&#39;ll never forgive them!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> I&#39;ll send every single one of them to the meatpacking factory and end world hunger!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> The heck!? He&#39;s so scary!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> It&#39;s frightening to know that you are quite capable of doing so. Anyway, Edison, I&#39;m amazed you&#39;re alive.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> Yes. My deep insight allowed me to predict that in 100 years, you Nine Sisters would come here...</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> And that you would need my help to escape this island.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> Thus, by utilizing all the available technology at that time...</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> I completed the Edison Cryosleep Device, set the Edison Gramophone Alarm Clock,</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> and waited until my awakening!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So you hibernated.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> Cryosleep! I was in cryosleep!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> I understand the big picture now.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> However, it is quite difficult to believe you are Edison. Your look differs from the pictures we have seen.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> Humph. I get that quite often. But it&#39;s true: I am, in fact, Edison.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> (Father tries to confirm everything personally. As expected...)</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Allow me to confirm. Hmm. (Snuggle, squeeze)</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> Oomph, I didn&#39;t expect my face to be pulled... Ah, oww, that hurts! Wait!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> (Snuggle, snuggle, squeeze, squeeze, snuggle, snuggle, squeeze, squeeze, snuggle, snuggle, squeeze, squeeze)</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> Stop, stop, you&#39;re pulling my fur out!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Altria, you are going too far! S-Someone stop her!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> (Wow, Father...!)</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> Hah hah hah! We meet again, my friends!</p><p><strong>G\uFF1ABoar Piglet:</strong> Salute!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1ABoar Piglet:</strong> So he&#39;s the Lion Ki\u2013</p><p><strong>E\uFF1ABoar Piglet:</strong> Don&#39;t finish that sentence, yup.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> Hah hah! I see you&#39;re as incoherent as ever!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> Well, what shall I build you? I have the power to build anything and everything!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Actually, first off, we will have you find a way for us to return to Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> Right! But I need a certain item for that purpose!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A certain item?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> Nothing special. Most of you should have it in your possession.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What is it?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> Yes... It is somewhere on this island...</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> The Holy Grail!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The Holy Grail...!?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!!</p><h2 id="section-6-the-mechanical-beast-roars" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-6-the-mechanical-beast-roars" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 6: &quot;The Mechanical Beast Roars&quot;</h2><p><strong>Edison:</strong> The Holy Grail!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The Holy Grail...!?</p><p><strong>C\uFF1ABoar Piglet:</strong> That&#39;s what happened in the last episode, yup!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ABoar Piglet:</strong> A lot happened during that time!</p><p><strong>H\uFF1ABoar Piglet:</strong> But we omitted most of the details, yup!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Hmm, the Holy Grail, huh? What a tall order...</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> Huh? You don&#39;t have it with you?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> It&#39;s not something you can just carry around.</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> It&#39;s supposed to be a precious object one can only obtain at the end of a long, grueling Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> Hmm, this is problematic.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> Without the vast magical energy that it possesses, we won&#39;t be able to establish communication with Chaldea...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Is there a Holy Grail somewhere on this island?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> Yes! No doubt about it!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> However, I don&#39;t know who has it. It&#39;s either with a Servant somewhere or...</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong> The Holy Grail!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1ABoar Piglet:</strong> Only one group survives, yup!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1ABoar Piglet:</strong> That&#39;s deflation, yup.</p><p><strong>H\uFF1ABoar Piglet:</strong> In a way, it&#39;s inflation, too, yup.</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet Chief:</strong> Be quiet for a bit, younglings. We don&#39;t have any information on the Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet Chief:</strong> If we had something amazing like that, we would&#39;ve used it long ago.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> Yes, I imagine you would have used it to get rid of the demon boars.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> ...Which means it&#39;s safe to say that the demon boars themselves have it.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> 50 years ago, demon boars suddenly appeared in great numbers. We can assume it had something to do with the Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> That is indeed logical!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> But the question is, which demon boar has it?</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> I suppose we&#39;ll just have to search all of them, one boar at a time.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> What a pain.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> You must start small and chip away diligently.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> In fact, I&#39;ve been sneaking into your room and doing just that, Master. All in order to conquer you in bed.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Every night...</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Now, now. Calm down, Master.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll protect your bed.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Hmmm...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That&#39;s no small start, that&#39;s the finish line.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Not at all, Master. Why, even dying together would only be the halfway point...</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> After that, we will reincarnate again and again, holding on to our memories, and we shall witness the extinction of the cosmos together. That would be the end.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> (Sheesh. There&#39;s no such thing as reincarnation, but I&#39;ll let that go. Objecting would overcomplicate things.)</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Anyway, I have some idea where the demon boars&#39; lair might be.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> I expect they&#39;ll have a large army, so we should make careful preparations. Then we all head out together.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Well, isn&#39;t this a crowd...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> That&#39;s fine, but how long are all of you going to remain in swimsuits? ...Hey, don&#39;t turn away.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> \u2014Anyway, come, let&#39;s prepare (read: charge into battle).</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Umm... I feel like someone mistyped the text...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> No, that was correct. I am asking everyone to get ready (read: leave no survivors).</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> All right, who will go first?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> For me, a battle royale between everyone would be ideal...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Let&#39;s go in order. All right, let the training begin!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Why...did I get roped into this...?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> Never mind you. I don&#39;t have anything to do with this. Urgh.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> All right, now that Edison has warmed up with some light exercise too, shall we be off?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Yes!</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> Hey, old man lion. Time to go.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> This kind of exercise is too hard for someone with E-rank strength...</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> But you&#39;ve got such a fine physique...</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> I&#39;m more brains than brawn, after all!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> ...Hmm.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This is...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Sc\xE1thach. It seems your speculation was correct.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> There are too many of them. It is solid proof that something must lie ahead.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Indeed. However, our number puts us at a disadvantage out here in the open.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Hah! This is easy.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> I&#39;ll charge and tear into their front lines, giving time for Master and Mash to slip through.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Everyone else just needs to beat down whatever&#39;s left. Simple as that!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Let&#39;s go with Mordred&#39;s plan. Sc\xE1thach, please go with them.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Anyone else?</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> It pains me to be separated from my Master, but we have no choice.</p><p><strong>Kiyohime:</strong> Listen, when you get back, you better spend all your time with me!</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Aye, I understand my role. Don&#39;t worry, I was good at buying time even when I was alive.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> That&#39;s right. Besides, it doesn&#39;t look like anyone here would run away from a fight, so that&#39;s reassuring.</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Yes. We&#39;ll make all these demon boars here repent for their sins, so you two just go on ahead.</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Exactly. Fujimaru, Mash... Give it all you&#39;ve got! Do it for those adorable little piglets!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> Well, defensive battles aren&#39;t really my forte, but... Okay, fine! Truly shining at times like this is what being a stunning woman is all about!</p><p><strong>Tamamo-no-Mae:</strong> So, Master. Go pulverize them!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Come on, there&#39;s nothing to worry about! If that idiotic\u2013I mean, if Lady Sc\xE1thach is with you then everything will be fine!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> (That was a close one! Too close!)</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> (No, it most certainly was not.)</p><p><strong>C\xFA Chulainn:</strong> I feel like I drew the short end of the stick on this island! Ah, well... Let&#39;s do this!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> I shall accompany you. I don&#39;t think I have anything useful to add to that lineup.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> Instead, I&#39;ll be more helpful in the search for the Holy Grail!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> All right, then it&#39;s settled! Let me break through with my Noble Phantasm!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Noble Phantasm deployed... \u201CPrydwen Tube Riding\u201D!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> Yes! I opened a path!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Go ahead, Master! We&#39;ll take care of the horde!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Let&#39;s charge!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Roger that, Master! Mash Kyrielight, rushing into the fray!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Thank you, everyone!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong> No thanks necessary! Now get going!</p><p><strong>Martha:</strong> Give them hell!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> All right, let&#39;s keep moving ahead!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I hear the sound of Noble Phantasms firing off behind us!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> Which means they&#39;re pulling out all the stops! (Panting)</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Edison, you&#39;re falling behind.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> S-Sorry. I&#39;ve got E-rank agility too!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I thought your endurance was EX.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> That EX rank refers to my ability to go sleepless for days while working on an invention!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> In other words, you don&#39;t have the physical strength to run a marathon! Anyway, hurry!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> I-I&#39;m trying! (Panting)</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> Damn it! Next time I will invent a powered exoskeleton to assist people with weak stamina!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> It&#39;s a giant demon boar! We&#39;d better slay it swiftly! We don&#39;t have time for a drawn-out battle!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Where are we?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> The odor of oil, steel, and adhesive... Without a doubt, this place is a factory!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> But what are they building here?</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong> ...Me.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> ...Who goes there?</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong> It&#39;s been a while.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong> ...No, I am sure it&#39;s only been an instant to you vermin.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong> However, to me, it&#39;s been hell.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh? Altria!?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> ...No. She smells like oil and steel too.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> King Arthur wouldn&#39;t give off a modern odor like that.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AAltria?:</strong> ...You are correct.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AAltria?:</strong> This is a form I plan to use when I destroy those boars.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AAltria?:</strong> They will welcome me as their savior, obey my every word... and then accept their own destruction with joy.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AAltria?:</strong> Vengeance... Vengeance 2,000 years in the making will come to fruition here.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> ...I see. So that&#39;s who you are.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> You&#39;re the demon boar we defeated 2,000 years ago, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...The very first giant demon boar!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> So, eons ago, these people vanquished you and put an end to your dastardly deeds...</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> But you managed to survive and have been biding your time ever since, plotting your revenge...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> It&#39;s been too long. If that much time has passed, you are\u2014</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AAltria?:</strong> That&#39;s right, I am like you. However, I have reached the realm of a divine beast.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> D-Divine beast!?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> It&#39;s nothing to be surprised about.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> On this land overflowing with magical energy, he used the Holy Grail to survive for 2,000 years.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> It&#39;s entirely possible that he did, in fact, attain divine beast status.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> He&#39;s taken this form in retaliation against the person who defeated him long ago. Isn&#39;t that right, Twrch Trwyth!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Twrch Trwyth!? From King Arthur&#39;s legends?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Yes, the King of Demon Boars. One who transformed into a boar and ate his way across Britain with his seven piglets.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Hmph. To think you drifted all the way to a land like this...</p><p><strong>Twrch Trwyth:</strong> ...I was once defeated by Arthur, King of Knights. But that brat did not consider me a formidable enemy.</p><p><strong>Twrch Trwyth:</strong> He should have treated me like a fellow king... But no!</p><p><strong>Twrch Trwyth:</strong> It&#39;s like I was a mere rodent to him the entire time! He bested me and drove me right out of the realm!</p><p><strong>Twrch Trwyth:</strong> All just to save the suffering, and to retrieve my giant razor, scissors, and comb!</p><p><strong>Twrch Trwyth:</strong> I could never forget such humiliation, even after 2,000 or even 3,000 years!</p><p><strong>Twrch Trwyth:</strong> I wandered all over and finally ended up on this island. I embraced the Holy Grail and, by doing so, became a behemoth fit to be a divine beast.</p><p><strong>Twrch Trwyth:</strong> In other words, I became Twrch Trwyth...!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> A mecha!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> Good god! He survived for 2,000 years by turning himself into a machine!?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> Using the power of the Holy Grail, he forced himself to live even when he was supposed to be destroyed...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...Is he even alive?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Half alive and half dead.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> His death-like visage comes from his attachment to living. He has fallen into the oblivion between both.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Either way, I never thought I would encounter a legendary demonic beast in a place like this!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We will not let you disrupt the lives of the boar piglets. We will defeat you, right here, right now!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Let&#39;s go, Master! Your orders, please!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Twrch Trwyth:</strong> ...My seven sons. ...My glory. My kingdom. My people.</p><p><strong>Twrch Trwyth:</strong> Everything... Everything is gone. Even my body.</p><p><strong>Twrch Trwyth:</strong> I&#39;ve come all this way. I&#39;ve made it this far.</p><p><strong>Twrch Trwyth:</strong> So then why must I\u2014</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> It&#39;s simple. It is your fate.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> You rampaged, stole, devoured, killed, gloated, and had your way with everything.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Even after being punished and turned into a boar, that didn&#39;t change at all.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> ...So it&#39;s only natural that you&#39;d be trapped here for 2,000 years. Just as it&#39;s only natural that you&#39;d die here too.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> That was your fate from the moment you first decided to steal.</p><p><strong>Twrch Trwyth:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Do not hate us, Twrch Trwyth! That would be a pathetic end for one who became a divine beast.</p><p><strong>Twrch Trwyth:</strong> I see... Now that you mention it... Looking back...</p><p><strong>Twrch Trwyth:</strong> I suppose it was... only natural.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master, it&#39;s gone. We&#39;ve won.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> And the Holy Grail has manifested as well. Let me get it.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> We can use this power to finally leave.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> Yes. Leave the rest to me. I&#39;ll take care of everything!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong> D-Don&#39;t worry, Fou. It&#39;s okay.

Ahem.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Well, that&#39;s fine.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> There&#39;s something I have to confess. When I put this on, I altered my Spirit Origin, remember?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> ...I forgot.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Huh?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> I have COMPLETELY, 100% forgotten how to change it back!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> In other words, even after we go back, I&#39;ll still be wearing this swimsuit.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> But what you just said was reassuring. If my Master says so, I have no choice.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> I&#39;ll fight in this outfit all year long! ...What? I&#39;m a Servant, I don&#39;t catch colds.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> I&#39;ll fight like this in a blizzard!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> ...What&#39;s wrong, Master?

Never again will lost adventurers wind up here. We&#39;ll be the last.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Will it become a paradise?

If it were humans living here, though, that&#39;d be a different story.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> After all, the piglets never developed any weapons\u2013regardless of how advanced their civilization became.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> As long as there are no foreign invaders lying in wait, I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll live in peace.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> ...Don&#39;t tell the others, but just in case, I left an Oblivion Rune down there on the island.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> The boar piglets will someday forget their civilization, forget their language, and live an easy life as wild beasts.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Will they really be okay?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> ...One can only hope.

Let&#39;s try to make a new spear with it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A spear...?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> G\xE1e Bolg was made from the bones of a sea monster. It would be difficult to replicate that on this island.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> But I can make something that&#39;s extremely similar using the power of my runes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> With this ash tree?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Ash trees are descendants of the Norse world tree, Yggdrasil. And Yggdrasil is where the runes themselves come from.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> So if I borrow as much power as possible from this ash tree, then use my runes...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You&#39;ll have more G\xE1e Bolgs?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Exactly! One spear per ash tree!</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> Even from a non-crafter like myself, they should still be formidable.

An increase in Noble Phantasm strength.</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> ...Anyway, I&#39;ll be pouring my heart and soul into this work, and in the meantime, I&#39;d like you guys to stand guard.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Uh, stand guard?</p><p><strong>Sc\xE1thach:</strong> I&#39;ll be crafting this spear all day and all night.

I&#39;m a king, but I&#39;m also just a Servant.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Master, if I could become a partner you can build a trusting relationship with... That would be truly wonderful.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I-I&#39;m here too! I think you can have that kind of relationship with three people!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I mean, I may be a Demi-Servant, so strictly speaking, um...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> That&#39;s right. You&#39;re here too, Mash.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Now, let&#39;s work together, like partners, so that we don&#39;t let the other side beat us!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We&#39;re in an open area! This is...</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> Oh my...</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Oh, I guess it connected to the same place.</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> Who got here first?</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> It was us, right?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Wait. The tip of my gun entered this space first. The victor is clear as day.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (She really is competitive...)</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> The deciding factor has to be whose body entered first. And since I jumped forward, that means my\u2013</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Tch!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> F-Forget that! Look over there!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!</p><p><strong>Boar Piglet:</strong> Piggy!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> A poisonous swamp at the back of the cave!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, and\u2013</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> There&#39;s two of them!</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Oh... The boar piglets probably remembered both of their scents. That&#39;s how we got here.</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> They&#39;re coming... We&#39;ll have to fight both of them together, but we should be able to handle them!</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> No problem. We can do it.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Of course, I&#39;ll fight too!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Time for some teamwork!</p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> Hehe. You&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. Let&#39;s show them the power of partnership!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> I guess you remembered.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s right. The demon boars ran off during the battle.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Right. We couldn&#39;t bring things to an end, but they stopped using this cave as a home, and peace was restored.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Does that mean there&#39;s nothing left in this cave?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> No, not at all... In fact, it looks like our 2,000-year-old battle is about to resume!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Demon boars...?</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AAnne?:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>H\uFF1AMary?:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You two...?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Fou, I know. Those two are not them.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Anne Bonny. Mary Read.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> ...They took their forms, then?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> They kept the memory of their defeat, and now they&#39;ve managed to recreate it.</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> But...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> They didn&#39;t copy you, Altria.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master... Don&#39;t say that!</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> That&#39;s right. Absolutely right. Why not me?</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Those two pirates count as one Servant. Were they chosen because of their number?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Altria may not look it, but she&#39;s actually one of the most powerful Servants of all...</p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Demon boars, you&#39;re about to learn that you made a fatal mistake!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> She really is competitive!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Altria:</strong> Okay, Master!
