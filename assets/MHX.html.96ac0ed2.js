Even though you&#39;re a Voloid. You&#39;re really an odd one.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> Did you, just, intercept some funny transmission? That&#39;s, no good.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> There may be a time when I&#39;ll have to rely on you during battle. Maybe.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> Yeah, but...I guess I don&#39;t really have room to talk about spacing out.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (...Voloid?)</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> ...Hm? Dumpling?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> You want a dumpling? I just ate it. That dumpling.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> But, you know\u2014</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (What battle...?)</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> ...

Your train of thought&#39;s gone off the rails.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> Your conversational protocol&#39;s also been strange. Maybe I need to check for crossed wires.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> It&#39;s unfortunate, but it looks like we&#39;re going to be apart from each other for a while.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> Is it this...circuit here...

No matter what kind of desolate star it may be.</p><p><strong>Agravain:</strong> That is unnecessary. There is another job better suited to your skills.</p><p><strong>Agravain:</strong> Alter. Guided by the Alternium, the prophesied child of destruction...</p><p><strong>Agravain:</strong> A Berserker formed using the X Factor as a catalyst...</p><p><strong>Agravain:</strong> A crystal of Alternium is hidden within your body, and you are granted the Ultimate Anti-Anti-Saber Weapon.</p><p><strong>Agravain:</strong> In this region of space, few know of you. That fact will aid us as we prepare to strike back.</p><p><strong>Agravain:</strong> Our fellow lords have all fallen and been sealed away. The only one left is me\u2014</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> I am still here, Master. I, Alter, your own disciple.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> I shall not let the sacrifice of our great lord of Villains be in vain.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> My Mana Conversion Altereactor Engine is burning furiously, ready to defeat our sworn enemy, Heroine X.</p><p><strong>Agravain:</strong> ...Alter. What I am about to tell you is of the utmost importance. Carve it deep into your heart. Also, write it down on a piece of paper so you do not forget.</p><p><strong>Agravain:</strong> You are going to go in hiding, and go on a journey alone.</p><p><strong>Agravain:</strong> You are the final hope of Dark R.O.U.N.D.S. Or something like that.</p><p><strong>Agravain:</strong> We must focus on the opportunity to realize our wish, while we work, obscure, from the shadows.</p><p><strong>Agravain:</strong> We must sink into the muck, and become a slumbering dragon. For such a task, I would only be in your way.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> That... No...</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> What are you talking about? That doesn&#39;t make sense. It&#39;s incomprehensible, like a wet piece of toast smothered in jam.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> Are you trying to distance yourself from me, Master? Please allow me to stay by your side. I cannot live alone.</p><p><strong>Agravain:</strong> I will not repeat myself. You need to find a proper job.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> ...Ugh...</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> Does that mean we&#39;re no longer going to communicate?</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> ...!?</p><p><strong>Agravain:</strong> Hm...</p><p><strong>Agravain:</strong> ...That steam noise. I could never forget that sound.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> ..Babbagen! That tin can running on steam has managed to reach our castle!</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> That thing is truly the mortal enemy of all Villains. I shall slice it down with my dark sword!</p><p><strong>Agravain:</strong> Evil Sacred Sword Necro-calibur... That blade shall one day cut through even a planet.</p><p><strong>Agravain:</strong> But it still hasn&#39;t fully matured. We were foolish to believe in the specs written in the catalog. Honestly, internet shopping...</p><p><strong>Agravain:</strong> No, that&#39;s not what I mean. We did not have enough time to provide you with all that is necessary.</p><p><strong>Agravain:</strong> Learn, Alter. Go to a new land and search for a superior Master.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> I...I have yet to reward the enemy with a single blade of mine.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> I have put none of Master&#39;s teachings into practice.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> ... (Gasp) Master...what are you\u2014</p><p><strong>Agravain:</strong> Alter. I am sealing away your memories.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> ...Ungh...ahhh...</p><p><strong>Agravain:</strong> This is the hidden skill called \u201CBlack Knight&#39;s Black Hand.\u201D All who call themselves knights are shackled down by the rules of example.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> That&#39;s your favorite pestering Noble Phantasm, isn&#39;t it? But the Black Knight and Black Hand seem redundant.</p><p><strong>Agravain:</strong> ...Just ignore the minute details, okay?</p><p><strong>Agravain:</strong> This skill shall take effect a few days from now. You will forget my name, as well.</p><p><strong>Agravain:</strong> Go, Alter.</p><p><strong>Agravain:</strong> You are Servant Universe&#39;s strongest and final Alter, and that truth shall be hidden from all.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> ...Master...</p><p><strong>Agravain:</strong> There&#39;s no need to be sad as we part with the promise of victory.

At any cost! Black Knight, I need your help!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (Got it!)</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> What a cute response. It&#39;s like you&#39;re not Black Knight.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> Target the memory banks! No records shall be left!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (Something seems wrong here... She just said Villain...)</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> Yep, Villain. It means enemy. Huh? Are you complaining again?</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> Just because one&#39;s an enemy, that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean they&#39;re a bad guy. Just like how the hero may not always be a good guy.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> But what&#39;s important right now is that we need to fight or else it&#39;s game over. Let&#39;s go!</p><hr><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> ...Breaking away from Planet Lothian&#39;s gravitational pull.

I&#39;m going in and out of consciousness...)</p><hr><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> Are you all right?</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> I was pretty sloppy erasing your confidential data, so maybe that&#39;s why you&#39;re acting funny.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> Agravain...my lord...

I thought they were just stingy with the heating...</p><p><strong>X:</strong> But this alone is praiseworthy! On the other hand, red bean buns taste like corruption!</p><p><strong>X:</strong> One more... Hey! This is a red bean bun! Why that guy at Vamily Mart!</p><p><strong>X:</strong> ...Hmm? I sense a Saber approaching!</p><p><strong>X:</strong> You there! You, in the sailor uniform, standing there mysteriously! Yes, you!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>X:</strong> What? I&#39;m not giving you one even if you stare at it!</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Who are you? I don&#39;t know you, but you look familiar! This is mind-boggling!</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Are you a Saber!? If you are, then you&#39;re gonna get blown away!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>X:</strong> ...Hm? Are you cold? And hungry? Your knees are shaking... Do you have altitude sickness?</p><p><strong>X:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>X:</strong> I guess I have no choice. Consider yourself lucky you&#39;re not a Saber. And just one. You can only take one.</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Come on, hold out your hand. Whoa! It&#39;s so cold!</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong> ... (Munch...munch...)</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong> ...So sweet...and warm...</p><p><strong>X:</strong> ...You must have been hungry. Well, I&#39;m not sure that even counts as a good deed.</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Out in the vastness of space, I hear there&#39;s even a hero who lets you eat his head. Could he be from the cosmic horror genre?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong> Where...am I...?</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Did you come here without knowing?</p><p><strong>X:</strong> You&#39;re at Cosmo-Chaldea High School. It&#39;s a school attended by many young students who dream of becoming tomorrow&#39;s SSR Servants.</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong> Cosmo...Chaldea High...?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong> I heard of a place around here with a ton of elite Masters, but I guess this isn&#39;t it.</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Master? There are plenty of annoying teachers.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong> You&#39;ve ditched class to eat out, X?</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Oh crap, Lionhead!</p><p><strong>God Bless Edison:</strong> I am not currently known as Lionhead! I am God Bless Edison! GBE!</p><p><strong>God Bless Edison:</strong> I am the very first principal of the glorious Cosmo-Chaldea High!</p><p><strong>X:</strong> You don&#39;t have to roar so, cathead. I can hear you. I get it.</p><p><strong>X:</strong> I just bumped into someone who I guess is a transfer student. I was about to give her a tour.</p><p><strong>God Bless Edison:</strong> A noble effort, but you still owe me 50,000 super gravity squats.</p><p><strong>God Bless Edison:</strong> So this is her? Hm, I did not receive any word about a transfer student...</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Hey. What&#39;s your name, by the way?</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong> My...name...</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong> ...Ex...</p><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong> ...Ex...ah...</p><p><strong>X:</strong> \u201CEx\u201D? Is it just \u201CEx\u201D? What a short name!</p><p><strong>God Bless Edison:</strong> Look who&#39;s talking.</p><p><strong>X:</strong> I like it. It&#39;s short and sweet! All right, Ex!</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong> Ah...yes... That&#39;s...fine.</p><p><strong>God Bless Edison:</strong> Very well. Ex.</p><p><strong>God Bless Edison:</strong> I know you must want to enroll in this school, but it doesn&#39;t accept just anybody.</p><p><strong>God Bless Edison:</strong> It&#39;s a school where heroic Servants are raised by experienced, active Servants working as teachers.</p><p><strong>God Bless Edison:</strong> Thus, those who wish to enroll must have certain qualifications!</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong> ...Qualifications...?</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Don&#39;t be stupid, principal! You were just complaining that the school is in the red because there were so many dropouts from the tough curriculum!</p><p><strong>God Bless Edison:</strong> Those are separate issues! As different as AC and DC!</p><p><strong>X:</strong> I see. So, there&#39;s not much difference.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong> ...I want...to enroll. I want to become a great Servant.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong> I&#39;ll make the tuition thing work. So...please...</p><p><strong>God Bless Edison:</strong> It seems like your words are sincere. You have passed the first entrance exam.</p><p><strong>God Bless Edison:</strong> And while we&#39;re here. X, you be her opponent.</p><p><strong>God Bless Edison:</strong> We&#39;ll hold a mock battle. Based on the result of that, I shall judge whether you can enroll or not!</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Okay... It seems wrong that a student is in charge of testing another student, but I guess this is just what comes with being an upperclassman. I&#39;ll do it.</p><p><strong>X:</strong> ...Heh. In other words, a part-time job with the school principal&#39;s full permission. I&#39;ll get at least a week&#39;s worth of lunch vouchers out of this!</p><p><strong>God Bless Edison:</strong> No. If anything, this is a secret deal. You do know that buying food from outside vendors is prohibited.</p><p><strong>God Bless Edison:</strong> I&#39;ll turn a blind eye to it if you win. Also, if you lose to her, I will double your tuition.</p><p><strong>God Bless Edison:</strong> Do you think that&#39;s unreasonable? No, call me a capitalistic gentleman! It just means you&#39;re going to be paying for her tuition as well!</p><p><strong>X:</strong> So you&#39;re saying that whatever the outcome, the school won&#39;t lose anything, AND will gain another student!</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Why you, what a sharp way of thinking! It&#39;s hard to believe you&#39;re a lion. Are you by chance human!?</p><p><strong>God Bless Edison:</strong> I keep telling you I&#39;m a human! Not having any toe beans is proof!</p><p><strong>God Bless Edison:</strong> Ah, no, that&#39;s not what I mean. Ex...</p><p><strong>God Bless Edison:</strong> X may act rowdy like she does, ditch classes, and sometimes battle active Servants...</p><p><strong>God Bless Edison:</strong> ...but she is still our star pupil. She&#39;s pretty strong. She even uses ninja skills. Will you still fight?</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong> Star...</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong> Yes. I will.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong> X, please be my opponent!</p><p><strong>X:</strong> I like that attitude! I&#39;m not going to complain about my stomach being empty, but I wholeheartedly accept any newbies with spirit!</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Ex, this is payback for that red bean bun! Bring it on!</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong> I want to eat more sweet things!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (...Hm? Where am I?)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (This...isn&#39;t Chaldea.)</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (I...I&#39;m in this Voloid body again!?)</p><hr><p><strong>X:</strong> Ah...darn!</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Unayaaaaaabarubarubarumo!</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Special intense lectures by Nameless Red are so boring, I can&#39;t stand it!</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Doubling my tuition would&#39;ve been a hundred times better\u2014Ouch!</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Arrrgh, there&#39;s a dent on my shin now! Hmph!</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Why is there a weird black bucket in my room?</p><p><strong>X:</strong> What are you, a Voloid? Are you an invention of Professor Babbagen? You are!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (No! Ouch!)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (X, it&#39;s me!)</p><hr><p><strong>X:</strong> ...Hmmm, I feel something in the Altrium. A presence I haven&#39;t felt since...</p><p><strong>X:</strong> ...Sorry. It doesn&#39;t look like you&#39;re a defective Voloid, but electricity doesn&#39;t come free.</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Um, when do the waste collectors collect trash Voloids?</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong> Bullying...is bad. Sometimes...it gets confused.</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Hm...Ex. You still need something?</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong> That thing is with me. It&#39;s my only possession.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong> We&#39;re going to be roommates starting today. Please be kind to me, X.</p><p><strong>X:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Huh!? Nobody told me this! A roommate!?</p><p><strong>X:</strong> I had...a single room all to myself, something that can&#39;t normally be enjoyed on backwater planets! My sweet, private school life...!</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong> These were the orders from the student support division, so there&#39;s no mistake. Besides, this room is obviously big enough for two students.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong> Everything on this side of the line is my territory. This space will be our common area.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong> Also I&#39;m going to pull this juice bottle out of our fridge. My snacks won&#39;t fit with that inside.</p><p><strong>X:</strong> You&#39;re rolling the bottle of super extreme explosive carbonated drink, Space Sipep! Th-that&#39;ll cause an explosion!</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Now that I look closely, you look a lot like me! No wonder I did so poorly in that mock battle!</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Even though I held back! You really went all-out on me, and it hurt!</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong> That... Likewise. Thank you.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong> There will be the two of us here from now on, so I ask you to be quieter, please.</p><p><strong>X:</strong> What the... Are you taking over the room already!? Instead of waiting for you to sleep, maybe I&#39;ll slice you up right now!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (Um, no fighting, please.)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (She already has her sword out!)</p><hr><p><strong>Ex:</strong> Careful. Black Knight, stand back. You might get caught in X&#39;s weak beam crossfires.</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Are you calling my sword moves \u201Cweak beams\u201D? Tsk. I didn&#39;t realize you were a Servant of sick burns. Are you perhaps a literary genius?</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Hmph, as a science buff, I don&#39;t think you and I could get along. I suggest you move to another room\u2014</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (X is more versed in physical sports.)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (Haha, science buff... Good one.)</p><hr><p><strong>X:</strong> Here&#39;s a lesson for you! Physical punishment! I saw it in your eyes!</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Why you! Why are you protecting that Voloid!?</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong> Because Black Knight is correct. And your reaction. You just said it yourself!</p><p><strong>X:</strong> You may be a nerd, but your swordsmanship is spot-on. I actually sense that you have some formal training in your background.</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Heh... Heh, heh. Interesting!</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Whether you be an Assassin or Berserker, if you&#39;re a Saberface, then you&#39;re definitely a Saber!</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Okay then, I&#39;m going to get serious now! I don&#39;t have anything against you, but I will cut down all Sabers!</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong> No\u2014 That&#39;s right, I&#39;m a Saber! Fine! That&#39;s how it will be!</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong> By thinking that, I feel like a burden has been lifted...I think.</p><p><strong>X:</strong> I understand that feeling very well! But give up, because your Saber days are over!</p><p><strong>Girls&#39; Dorm Supervisor:</strong></p><p>You two are too noisy!</p><p><strong>Girls&#39; Dorm Supervisor:</strong> Stop your fighting! If you don&#39;t, I&#39;ll put you both in swimsuits, strap you to my Noble Phantasm, and shoot you around the third moon!</p><p><strong>Girls&#39; Dorm Supervisor:</strong> ...Hey, I kicked something.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (Waaahhh, I&#39;m rolling! Stop me! Stop me!)</p><hr><p><strong>X:</strong> Huh?</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Ah. I cut the little guy down on accident! Sorry! I&#39;m really sorry! Are you all right?</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong> Black Knight...</p><p><strong>:</strong> And thus the two fake Sabers began their life together. \u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000Roommates. Roomshare.

How sad and lonesome...</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong> Eradicating Heroine Z was hard work. I still question what that Saber ninja evade move was.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong> And ever since X disappeared, the Saber class students are all sighing with relief.</p><p><strong>God Bless Edison:</strong> Hmm...</p><p><strong>God Bless Edison:</strong> Knowing her, she must be off saving some world in crisis.

And I&#39;m just sitting there, looking bored...</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong> Then then someone special to me secretly gives me candy. It tasted sweet...</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong> But then the hotties disappear from their seats at the round table one by one, like petals dropping from a wilting flower.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong> The quiet round table wasn&#39;t bad.

But.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong> But...there is still something I need to do.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (I have a bad feeling about this...)</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong> You don&#39;t have to be so worried, Black Knight.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong> I secretly collected parts bit by bit, so you&#39;ve powered up quite a bit.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong> If you can help me again...that would be great.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (Ex wears leggings...)</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong> Black Knight...your eye movements are a little creepy.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong> Maybe there&#39;s still some weird programming left. I&#39;m going to change, so go out in the hall.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong> Come on, hurry.</p><hr><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong> Beep boop. So you were the one who called me out here to the dark side of the school.</p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong> Data extraction. Found: a traditional school yard callout to settle old scores. In other words, there&#39;s an one hundred percent possibility that a secret art will be passed on due to graduation.</p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong> ...Good. Preparing to deploy Noble Phantasm for self-defense.</p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong> With my fantasy, my ideal, my dream...the time has come for you to awaken to the appeal of steam!</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong> ...No, that&#39;s not what we&#39;re talking about. I wanted to ask you some personal questions before the battle started, Professor Babbagen.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong> I know you are busy, and you are not around the school much. Tonight was my only chance.</p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong> ...Hm. Steam pressure...dropping. What kind of lecture do you desire, Servant candidate?</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong> Please tell me...</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong> On the planet Lothian, I believe you once battled against a dark lord.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong> That information is strictly confidential, and it is not even in the school&#39;s database. Could you tell me the details...</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong> And tell me what fate befell the black lord!?</p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong> Confidential data, number SA80T521X. Punitive expedition of the planet Lothian.</p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong> Such information is strictly confidential. Of course, revealing such information to a common student candidate is not permissible.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong> All right, then! I have no choice but to tear our your memory media and read it myself!</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong> And...above all...</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong> My heart...is burning and screaming at me that I need to defeat you!</p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong> Hm. I am a gentleman, and a scholar who abhors physical violence.</p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong> Yet I am also aware that I must defend myself against any attack. Student or not, I will not hold back.</p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong> Your burning heart... Show me if it can best my steam power armor!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong> ...Left and right manipulators...stopped. I have sustained critical damage.</p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong> ...Candidate Ex.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong> Yes, Professor Babbagen.</p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong> You were a good student. A truly good student. You were one of the few who sincerely listened to my lectures.</p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong> You sat in front of the class, and I remember you always wiping your fogged up glasses.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong> ...It was tough. It was as tough as eating mochi topped with powdered chestnut without hands...</p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong> ...You have utterly defeated me.</p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong> You so accurately pinpointed my armor&#39;s weaknesses. I can think of no better sign that you studied well.</p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong> I do not have enough information to understand the entire situation, but I can hypothesize about the outcome.</p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong> Ex, you are planning to leave, are you not?</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong> Professor, I...</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong> I just couldn&#39;t like you. I couldn&#39;t help this hatred I felt toward you.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong> But I always liked your lectures. I truly did.</p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong> ...Ah, a student completes her studies and departs. That is every teacher&#39;s joy...</p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong> As your reward, I shall tell you. The dark lord&#39;s name is... \u201CSir Agravain.\u201D</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong> Agra...vain...!</p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong> He was a senior member of the group called the Dark R.O.U.N.D.S.</p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong> As the descendant of a clan that alchemizes artificial Servants, the work he inherited was truly evil.</p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong> The Heroine Zs earlier were just incomplete fakes. What he was searching for was something beyond that... A crystallized form of magecraft.</p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong> But we have been able to determine that he was not successful.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong> Agravain fought valiantly, but he was no match for the overwhelming pressure of my steam.</p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong> In the end, he tumbled down into the castle&#39;s reactor core.</p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong> Whether it was accidental or intentional, I cannot say.</p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong> Not long after, the castle collapsed.</p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong> We conducted a thorough search, but were unable to locate his body.</p><p><strong>Babbagen:</strong> At the same time, the secret ceremonial rites for the creation of artificial Servants were also lost. That&#39;s what I...report...ed.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong> Professor...Professor Babbagen.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong> ...Ungh.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong> Agravain...Agravain...!</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong> My Master... Revenge...!</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong> ...It&#39;s impossible...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Aren&#39;t you going to finish him off? Wouldn&#39;t that be more elegant?</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Encased within his armor, the critical steam will release, cutting off his vision and breathing, and soon after, a world of extreme cold will await him.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> He&#39;s an extremely troublesome enemy.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...iii...</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong> ...Are you the one who is here to get me, as the agent said?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...Indeed, Lord Pendragon.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> The final knight of the fallen Dark R.O.U.N.D.S. ...To think you would be hiding here, right under his nose.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...Hmph. The villain may not always be evil, while the \u201Cgood guy\u201D may not always be working for the weak.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> A school intended to educate heroic Servants? Laughable. You know that the moment it becomes a public facility, it also becomes a pawn of those in power, don&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Never mind. Now we need to think of how to deal with you, Lord Pendragon.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> The reports said you had lost your memories, but by the look of it, you seem to understand what is going on.</p><p><strong>Ex:</strong> Pendragon... Yes, that is the True Name I was given.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> My name is Heroine X Alter. The Ultimate Anti-Anti-Saber Weapon!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Hahahahaha! Wonderful. Let us celebrate your new journey!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I welcome you as a new member of the Villain Alliance. You shall serve me directly!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Admittedly, I am an outsider within the Alliance. But that means you will have absolute freedom in your job! What a wonderful position!</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> ...I see. I&#39;m actually more keen on being told what to do.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> But I do have one wish.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> I would like to take one Voloid with me. AUX Voloid K6-X4.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Hm? What a piece of junk. Fine. Doesn&#39;t look like much, though.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Board my container-shaped infiltration ship. We will return at once to the mothership, and convene with the other alliance members.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> Please, give me ninety seconds to prepare.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Understood. I will await you in the ship.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> ...Black Knight. I have...something to ask you.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> I finally figured out what was wrong with you.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> You have a tiny shard of crystallized Alternium embedded in your head. It was being used to track me.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> That crystal had been receiving mana waves leaking through the cracks of multidimensional space.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> It seems, coincidentally, that you were on the same wavelength as someone else&#39;s mind. They would appear to be a mage.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> But we are headed to a battlefield. Information leaks and unknown elements cannot be permitted.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> I&#39;m going to remove the cause of the problem.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> Maybe you&#39;re still listening to my words through this Black Knight as a vessel.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> If you are...I would like to say goodbye.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> Having someone listen to me when I needed it... I think that was nice.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> When I succeed, and make a name for myself as a Servant...maybe we can talk like this again.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> When that time comes...</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> No, that&#39;s just wishful thinking. She and my deceased Master would both laugh at that thought.</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> See you. Whoever it is, from a Servant Universe far, far away...</p><p><strong>X Alter:</strong> May the Alternium be with you, always...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Whoa! Chaldea!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Did I fall asleep?</p><hr><p><strong>X:</strong> Have you awoken, Master? How was sleeping at the nice warm kotatsu?</p><p><strong>X:</strong> It was good? I&#39;m glad to hear! But Mash seems to be a little disappointed.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>X:</strong> She seems to have kind of made a hobby of watching Master sleep. I don&#39;t understand that allure at all!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ah, ah! Shhhhh. X, I told you to please keep that a secret...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This kotatsu we inherited from Doctor&#39;s room is a Noble Phantasm to be feared!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um... It&#39;s so that Senpai will remain healthy...</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Let&#39;s just keep it that way. This mikan is delicious! This iyokan citrus is sour!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Heroine X... I just saw someone with your face?</p><p><strong>X:</strong> What? Is there something on my face? (Sigh) Fine. Then have a good look at it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> H-hey! Please! Both of you! Your faces are too close!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (This one wears bloomers...)</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Wha...? This is a special spacesuit! It&#39;s a wardrobe essential for those who follow the Star of Altria!</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Well, they were on sale at the school&#39;s store, so I bought them all up.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What are you talking about?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (Sigh) ...Master, were you dreaming? Eh? Not a dream!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Hm...hm... Those are some hazy details.</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Eh? Did I ever have a BFF?</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Oh, come on. I don&#39;t remember anything like that. Sounds like space opera nonsense to me!</p><p><strong>X:</strong> But...yeah. I did have someone I considered a troublesome rival.</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Oh? You want to hear all about it? Uh... Well, it&#39;s not really an interesting story...</p><p><strong>X:</strong> It&#39;s not like I defeated a space dragon, or won first place in a race through the Saint Quartz Run...</p><p><strong>X:</strong> This story isn&#39;t as flashy as all that. It&#39;s just a story about ordinary school life.</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Sheesh. I wonder how she&#39;s doing... That Saber who was energized by Japanese sweets...</p><p><strong>X:</strong> No, no. Forget about that. Let&#39;s talk about releasing the long-awaited EPII!</p><p><strong>X:</strong> I got excited thinking this quest was going to be about that, so I&#39;ve been waiting patiently next to Master this whole time!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I-is that so? Anyway, it looks like you are still going to be talking.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We have run out of both mikan and tea, so I shall go get some more.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Thanks, Mash. What would you like, X?</p><hr><p><strong>X:</strong> Any Japanese sweets. We are sitting at a kotatsu, after all.</p><p><strong>X:</strong> Sometimes the flavor of corruption isn&#39;t so bad!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, understood. I shall go check the kitchen!</p>',467),a=[r];function g(i,p){return o(),e("div",null,a)}var l=t(s,[["render",g],["__file","MHX.html.vue"]]);export{l as default};
