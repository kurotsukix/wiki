We&#39;re on, like, a big crowded street.</p><hr><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> We&#39;re at the foot of the Ryougoku Bridge in Tokyo...no, Edo.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> The shore over there is Musashi Province, where Edo Castle stands. This side is Shimousa.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> That&#39;s why it&#39;s called \u201CRyougoku\u201D Bridge, meaning \u201CTwo Provinces.\u201D It connects the two. Even I know that.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Apparently it&#39;s, like, January 1 today... So I thought it&#39;d be all calm and peaceful, y&#39;know?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> But OMG! It was among the busiest places in the world at the time...a literal million people living there! Known as the city of eight-hundred-and-eight towns!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> There are playhouses, sit-down teahouses, food carts and peddlers, and even freak shows! So Master and I don&#39;t stick out. Sick, huh?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> But aren&#39;t we totally in the Edo period? I can&#39;t even. Master, did you like, just time travel?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> The Edo period!?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Did you think you were dreaming?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> This isn&#39;t my first dream of the year!?</p><hr><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Hmmm? A first dream? Maybe? I guess that&#39;s possible...</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> But no matter how you look at it, you can&#39;t change what&#39;s happening IRL. Think about what you&#39;re gonna do, not what has already happened.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> So, tell me...how much do you remember before you lost consciousness, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Um, let&#39;s see...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> If I think back...</p><hr><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> ...Uh-huh.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> So there was a NYE party at Chaldea? Oh yeah, there was. LIT.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> And you ate New Year&#39;s udon with Musashi? And you got New Year&#39;s mochi and pickles from Hijikata?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> And you ate sweet red bean soup with Chacha? And you gave a New Year&#39;s gift to Baraki and ate sweets?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Oh, come on! You ate your way through New Year&#39;s! Rather than doing traditional stuff like visiting a shrine, you&#39;re just in it for the fun?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> ...Hm? You, Okki, and Archerferno played board games together?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> What!? Well, thanks for the invite! No fair! Bah...and what else?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Nobbu crashed your game and forced you to drink some super sketch drink from a foreign country...?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> That&#39;s it! Bingo!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> I drank that too! Maybe that&#39;s why I&#39;m here with you!?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> A golden, honey flavored drink!!! I say that&#39;s the cause of this whole mess!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> My senses are totally telling me that! It may have been honey flavored, but it was TOO sparkly!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I was told it would bring good luck for the New Year, so I had a sip...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I don&#39;t remember anything after I took a drink...</p><hr><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> OMG... I also let my guard down from all the hype...</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> So let&#39;s rewind. Our current galaxy brain for this place is...</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> A Reality Marble, virtual reality on a Spiritron level, a parallel world that went off the rails from the timeline...or, to go totally cray cray...a collab dream?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Do you really think this is reality?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> I&#39;m getting that you really want this to be your first dream of the year or something. Guess I can let you have that much. Not like I&#39;ve got another explanation.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I had a \u201Cdream\u201D like this last New Year&#39;s.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Are you talking about Musashi?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> I heard the deets, and I think it was more like you were in a different world that made you THINK it was a dream. But whatevs.</p><hr><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Anyway, let&#39;s assume that we&#39;re in some kind of dream.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Servants don&#39;t usually dream, so I&#39;m, like, ninety percent sure that this is totes all you...</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Hmmm, in which case, that&#39;s lit AF! I mean, it&#39;s so realistic and stuff! You keeping your genius on the DL?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Even though I only know the basics of the Edo period, I knew right off that we were totally in Edo!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Actually, it feels more realistic than the real thing. Like some god is lurking in the shadows or something!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> And if this is all a dream, there&#39;s nothing to worry about, and by the time that shady drink wears off, we&#39;ll be back in Chaldea, right?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> So if that&#39;s the case, I wouldn&#39;t mind hooking up for a mini-New Year&#39;s date with you, Master. Teehee.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> A date&#39;s not such a bad idea.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Right!? Nothing beats going out!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Do you really think we can get back to Chaldea?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> We&#39;ll be fine! After all, you got me here with you, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> ...Whoa! Watch out, Master! No getting stomped on my watch!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1ATownsperson:</strong> Okay, outta my way!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1ATownsperson:</strong> Only crazy people would be stupid enough to be standing in the middle of this traffic!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> What!? YOU&#39;RE the one who&#39;s insane for bolting over the bridge so fast! SUPER dangerous, guy.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> And where&#39;s the fire? Shouldn&#39;t you be taking it easy &#39;cuz it&#39;s New Year&#39;s!?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1ATownsperson:</strong> I&#39;m in a hurry BECAUSE it&#39;s New Year&#39;s. It&#39;s almost time for the kakizome, the first calligraphy writing of the year, at the Ekou-in!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1ATownsperson:</strong> THE Katsushika Hokusai is gonna be doing the honors...and I get to watch it with my own eyes!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Katsushika...Hokusai!? I swear I&#39;ve heard that name before...</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Do you know the name, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Katsushika Hokusai...totes famous.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> For real!? Then we should go check it out too!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Edo&#39;s most famous ukiyo-e painter.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Ooh, a celebrity! Did you secretly wanna go to art school or something? Not many people wanna dream about someone like that, you know?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> So I think the whatsit temple that guy mentioned is near by. Wanna go check it out?</p><hr><p><strong>:</strong></p><p>\u3010Main Street Ryougoku, Ekou-in Grounds\u3011</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> A young girl with a giant brush...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> She&#39;s writing something on the ground...</p><hr><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Wow, what&#39;s going on?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Okay, that brush is STUPIDLY big! And that paper she&#39;s writing on could cover the whole temple!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> That young girl is the painter? Is SHE Hokusai!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Weird...I thought Hokusai was a man...</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Uh, considering the people you got on speed dial, that means literally nothing, you know...</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Still, the townspeople seem a little confused too. Maybe it isn&#39;t actually Hokusai after all?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Same deal as with Musashi, then?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Hey Master! I thought we came to see a painting!?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> If your mood right now is a high school girl who looks killer in a kimono, then, uh, I&#39;m right here.</p><hr><p><strong>Townspeople A:</strong> Wow. I hear the calligraphy paper&#39;s the size of one hundred and twenty tatami mats.</p><p><strong>Townspeople A:</strong> The disciples are all hovering around her, ready to blow water over the paper and wipe away ink...</p><p><strong>Townspeople A:</strong> Still, that&#39;s not Master Hokusai, right? Who the heck is she?</p><p><strong>Townspeople B:</strong> What, you don&#39;t know? That&#39;s Hokusai&#39;s daughter.</p><p><strong>Townspeople B:</strong> I hear she&#39;s quite the artist herself. Can&#39;t remember her pseudonym, though...</p><p><strong>Townspeople A:</strong> Heh. Don&#39;t act like a know-it-all. You don&#39;t know any more than I do.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s not...the real Katsushika Hokusai?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It&#39;s his daughter...?</p><hr><p><strong>A\uFF1AHokusai&#39;s Daughter:</strong> Ooooh-kay! Done and done!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AHokusai&#39;s Daughter:</strong> Hang the paper up! Higher! Higher! Up like a kite!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Hm? Oh, we can finally get the whole pic and see what&#39;s she painting this whole time!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Ah... It&#39;s Hotei-son! A manifestation of the Maitreya Buddha!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Huh. Not bad.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> A picture of Hotei? Oh, I see it now...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I couldn&#39;t tell while she was painting it.</p><hr><p><strong>A\uFF1AHokusai&#39;s Daughter:</strong> Everyone, take a nice, long gander! A picture of Hotei-son, the great monk Q\xEC C\u01D0 from Karakuni.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AHokusai&#39;s Daughter:</strong> I had the honor of offering my drawing to the gods using the first water, the first ink, and first brush of the year on this auspicious New Year&#39;s Day!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AHokusai&#39;s Daughter:</strong> As you should all know, I&#39;ve drawn one of the Seven Lucky Gods! Just one peek at it will grant you good luck in the coming year!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AHokusai&#39;s Daughter:</strong> With this incredible start-of-the-year painting that requires one to step back ten paces just to see...</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AHokusai&#39;s Daughter:</strong> ...I hereby offer a small New Year&#39;s greeting from the Katsushika Hokusai school of art.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1APublisher:</strong> Everyone who&#39;s come to see this spectacle...take a look at these goods, too!</p><p><strong>F\uFF1APublisher:</strong> Fresh off from the printing press! Master Hokusai&#39;s latest ukiyo-e!</p><p><strong>F\uFF1APublisher:</strong> And for the kiddos, a painted board game where they can take a tour around Enoshima!</p><p><strong>F\uFF1APublisher:</strong> We even have Treasure Ship ukiyo-e that you put under your pillow! A necessity for your New Year&#39;s dream!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (Maybe this really is my New Year&#39;s dream...)</p><hr><p><strong>A\uFF1AHokusai&#39;s Daughter:</strong> Whew...all done for now...</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AHokusai&#39;s Daughter:</strong> ...Oh? Oh? Oh, oh, oh?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> She&#39;s totally staring.

You&#39;re quite the beauty!</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AHokusai&#39;s Daughter:</strong> Are you an actor? Or are you one of those traveling courtesans?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AHokusai&#39;s Daughter:</strong> You don&#39;t see a beauty like this every day...even among Yoshiwara&#39;s hostesses! A great omen! A sight for sore eyes...right at the beginning of the New Year!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> ...!? Huh!?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Th-that...isn&#39;t...completely fake news...</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> ...Hm? A hostess? Traveling courtesan? Aren&#39;t those...</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AHokusai&#39;s Daughter:</strong> Ahh...if I wasn&#39;t so swamped, I&#39;d totally ask you to model for me.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AHokusai&#39;s Daughter:</strong> By the way...</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AHokusai&#39;s Daughter:</strong> That [\u2642 sodden-looking boy /\u2640 stylish-looking girl] next to you is in a weird-looking getup. Is that some sort of European outfit?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AHokusai&#39;s Daughter:</strong> Or is [\u2642 he /\u2640 she] just pretending to be [\u2642 an old sage /\u2640 a pretty fairy] or something? Year&#39;s just started! Kinda early for that sort of weirdness, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AHokusai&#39;s Daughter:</strong> Oh, pardon me. Don&#39;t take my words too personally. Just a bit of festive teasing.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AHokusai&#39;s Daughter:</strong> There&#39;s always a buncha weird guys walkin&#39; around here, it being the freak show neighborhood and all.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Are you Katsushika Hokusai, the ukiyo-e painter?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AHokusai&#39;s Daughter:</strong> Ahaha! Nope, nope. I&#39;m just a measly assistant.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AHokusai&#39;s Daughter:</strong> Katsushika Hokusai is my Toto-sama. Ya know, my father.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (What&#39;s that creature floating next to her...?)</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AHokusai&#39;s Daughter:</strong> What&#39;s wrong? What you starin&#39; at?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AHokusai&#39;s Daughter:</strong> You lookin&#39; for Hokusai? Sorry, but he&#39;s not here.</p><hr><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> If you&#39;re not the legit Hokusai, why were you the one painting with the big brush?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AHokusai&#39;s Daughter:</strong> ...Hmmm...well...it&#39;s a long story.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Oh?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> My name is Suzuka.

I&#39;ve got nothing to be ashamed of!</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> If you still insist on arresting people, you&#39;ll have to start with me!</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> ...But know I got this giant brush, and like any ukiyo-e painter worth their salt, I&#39;m not afraid to use it!</p><p><strong>Detective \u201CHatchoubori\u201D:</strong> ...Hm. I have no issue being a fool and a lazy bum...</p><p><strong>Detective \u201CHatchoubori\u201D:</strong> But if you say it out loud like that in public, you&#39;re making our jobs difficult.</p><p><strong>Detective \u201CHatchoubori\u201D:</strong> Ah, and the way you&#39;re mocking us! I can&#39;t just let that slide!</p><p><strong>Officer \u201CBou\u201D:</strong> You&#39;re going to die...and all for our secret money stash! Don&#39;t underestimate the accounting department of the magistrate&#39;s office!</p><p><strong>Officer \u201CSei\u201D:</strong> You&#39;re under arrest\u266A</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Oei! We&#39;re going to lend you a hand! Master and I are TOTES ready after all that hype!</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Oh? That sword of yours isn&#39;t a theater prop? It&#39;s real!?</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> What a surprise. A female samurai... You&#39;re straight out of a novel! I like you even more now!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Whew...what a surprise...but I don&#39;t know what happened here...</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> I charged in without thinking, but what the heck happened? My body feels really light.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> I can run as fast as a bolt of lightning and swing my brush like a tornado.</p><p><strong>Detective \u201CHatchoubori\u201D:</strong> Okay, that was impressive.</p><p><strong>Detective \u201CHatchoubori\u201D:</strong> You wield a brush so wonderfully. It is a shame that you remain but a painter.</p><p><strong>Detective \u201CHatchoubori\u201D:</strong> Hm... Whether you are the real Hokusai or not, you certainly have the skills of a true artist.</p><p><strong>Detective \u201CHatchoubori\u201D:</strong> We were at fault here, I admit it. We framed you for a crime you didn&#39;t commit, and I apologize for that.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> O-okay... It&#39;s fine, as long as you understand.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> I got a little carried away, too. A-are you hurt?</p><p><strong>Officer \u201CBou\u201D:</strong> Heh. When did you get so soft, Hatchoubori?</p><p><strong>Officer \u201CBou\u201D:</strong> Whatever their reasons, they interfered with the duties of agents of the shogunate! They are definitely not getting off the hook here!</p><p><strong>Detective \u201CHatchoubori\u201D:</strong> That&#39;s not true. Take a good look...we are within the grounds of the Ekou-in.</p><p><strong>Detective \u201CHatchoubori\u201D:</strong> And that means that this was all merely a round of sumo held in offering to the gods, though I&#39;ll grant you it was a lively round.</p><p><strong>Officer \u201CBou\u201D:</strong> Sumo...? You really are a softie. Well, if you want to call this a minor offense, so be it.</p><p><strong>Detective \u201CHatchoubori\u201D:</strong> We shall take our leave. My apologies, Nishimuraya.</p><p><strong>Publisher \u201CNishimuraya\u201D:</strong> Please think nothing of it!</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Oh? A dream? This whole city?</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Ahaha! That&#39;s so ridiculous, Fujimaru!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m actually serious...</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Literally!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Do you have anything to say, Suzuka?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Well, you know...you SAY it&#39;s a dream, but battle totes hurts. And...if I do this...it tickles, doesn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Well, if you think about it, this is probably more than your everyday dream, Master. It&#39;s probably, like, some kinda vision or something.</p><hr><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Haha! No, sorry for laughing. To tell you the truth...</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> I&#39;ve always loved wild stories like that, even if people look at me like I&#39;m crazy when I say so.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> So thinking that this world is actually someone&#39;s dream...why not?</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Take \u201CThe Butterfly Dream\u201D or \u201CThe World Inside a Pillow,\u201D for example. Both stories from Karakuni.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;re the one in our dream, or if we&#39;re the ones in your dream...</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> ...But that&#39;s probably not really important right now.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Are we dancing...or are we being made to dance...? OMG, Oei, you&#39;re sooo funny!</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Hehe! Sorry to drag you into all this trouble.</p><p><strong>Publisher \u201CNishimuraya\u201D:</strong> I would also like to thank you.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Nishimuraya, I won&#39;t let you get forced out of business like Tsutajuu.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> But...where in the world has my Toto-sama gone wanderin&#39; off to?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Is there a problem?</p><hr><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Come on, why don&#39;t you tell Master?</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> ...Yeah... Maybe I can confide in you.</p><p><strong>Publisher \u201CNishimuraya\u201D:</strong> So actually...and please keep this confidential...</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> ...Missing? Since yesterday? So you have no clue where this Katsushika Hokusai guy is?</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> ...Yeah, I&#39;ve got nothin&#39;.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> I&#39;ve been searchin&#39; for him with help from the other disciples, but he&#39;s not at the bars in back of Asakusa Shrine or in Yoshiwara, and we didn&#39;t find him on the pleasure boats either.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Toto-sama is real flighty, but he&#39;s never just up and left without telling anyone.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> If he tripped and fell into the Sumida River, it&#39;ll be a few more days before he floats up.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Oh great, now I&#39;ve got an image of a drowned body stuck in my head! Don&#39;t say that kinda stuff! Bad luck and such!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Speaking of floating...what is that creature next to you...?</p><hr><p><strong>Oei:</strong> This? Well...this is...</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> It&#39;s...an octopus, duh.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> It ain&#39;t unusual for things to be floatin&#39; during New Year&#39;s. I guess it&#39;d usually be a kite though, yeah...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Y-you think so...?</p><hr><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> It&#39;s getting all hyped up too. Totally ugly-cute. Let me squeeze it!</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Oh, wait! Don&#39;t touch it!</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Eek!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> It spit ink!?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Totally my bad. S-sorry! Let me wipe it off!</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Ungh...don&#39;t worry about it... My face is dirty from ink already anyway. Haha...</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> This octopus is a little crabby (wipe wipe), and I&#39;ve just been ignoring it because there&#39;s nothing I could do to control it (wipe wipe wipe).</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AOei:</strong> Phew. So...about Toto-sama...</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AOei:</strong> I know I managed to make it through the Hotei-son gig at the Ekou-in...</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AOei:</strong> ...but actually, the original plan was to follow up by doing a miniature painting of sparrows on a grain of rice.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AOei:</strong> Sadly, the best I can manage is maybe one bird to a grain. Toto-sama would have been able to get two or three birds on a single grain.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> One grain of rice...? That&#39;s a pretty crazy standard you&#39;re setting.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AOei:</strong> And there&#39;s also one more incredibly important job left.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1AOei:</strong> We definitely need Toto-sama for this one.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> An important job...?</p><hr><p><strong>:</strong></p><p>\u3010Somewhere in Edo - Ukiyo-e Painter&#39;s Atelier\u3011</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong> It appears that the cops we sent to Ekou-in have failed.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong> Perhaps you should have been a bit more generous with your payoff?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> I don&#39;t care if a clown who thinks she&#39;s a painter wants to make a fool of herself.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> But since Hokusai himself didn&#39;t show his face even after all that, his disciples must not know where he is, either.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> Where the hell did he go?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> Either way, if Hokusai&#39;s not around...he won&#39;t be able to appear before the court tomorrow.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong> The painting performance before the court... Before the shogun, Lord Tokugawa Ienari.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong> Do you really think so, Grand Mentor? They may still send a substitute.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong> After all, he&#39;s a man who had a chicken draw a painting in his place.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> The nerve of him. What does he think art is? Exactly the sort of nonsense I&#39;d expect from that clown.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> A substitute, you say... There&#39;s no harm in being cautious. Do you know who was used?</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong> Out of the hundred disciples in Hokusai&#39;s school...</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong> The one most likely to be chosen as a substitute is his daughter, Katsushika Oui.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong> If we&#39;re to tarnish his reputation for good, we need to be absolutely sure.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> Indeed. Let&#39;s communicate with \u201CHoeidou\u201D and plan our next steps.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> We&#39;re going to run that imposter clown out of Edo, once and for all. You. You&#39;re going to be a part of it, too.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> Understood, Hiroshige?</p><p><strong>Utagawa Hiroshige:</strong> Yes, Grand Mentor. I, Utagawa Hiroshige, will see this through.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> ...By the way. Are you sure this was the right casting choice?</p><p><strong>Utagawa Hiroshige:</strong> Haha. Probably. There still aren&#39;t many artist Servants, so there is nothing for it, really.</p><p><strong>Utagawa Hiroshige:</strong> I think it&#39;s fine. Dream or no dream, I&#39;m having fun.</p><p><strong>Utagawa Hiroshige:</strong> A human&#39;s life dazzles the brightest when one dreams.</p><h2 id="ukiyo-e-is-dreamlike" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ukiyo-e-is-dreamlike" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Ukiyo-e is Dreamlike</h2><p><strong>:</strong></p><p>\u3010Ryougoku - Katsushika Hokusai&#39;s New Home\u3011</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Make yourself at home.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> I&#39;ve left the other disciples with Nishimuraya to handle the ukiyo-e sales at the Enkou-in.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> So I&#39;m going to take a rest.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Presenting your painting in front of the shogun? So you&#39;re going to paint in front of him?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> The shogun ruling Edo, huh? So, like, the Seii-Taishogun! Is he hot!?</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Are you talking about Lord Ienari? Not one bit. There&#39;s no such thing as a good-looking shogun.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Hey, sure there is! Don&#39;t say that!</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Ahaha, sorry &#39;bout that. I was just kidding. Don&#39;t get so mad.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> But it doesn&#39;t matter as long as he has work. He&#39;s as important a customer to me as the townsfolk are.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Toto-sama has never cared much about money, but lately he&#39;s completely indifferent.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> So money&#39;s always tight...</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> By the way, what were you going to paint for of the shogun?</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> It&#39;s supposed to be an auspicious painting fit for New Year&#39;s. We were tasked to paint a Treasure Ship for him.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Toto-sama may not be here, but we have no choice. I&#39;ll at least prepare the tools and references.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> This is so messy...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> \u201CMake yourself at home,\u201D she says, but there&#39;s no room...</p><hr><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> OMG. All those paintings of beautiful women, so gorgeous... But they were drawn in such a gross room!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> There&#39;s a half-eaten bowl of rice just SITTING THERE on the floor! Yuck! Clean up a little!</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> What!? Cleaning!?</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> We haven&#39;t cleaned this place since we moved in!</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> And I&#39;ve never cooked in my life, if I may add.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What!? Hm...? O-ouch!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I stepped on something... Oh, it&#39;s a little wooden sculpture.</p><hr><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Ah, that&#39;s a Kukai statue. It&#39;s the blessed, great Koubou-Daishi.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Oh, so THAT&#39;S where that was hiding. It&#39;s no painting tool, but thanks for finding it.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Toto-sama prays to it every morning and night. It represents the Myouken Bosatsu.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Maybe that&#39;s why Toto-sama was in a bad mood...</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> ...Hm? Wait a minute.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> I don&#39;t believe this! There&#39;s one place I haven&#39;t looked yet!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Oei, where&#39;re you going?</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> You guys just sit there and eat some of that bean paste mochi! I got it as a present!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Bean paste mochi? Or...uh, is that matcha\u2013eek! OH GROSS! It&#39;s just MOLDY!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Where are you going?</p><hr><p><strong>Oei:</strong> To Yanagishima&#39;s Mt. Myouken! The Hosshou Temple by the Jikken Bridge!</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Toto-sama went up there to pray a lot in his youth. He was really struggling back then, and near to giving up.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s true or not, but Toto-sama said he narrowly escaped death when a lightning bolt struck right next to him.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> And since that happened, the work has been pouring in.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I see... I&#39;ll help you look for him.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Jikken Bridge is where you can get the best photos of Tokyo Skytree.</p><hr><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> Oh, there she is. Hold on a sec.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> You... Are you by chance Katsushika Oui, the ukiyo-e painter?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> ...(Gulp)</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> (An octopus...)</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Eh? Oh, yeah, that&#39;s right. Why do you know my name?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> Old Meowster! We found her!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> Come on, Old Meowster! This is no time to get seconds on dumplings!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Old Meowster...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What kind of Mito Jaguar-mon is this?</p><hr><p><strong>Old Meowster:</strong> Hm! Good work, Miss Suke and Miss Kaku!</p><p><strong>Old Meowster:</strong> Sic &#39;em!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> That&#39;s too fast! Don&#39;t jump the gun!</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> You guys...are dressed real strange. My eyes sting. Are you candy craftsmen or something?</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Maybe it isn&#39;t my business, but... It&#39;d be one thing if you were in one of Ryougoku&#39;s freak shows...</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Wandering around the streets of Edo in getups like that, you&#39;ll be arrested for public indecency. You won&#39;t be able to sell ever gain.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Hmmm... I&#39;m a little worried... Maybe I should just paint over your outfits?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> I&#39;m terribly sorry! This is just our norm! And please don&#39;t paint over us...</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> Miss Suke can&#39;t help it. Her name stands for \u201CSuper Ultra Kinky Enchantress,\u201D after all.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> Slander!!!</p><p><strong>Miss Kakuloe:</strong> I&#39;m Kakuloe. That&#39;s Ilysuke.</p><p><strong>Miss Kakuloe:</strong> We&#39;re taking a leisurely trip through the country with Miss High-and-Mighty here.</p><p><strong>Miss Kakuloe:</strong> She&#39;s a retired chirimen merchant from Echigo.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Oh, I see. So what do you want?</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> I&#39;m in a hurry. Can we take a rain check?</p><p><strong>Miss Illysuke:</strong> U-um! Have you ever seen this ukiyo-e?</p><p><strong>Miss Kakuloe:</strong> Some suspicious-looking art dealer sold this to us. He tricked us into thinking it was a bona fide Hokusai piece.</p><p><strong>Old Meowster:</strong> Ab-purr-lutely!</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> ...So that&#39;s why you need me. I guess I have no choice.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> ...Give it to me. I&#39;ll take a look.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s a scroll of a beautiful woman...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Whether it&#39;s a fake or not, there&#39;s something off about all this.</p><hr><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Thicc and sexy bare legs are a no-no? The Edo period sure is the worst.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Do you think I should change my style? Hmmm?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Wait...is this not...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...Are Suzuka and I not the ones dreaming here?</p><hr><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Master! Don&#39;t ghost me! Hey, I&#39;m gonna strip right here!</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> ...Yeah. This ukiyo-e is definitely real.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> I know this printer&#39;s work, and the brush strokes of the signature are familiar.</p><p><strong>Old Meowster:</strong> I mew it!</p><p><strong>Old Meowster:</strong> Nyafufu! My appraisal was correct!</p><p><strong>H\uFF1AOld Meowster:</strong> Now behold this hollyhock crested toe bean!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AMiss Illysuke:</strong> Too early...still too early, Old Meowster...</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AMiss Illysuke:</strong> ...Um, would you please stop silently pressing your toe beans all over my face?</p><p><strong>H\uFF1AOld Meowster:</strong> BEHOLD IT!!!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AMiss Illysuke:</strong> Ugh, I asked you to stop!

Miss Old Meowster!?</p><p><strong>Miss Kakuloe:</strong> Old Meowster&#39;s feral instincts are going berserk again...</p><p><strong>Miss Kakuloe:</strong> Well, I&#39;m going to let Ilysuke handle that thing... Now then, Katsushika Oui...</p><p><strong>Miss Kakuloe:</strong> ...our Old Meowster is insinuating that this ukiyo-e was actually drawn by you.</p><p><strong>Miss Kakuloe:</strong> It may be hard to believe, but she&#39;s actually got quite a good eye.</p><p><strong>Miss Kakuloe:</strong> That&#39;s why she bought it\u2013because she took a liking to it.</p><p><strong>Miss Kakuloe:</strong> But she couldn&#39;t believe that the signature said \u201CHokusai.\u201D</p><p><strong>Miss Kakuloe:</strong> To be just like a certain someone...and yet, not acknowledged as a different person from that someone...</p><p><strong>Miss Kakuloe:</strong> She says the painting reflects outrage at that contradiction.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> I don&#39;t care...</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> And what do you care?</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> You don&#39;t know a thing about ukiyo-e.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> The customers all are happy they&#39;re buying Katsushika Hokusai paintings. Nobody&#39;s getting hurt.</p><p><strong>Miss Kakuloe:</strong> You don&#39;t think so?</p><p><strong>Miss Kakuloe:</strong> I don&#39;t know a thing about ukiyo-e...</p><p><strong>Miss Kakuloe:</strong> ...but I can sniff out lies a mile away. Especially lies that people tell to themselves.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> ...Ungh.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> ...Oei? Hey, Oei. What&#39;s going on? You triggered?</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> What&#39;s it matter if it&#39;s plain, or a lie?</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> No matter what people say, this is my way of living!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> A p-purge!? That&#39;s...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> A strong magical energy response! Oei&#39;s a Servant!? <strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Master, you feel it too!? Does that mean Oei&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> This dream realm is...hers...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> S-she stripped! Nice tracts of la</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> THAT&#39;S what you&#39;re focusing on!?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> You know what, I curse you! I hope you get a New Year&#39;s dumpling stuck in your throat and sent to THAT nurse&#39;s armory\u2013I mean, infirmary!</p><hr><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> If Oei&#39;s an unknown Servant...</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> ...I can&#39;t just sit by and tell myself this is a dream.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1ASuzuka Gozen:</strong> I&#39;m going to up my INT too! Okay, Master!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m counting on you, Suzuka!</p><p><strong>G\uFF1ASuzuka Gozen:</strong> Got it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That style is pretty lit too, Suzuka!</p><p><strong>G\uFF1ASuzuka Gozen:</strong> U-uh, Master... Okay! Now you&#39;re speaking my language!</p><hr><p><strong>G\uFF1ASuzuka Gozen:</strong> Oei, I&#39;m going to back you up for now, but you&#39;ll have a lot of explaining to do later!</p><p><strong>F\uFF1AOei:</strong> ...Suzuka.</p><p><strong>F\uFF1AOei:</strong> You&#39;re such a busybody. The only person who can boss me around is Toto-sama!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMiss Kakuloe:</strong> ...Oh. Sorry. Did I hit a nerve?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AMiss Illysuke:</strong> Please don&#39;t deliberately antagonize people! Though I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the only reason why she&#39;s mad...</p><p><strong>H\uFF1AOld Meowster:</strong> Heh. Miss Suke. Miss Kaku.</p><p><strong>H\uFF1AOld Meowster:</strong> It&#39;s time for the Black Panther of Edo\u2013I mean, the Mito Kou-meow Jaguar to show her true stripes!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMiss Kakuloe:</strong> Yes!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AMiss Illysuke:</strong> Understood!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMiss Kakuloe:</strong> Do you not see these toe beans!?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMiss Kakuloe:</strong> Who do you think this person in front of you is?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AMiss Illysuke:</strong> Tremble before the former vice shogun... Um...the vice shogun from about...two hundred years ago!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AMiss Illysuke:</strong> It is Lord Mito Mitsukuni!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AMiss Illysuke:</strong> You stand before a great elder lord!

It felt like...I turned into Toto-sama, or something...</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Simmer down! Oh, and I need to straighten your clothes...</p><p><strong>Miss Illysuke:</strong> U-um, if I&#39;m not overstepping my boundaries, I would like to help!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> OMG, thanks!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Are you okay, Oei?</p><hr><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Yeah. I am now.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> That beautiful piece...was a collaboration between me and Toto-sama.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> I believe it was the first time I was tasked with rendering the main subject.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> I painted the woman, and Toto-sama painted the background flowers, like the crape myrtle.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Since then, I&#39;ve painted many works under Toto-sama&#39;s name...</p><p><strong>Old Meowster:</strong> I see. So that&#39;s the reason for the disjointed feeling.</p><p><strong>Miss Illysuke:</strong> D-does that mean...some sections of the paintings are fa\u2013I mean, counterfeit...?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> ...That&#39;s not the right way to think of it. Ukiyo-e paintings are mostly made as collabs by multiple people in the first place.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> First, you have the painter who designs and renders the original image. Then there&#39;s the carver who cuts the wooden blocks faithfully to the original design.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Then there&#39;s the printer, who precisely transfers multiple layers of color to paper.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> And then there&#39;s the publisher, who suggests and manages each project, advertises new prints to customers, and handles distribution.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Put them all together, and you&#39;ve got yourself a team! It&#39;s totally different than Western painters!</p><p><strong>Miss Kakuloe:</strong> Oh, really? So the pen name \u201CKatsushika Hokusai\u201D isn&#39;t just a single painter&#39;s name...</p><p><strong>Miss Kakuloe:</strong> ...but something like a brand name, really?</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> ...You sure do know a lot, Suzuka. You sound and look godly, even.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> But...yeah, you&#39;re absolutely right.</p><p><strong>Old Meowster:</strong> I get it now. It&#39;s all purr-fectly clear now.</p><p><strong>Old Meowster:</strong> If that&#39;s the case, I have only one request! Katsushika Oui...will you give me a paw-tograph?</p><p><strong>Old Meowster:</strong> Write it to \u201CAdrian\u201D! Wait, no, \u201CAlien\u201D? No, that&#39;s still not right...</p><p><strong>Old Meowster:</strong> Um...anyway! Would you mind adding your cool-sounding pen name to the painting?</p><p><strong>Old Meowster:</strong> I have at least the right to ask for that!</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> B-but... MY name...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> The customer always gets what they want, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (The octopus has been nodding its head the whole time...)</p><hr><p><strong>Oei:</strong> B-but...</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Why don&#39;t you just write it, Oei?</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Stop... Really... It&#39;s...embarrassing...</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Fine. I&#39;m only doing this because I want to make up for my blunder from earlier.</p><p><strong>Old Meowster:</strong> Okay, Miss Kaku! Ink! Get the ink and brush ready!</p><p><strong>Miss Kakuloe:</strong> Sure, sure.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> By the way, about that suspicious art dealer selling ukiyo-e...?</p><hr><p><strong>Miss Illysuke:</strong> Um, there were two of them...and they never introduced themselves.</p><p><strong>Miss Illysuke:</strong> I did some secret snooping, and I found that they were carrying things labeled \u201CSeieidou\u201D and \u201CKitsurudou.\u201D</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> \u201CSeieidou\u201D and \u201CKitsurudou\u201D?</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> What the...? They&#39;re both publishers that handle works from the Utagawa school.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> But that&#39;s strange. I don&#39;t think we sell our work to either of them...</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> And as for this print here, I remember I personally asked the printer to produce a smaller quantity.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> I got so heated up on this piece, and the picture turned out to be so intricate, the printing blocks broke easily.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> It&#39;s a failed piece. You could say I got a little carried away.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> So when I was shown that piece, I was surprised...and couldn&#39;t control myself.</p><p><strong>Miss Illysuke:</strong> Ah... Maybe that&#39;s why it was so expensive. Five whole ryou...</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Five ryou? That can&#39;t be. That&#39;s ten times\u2013no, a hundred times the market price.</p><p><strong>Old Meowster:</strong> ...MEOWHAT.</p><p><strong>Miss Illysuke:</strong> See, Old Meowster...I told you so. It WAS a shady transaction!</p><p><strong>Miss Illysuke:</strong> And Edo&#39;s already an expensive city as it is!</p><p><strong>Miss Illysuke:</strong> Old Meowster, looks like you&#39;ll be stuck with instant noodl\u2013no, you&#39;ll only be able to afford broth!</p><p><strong>Old Meowster:</strong> Wh-what the... That&#39;s a cat-astrophe! I want super spicy ramen with extra pork belly or something!</p><p><strong>Old Meowster:</strong> M-money...it&#39;s all about the money, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Old Meowster:</strong> M-Miss Suke...Miss Kaku...this entire meeting must have been fate...</p><p><strong>Old Meowster:</strong> Why don&#39;t you two head over to Hokusai&#39;s studio and model for them...?</p><p><strong>Old Meowster:</strong> You know...show a bit of skin...in an ero style...we&#39;ll sign for a generous royalty agreement so we can cash it in...heh heh heh...</p><p><strong>Miss Kakuloe:</strong> That is way outside our agreement as travel companions. Not going to do it. Not interested.</p><p><strong>Miss Kakuloe:</strong> Illysuke seems keen, though. Maybe have her entwine seductively with a giant octopus or something. It&#39;s totally her!</p><p><strong>Miss Illysuke:</strong> What the heck!? I&#39;m not doing that!!! No way!</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Ahaha! Yeah, it&#39;ll be for your own sake to not pursue that.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Unlike the olden days, releasing an enpon or even a single shunga print is tough enough.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Putting something like that out on the black market is one thing, but openly doing business without a registered seal is a recipe for trouble.</p><p><strong>Old Meowster:</strong> Grrr... I don&#39;t have a cat&#39;s chance in hell.</p><p><strong>Old Meowster:</strong> Still, I learned a lot about Edo&#39;s ukiyo-e situation! Thanks, dashing geisha girl!</p><p><strong>Old Meowster:</strong> All right, everyone! Promise Professor Jaguar that if you get a chance you&#39;ll Ryou-GO to the museum in Ryougoku!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> She acted like a teacher at the very end!</p><h2 id="one-stroke-of-springtime-erotic-dream" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#one-stroke-of-springtime-erotic-dream" aria-hidden="true">#</a> One Stroke of Springtime (Erotic) Dream</h2><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> There were a few unbelievable encounters, but let&#39;s just delete them from our feeds.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Oei, while we&#39;re walking, would you mind telling us something? I&#39;m just curious...</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> If we never find your Toto-sama, what happens to you?</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> If we can&#39;t find him? Well, you know...</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Our client here is the shogun; we&#39;re doing this for the top man here in Japan. This is a whole other game from just mouthing off to the police.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> If we offend him, we&#39;ll be getting off easy if all he demands is seppuku.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> At worst, he could have us executed, our assets seized, and our family line ended.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Seppuku!? That, like, kills you!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s what happens when you crossthe highest authority in the land...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Didn&#39;t that the, uh, Old Meowster call herselfa vice shogun or something...?</p><hr><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> I know! Hey, Oei...</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Even if we can&#39;t find Toto-sama, why can&#39;t you go up in front of the lord?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Sick, right? That was, like, the best idea!</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> D-don&#39;t be ridiculous! The invitation was for Toto-sama... The actual Katsushika Hokusai!</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Unlike you, I can&#39;t just do a magic quick change and show up saying I&#39;m Hokusai...</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Eh, what!? I don&#39;t want any stink eye.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> I can&#39;t believe it... Well, I had a suspicion...</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> An eboshi hat, that dance costume ...and your swordsmanship...!</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Suzuka...are you THE Suzuka Gozen!? The beautiful thief of Mt. Suzuka...!?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Hm? I am. I didn&#39;t mention that?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Do you know about Suzuka Gozen, Oei?</p><hr><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Course I do! I&#39;m a painter, after all!</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Legends and lore from all eras and lands are the tools of the trade for painters like us!</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Toto-sama was always so passionate in collecting reference materials like that.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Not only does he have popular picture books, but also tons of scrolls, illustrations, and art from Karakuni.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> When I was a child, I enjoyed reading them at his side.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Then I learned that the reason money&#39;s always tight no matter how many paintings get sold...</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> ...is the vast amount Toto-sama spends on all those reference materials and the cost of paint. Anything left over goes to the disciples&#39; wages.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> After I learned about our situation, I felt a bit conflicted. Haha.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> I see, I didn&#39;t realize you were actually Suzuka Gozen. I&#39;m impressed.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> If that&#39;s the case...Fujimaru? That just means you must be some sort of famous [\u2642 sage /\u2640 fairy].</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m just a plain ol&#39; person.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Master&#39;s not really a [\u2642 sage /\u2640 fairy]; [\u2642 he&#39;s /\u2640 she&#39;s] a mage.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;m Tamuramaro.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Master? You shouldn&#39;t use that name so casually around me.</p><hr><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Hee hee. [\u2642 Mr. /\u2640 Miss] Master, is it?</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Is that Dutch? It means...\u201Cmentor\u201D or \u201Clordship,\u201D right?</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> I had a feeling that the people playing Mito Koumon were just messing around...</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> But the fact that a [\u2642 sage /\u2640 fairy] named [\u2642 Mr. /\u2640 Miss] Master is traveling with the real Suzuka Gozen...</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> ...and the fact that my body moved in an unbelievable fashion and my brush danced with surreal movements...</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> ...definitely proves that this is all a real dream...</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Ha. A \u201Creal\u201D dream... Sure sounds odd to say.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Don&#39;t you think so, Suzuka Gozen? Welcome back to the world of the living.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> If it turned out this was all a dream, would you still paint, Oei?</p><hr><p><strong>Oei:</strong> You&#39;re actually stupid, aren&#39;t you, Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Are you seriously asking a question like that to a painter?</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> If you saw a plate of delicious food, even if you were dreaming or the world was ending, you&#39;d still want to eat it, wouldn&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> If a [\u2642 real beauty /\u2640 handsome fellow] appeared in front of you, you&#39;d fall in love and want to do things with them, right?</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Nothing changes. Birds will fly, butterflies will flutter, fish will swim. And a painter will always want to paint, no matter where they are.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Oei...you&#39;re...</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> (Master, I need to talk to you.)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (Suzuka Gozen...?)</p><hr><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Come on, we&#39;re almost there. Hosshou Temple&#39;s right over that hill!</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> ...What&#39;s wrong? Out of breath already?</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> If you&#39;re going to dawdle, I&#39;m going ahead of you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Oei went in the temple...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> So, Suzuka Gozen. What did you want to talk about?</p><hr><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Master. Don&#39;t you think this is all weird AF? Like, something might happen...</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> ...It&#39;s faint, but I sense a divine presence from Oei.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> And it&#39;s getting stronger. When she went into that half-naked courtesan mode... That was just the beginning.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> A divine presence? Are you saying she&#39;s starting to gain Divinity?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> I&#39;m not talking about logic here. My Divine Power is telling me so.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> So we&#39;re in Oei&#39;s dream?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> I can&#39;t say for sure, but that&#39;s probs the correct assessment.</p><hr><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> People talk about \u201Cfalse dreams,\u201D or how if you dream something the opposite will happen, right?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> What that means is that not everything will necessarily go in your favor in a dream.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Sometimes dreams attract things that a person is subconsciously afraid of...things they never want to happen.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Master, you get affected by dreams a lot, right? You should be aware of that by now.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> I have a sense that whatever is happening in this dream is ultimately not good for you.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> If this super realistic and super detailed dream turns into a nightmare...</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> ...we may end up in over our heads here.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Not only would there be mental corruption, but any spiritual injuries we suffer here in the dream could also affect our physical bodies in Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Or, even worse...we may not be able to return at all...</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Yeah...I have nothing but bad vibes about this...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Really? Do you really think so?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I do see that Hokusai was a godly painter, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Hey, I don&#39;t want to flame Oei either...</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> ...but my job is to warn you, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yeah. Thanks, Suzuka Gozen.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> That&#39;s how I roll! And getting advice from a high school girl&#39;s gonna cost you!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> ...Why do you look so surprised?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> When we get back to Chaldea, I&#39;m gonna make a special New Year&#39;s request that&#39;ll be big enough to cover whatever work I do here!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That&#39;s the sort of advice I&#39;d expect from someone wieldinga sword forged by the Bodhisattva of Wisdom.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Riiight!? This is totally helpful and literal Clairvoyance on my part!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> ...Oh, one request though: solve this whole mess quick, &#39;kay?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Don&#39;t make me...draw my sword on one of my own...</p><hr><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Okay! We need to catch up to Oei! Hm? Something on your mind, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Do you think we&#39;re in Katsushika Hokusai&#39;s dream?</p><hr><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Not Oei&#39;s, but Hokusai&#39;s dream?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> ...That&#39;s a good point.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> That would make total sense, as Hokusai himself hasn&#39;t made an appearance.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> So what do you think Hokusai wants to do? Is he afraid that something&#39;s gonna break if he does turn up?</p><p><strong>:</strong></p><p>\u3010Honjo - Yanagishima, Mt. Myouken, Hosshou Temple\u3011</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> So, here we are at Hosshou Temple. Where did Oei go?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Do you think she found Toto-sama?</p><hr><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Master? Over there! Oei&#39;s getting flamed by a real boomer.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> ...Wait, whaaa!? Isn&#39;t that...!?</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong> Oh my. I thought I smelled a fake high school girl lurking around. Should&#39;ve expected you, Suzuka Gozen.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Why&#39;re you here!? You&#39;re totally ruining the vibes around here!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> A-and my high school girl energy is just low because the sitch is so realtalk! I&#39;m in an adaptive mode!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> A kouhai-like character who&#39;s sorta like the final boss!?</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong> Awww, what&#39;s up with that vague explanation!? That&#39;s mean!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong> BB is definitely and always will be the final boss, and I have the aura of a superstrong character...</p><p><strong>C\uFF1A???:</strong> If Senpai&#39;s memory is all mushy like that, then I&#39;m just going to change your thought channels into mashed potatoes\u2606</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> ...BB...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong> It&#39;s BB-chan\u2606 Don&#39;t forget the \u201C-chan\u201D at the end.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...BB-chan!?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong> Yes! Your omnipotent kouhai, the Great Devil BB-chan\u2606 That&#39;s me!</p><hr><p><strong>BB:</strong> They tried to make me play a courtesan who works in Yoshiwara under the name of \u201CSumizome\u201D...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong> ...but never underestimate my special processing power. The moment the calculation spits out void numbers will be the moment I wield my true power!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong> Know that I have resistance against things like character corruption!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong> But...I see... Suzuka Gozen on Master&#39;s side...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong> This is getting interesting... Tee hee...</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Hey, Fujimaru... Is this thing a friend of yours?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong> Thing...!?</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> I have no idea what these guys are talking about, especially this \u201Cbee-bee\u201D one.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> When I mentioned that I was looking for Toto-sama, they suddenly got really angry and started saying that they won&#39;t let me get away with this. Whatever \u201Cthis\u201D is.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Why are you getting in our way?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Who&#39;s BB with...?</p><hr><p><strong>BB:</strong> Huh? Oh, right! Let me introduce you to this guy...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong> So, according to our scenario here, this guy is a playboy who is one of my most loyal patrons. And then there&#39;s his \u201Cbodyguard\u201D...</p><p><strong>D\uFF1APlayboy:</strong> Sumizome...come back here! Don&#39;t just blunder over into that woman!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong> It&#39;s BB-chan! And don&#39;t boss me around!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1APlayboy:</strong> I have business with that individual.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Gilgamesh!?</p><hr><p><strong>Mister Gold, the Playboy:</strong> Fool! Call me Mr. Gold!!! It&#39;s New Year&#39;s, for crying out loud! Where&#39;s your sense of whimsy?</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Mr. Gold, the playboy, you say?</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> You&#39;ve been awfully loud...laughing and shouting like that!</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> You need to be quiet on temple grounds!</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> You and that bee-bee... Why&#39;re you all so high-and-mighty?</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Ain&#39;t there someone in Edo city who I can talk to like a normal person?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1ABodyguard:</strong> I-I&#39;m terribly sorry...</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Oh. You&#39;re awfully quiet...even though you look really valiant...</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> That dignified stance, that melancholy expression... I don&#39;t know why, but I have a feeling I know you from somewhere too...</p><p><strong>Mister Gold, the Playboy:</strong> That&#39;s my retainer and bodyguard, Omoe. At least in this fleeting dream nonsense, that&#39;s how it is.</p><p><strong>Bodyguard Omoe:</strong> S-so there you have it... I am Omoe...</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Fujimaru. Sorry, but this place turned out to be a dud too.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> It looks like Toto-sama isn&#39;t here in this temple either.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> And so we&#39;ve no business here anymore. Let&#39;s just get going.</p><p><strong>Mister Gold, the Playboy:</strong> No. I will not allow that individual to return.</p><p><strong>Mister Gold, the Playboy:</strong> Or at the least, you will stay here, with me, until tomorrow.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> ...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Gil...I mean, Mr. Gold? What do you mean?</p><hr><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Don&#39;t tell me Gil\u2013I mean, Mr. Gold is a part of the Utagawa school scheme, too!? Ugh, I always knew you were a piece of shit.</p><p><strong>Mister Gold, the Playboy:</strong> Nonsense! How dare you throw such plebian insults!!!</p><p><strong>Mister Gold, the Playboy:</strong> I&#39;ve already sent the Utagawa school&#39;s publisher, Hoeidou, to the magistrate&#39;s office!</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Is that true!?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> For real!? That was fast!</p><p><strong>Bodyguard Omoe:</strong> It is indeed the truth.</p><p><strong>Bodyguard Omoe:</strong> Some under-the-table transactions were found to have happened, and it turns out that Hoeidou and other Utagawa-related publishers were involved.</p><p><strong>Bodyguard Omoe:</strong> And as they have been charged with disrupting the peace and morals of the city, they are currently under investigation by officials.</p><p><strong>Bodyguard Omoe:</strong> Their intent and purpose was likely to undermine the currently missing painter, Katsushika Hokusai.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> That&#39;s not surprising.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Is Mr. Gold here because he&#39;s searching for Hokusai too?</p><hr><p><strong>Mister Gold, the Playboy:</strong> Correct.</p><p><strong>Mister Gold, the Playboy:</strong> However, we instead find none other than Hokusai&#39;s daughter, Katsushika Oui.</p><p><strong>Mister Gold, the Playboy:</strong> I do not consider this a coincidence.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> ...Hm?</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> I&#39;m grateful that you took care of some of the issues for us.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;re some kind of chivalrous figure or something, but this isn&#39;t good, Mr. Gold.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> In fact, it&#39;s really bad.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> During tomorrow&#39;s viewing with the shogun, the painters from the Utagawa school were supposed to demonstrate with Toto-sama.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> But you&#39;ve turned them in to the authorities...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong> Oh, I know, me, me! It was supposed to be with the up-and-coming painter named Utagawa Hiroshige, right?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong> He&#39;s very famous even in Yoshiwara!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong> He&#39;s the one who&#39;s released a series of ukiyo-e titled \u201CThe Fifty-three Stations of the Toukaidou!\u201D He&#39;s become indispensable to the Utagawa school!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong> Don&#39;t worry. He&#39;s going to make his appearance in front of the shogun tomorrow.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> What do you mean? Now the entire Utagawa clique sounds sketch to me!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Sending some creeper out in front of the great lord would be such a disgrace!</p><p><strong>Mister Gold, the Playboy:</strong> I agree. But hold your tongue, daughter of the Demon King. If you have sense enough to understand this situation, surely you know what happens next.</p><p><strong>Mister Gold, the Playboy:</strong> Listen, mongrel. Go back to Chaldea. And take that fox-maiden-schoolgirl thing with you too.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> How dare you rate me so low!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong> Because everything about your appearance and behavior is an imitation.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong> On the other hand, BB-chan is one hundred percent pure kouhai, inside and out...from the tips of my toes to the end of my pointer!</p><p><strong>Mister Gold, the Playboy:</strong> What are you talking about? You are a pretender to the position of kouhai! You are the most bizarre imitation present today!</p><p><strong>Mister Gold, the Playboy:</strong> No, enough bickering. Fujimaru. Leave the rest to me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Bodyguard Omoe:</strong> I also, wholeheartedly, ask that you leave. This is for your own good. For your own sake.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> B-but...you can&#39;t just drop that on us like a surprise album...</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Even Oei...</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Go back to...Chaldea...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Mr. Gold, just how much do you know...?</p><hr><p><strong>Mister Gold, the Playboy:</strong> All you need to do is to say the words \u201CI&#39;m leaving everything in your hands.\u201D By doing so, you should be able to wake up from this dream.</p><p><strong>Mister Gold, the Playboy:</strong> Listen well, Fujimaru. This situation we face is a true and dire threat to humanity.</p><p><strong>Mister Gold, the Playboy:</strong> The heretical Demon God Pillar that was separated from the inhuman beast...</p><p><strong>Mister Gold, the Playboy:</strong> ...has bored a hole into the natural laws of this world with its obsession and distress.</p><p><strong>Mister Gold, the Playboy:</strong> And from that Abyss, a dread, eldritch creature peered into the real world, and found the perfect madman.</p><p><strong>Mister Gold, the Playboy:</strong> Namely the extraordinary painter...Hokusai.</p><p><strong>Mister Gold, the Playboy:</strong> Just as Divinity fills the body of a saint for an instant to manifest a miracle....</p><p><strong>Mister Gold, the Playboy:</strong> ...crystalized evil has sought an appropriate vessel to inhabit.</p><p><strong>Mister Gold, the Playboy:</strong> This...entity could be described as an evil god, crawling out of the Abyss. A stain upon the world almost as terrible as BB here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> An evil god from the Abyss...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Ah-ha. I think I&#39;m getting the big picture now.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> So you&#39;re telling me that Toto-sama&#39;s been possessed by some kind of evil, hellish demon-thing?</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Is that why he suddenly disappeared!?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Impossible! That doesn&#39;t even make sense!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> A god possessing a human? That&#39;s like the sun inhabiting a tree branch or something!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> There&#39;s no way a human could stay sane through that! Their mind would burn out in an instant! Like, poof!</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> A fire? No, thanks. They&#39;re fun to watch, but not when I&#39;m the one burning.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong> Burn out in an instant, huh?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong> Do you really think so? I don&#39;t think so.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong> A candle&#39;s wick, for instance, is within the flames, but it continues to glow and doesn&#39;t burn up.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong> Isn&#39;t it human nature to try to push oneself beyond logic?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (...Human...?)</p><hr><p><strong>BB:</strong> Hmmm, for example...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong> A Foreigner...an individual who has descended from superstition...is perhaps something to consider?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong> One who keeps their purity even in the heart of madness. Or perhaps...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong> ...one who is swallowed up by madness, but then turns around and consumes the madness in turn. Such an individual, I believe, could manage it...</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> That&#39;s so cryptic.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Even if that were true, what are you planning to do, Mr. Gold?</p><p><strong>Mister Gold, the Playboy:</strong> It&#39;s obvious! I will break the arm of this dream&#39;s owner...I will render Katsushika Hokusai useless!</p><p><strong>Mister Gold, the Playboy:</strong> So that he will never paint again!</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> !?</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> The hell you will!!! Toto-sama would still paint, even if it meant he had to hold the brush with his teeth!</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> And if he loses his teeth, he&#39;ll paint with his feet! If he lost his legs, he&#39;d paint with his belly button!</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Even if Edo burned to the ground, or if the world ended, it wouldn&#39;t matter!</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> What hogwash. You sure say some terrible things.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> If you dare try to take Toto-sama&#39;s brush, I&#39;ll never forgive you...and I&#39;ll never let you!</p><p><strong>Mister Gold, the Playboy:</strong> Do you fail to see that that unworldly frame of mind itself, was what invited the evil god here!?</p><p><strong>Mister Gold, the Playboy:</strong> I will not allow anything that came from the Abyss walk this land. Just leave everything to me.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Master!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Any dude bro Gil who says things like that is definitely not a Servant of Master&#39;s!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> HE&#39;S the evil god&#39;s underling! Definitely!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s true...Mr. Gold may not be right.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Exactly! I don&#39;t wanna hear any sob stories! And even your theory&#39;s true...</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> As a Heroic Spirit representing this nation, I will not allow the threat of breaking Hokusai&#39;s arm to stand!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I want to see what happens after this dream.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> ...!!! After...Toto-sama&#39;s...dream...</p><hr><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Fujimaru... Thank you.</p><p><strong>Mister Gold, the Playboy:</strong> I suppose fools will always be fools until they die.</p><p><strong>Mister Gold, the Playboy:</strong> Fine. Very well then. I shall take matters into my own hands!</p><p><strong>Mister Gold of the Touyama:</strong> Hey! Mongrels! Open those puny eyes and behold!</p><p><strong>Mister Gold of the Touyama:</strong> You won&#39;t scatter my Spirit Origin like golden cherry blossoms!</p><p><strong>Mister Gold of the Touyama:</strong> There you have it. It is officially your turn to work, BB! Just do some of those special effects of yours!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong> Whaaa!?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong> Wh-what the heck is this!? Whaaa!? Nobody told me anything about special effects!</p><p><strong>Bodyguard Omoe:</strong> That&#39;s right... Cherry blossoms are raining down, thick as snow! This is a Blossom Blizzard!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> So \u201CBB\u201D stands for \u201CBlossom Blizzard\u201D! Finally, a solution to our longstanding mystery!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Actually, isn&#39;t that just a rip-off of my Tower Storm?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong> N-no it&#39;s not! And please stop this!!!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mr. Gold, the Playboy:</strong> Fu...</p><p><strong>Mr. Gold, the Playboy:</strong> Fuhahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> !?</p><hr><p><strong>Mr. Gold, the Playboy:</strong> I see...so that&#39;s what&#39;s going on!!!</p><p><strong>Mr. Gold, the Playboy:</strong> I can&#39;t believe I didn&#39;t realize!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Five seconds ago we were seriously going at it, but he just stopped... Some eureka moment?</p><p><strong>Mr. Gold, the Playboy:</strong> I get it, Oei\u2013or rather, Katsushika Oui. I have witnessed both the doubts and the hidden ambition of your giant brush.</p><p><strong>Mr. Gold, the Playboy:</strong> I cannot clearly see the fate of this father and daughter... As such, I have no right to make a decision.</p><p><strong>Mr. Gold, the Playboy:</strong> Honestly, I am keenly interested in this Foreigner situation as well.</p><p><strong>Mr. Gold, the Playboy:</strong> A nation that treats all visitors and outsiders as evil surely has no future.</p><p><strong>Mr. Gold, the Playboy:</strong> So show me. Which will come first? Will humanity crumble away, or will your singular resolve create a new fate?</p><p><strong>Mr. Gold, the Playboy:</strong> I watch in anticipation!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Are we really in THAT dire of a situation!?</p><hr><p><strong>Mr. Gold, the Playboy:</strong> Of course you are. Enjoy it, mongrel.</p><p><strong>Mr. Gold, the Playboy:</strong> After all, what are humanity and cultural advances worth if one can&#39;t keep a sense of humor?</p><p><strong>Mr. Gold, the Playboy:</strong> A man unparalleled in human history. A man who perfected a pathless road, reaching for the place where truth and fiction meet...</p><p><strong>Mr. Gold, the Playboy:</strong> ...is saying, \u201CWait.\u201D</p><p><strong>Mr. Gold, the Playboy:</strong> That wish must be answered.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> ...Huh!?</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mr. Gold, the Playboy:</strong> Listen. About that exhibition tomorrow...</p><p><strong>Mr. Gold, the Playboy:</strong> I will personally tell the shogun that a painter with great skill will come in place of Hokusai.</p><p><strong>Mr. Gold, the Playboy:</strong> After all, my reputation hangs in the balance as well.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Wha... To the shogun!? A painter... You&#39;re not talking about me, are you!?</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> There&#39;s no way the shogun would entertain such an absurd request! It would take a magistrate of Edo or something to get him to listen...!</p><p><strong>Bodyguard Omoe:</strong> It will be all right. Leave the rest of the arrangements to us.</p><p><strong>Bodyguard Omoe:</strong> And that&#39;s why we would like you to continue protecting Oei, [\u2642 Lord /\u2640 Lady] Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Understood.</p><p><strong>Bodyguard Omoe:</strong> What a dignified response. I like it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What about finding Master Hokusai?</p><p><strong>BB:</strong> If that self-proclaimed (?) Wise King has given up on it, then I suggest you follow suit.</p><hr><p><strong>BB:</strong> (Sigh) I had a feeling I wasn&#39;t going to make much of an appearance...</p><p><strong>BB:</strong> ...but I guess I shouldn&#39;t be surprised, because if BB-chan went all out, this whole thing would be over in a snap, and that would ruin everything.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong> It&#39;s best that Fujimaru take care of it, right? If you want something to flail about, that is.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> I bet you were going to run away when things got hairy!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Why can&#39;t you drop more hints about this Foreigner thing! Come on, if you&#39;re really the almighty kouhai!</p><p><strong>BB:</strong> Ehhh? But that&#39;s such a pain. This isn&#39;t even a story route where I&#39;m the heroine.</p><p><strong>BB:</strong> Why don&#39;t YOU go all out? Huh!? Suzuka Gozen of the True Clairvoyant Eyes!?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Gungh...I didn&#39;t want you to go there...</p><p><strong>Mr. Gold, the Playboy:</strong> Be prepared, mongrel. If you really want to understand Katsushika Hokusai&#39;s abyss...</p><p><strong>Mr. Gold, the Playboy:</strong> ...know that both great madness and slumbering destruction dwell under the same roof.</p><p><strong>Mr. Gold, the Playboy:</strong> Always be mindful of where the stars align. Know that, should you make a mistake, Edo will not be all that sinks.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Thank you for your warning, Wise King of New Year&#39;s.</p><p><strong>Mr. Gold, the Playboy:</strong> Heh. I told you, I&#39;m Mr. Gold.</p><p><strong>Mr. Gold, the Playboy:</strong> I only did what a protector of a city is supposed to do. But you know what...Edo has some interesting architecture... What&#39;s this\u2013a wooden house...?</p><p><strong>Mr. Gold, the Playboy:</strong> Is it made of wood because of the weather? Or is it built with the belief that it is going to be rebuilt soon? Well, I suppose its only weakness would be against fire...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I think Chaldea&#39;ll be fine.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> But if your INT&#39;s high, that&#39;s totally bad!</p><p><strong>Mr. Gold, the Playboy:</strong> Then do as you please.</p><p><strong>Mr. Gold, the Playboy:</strong> Being wise and intelligent are two separate things. There are foolish wise men out there somewhere.</p><hr><p><strong>Bodyguard Omoe:</strong> Well then...um, my lord. Case closed! ...Right?</p><p><strong>Bodyguard Omoe:</strong> Since we&#39;re done with work, should we go out shopping? I saw this board game that seemed pretty new and excit\u2013</p><p><strong>Mr. Gold, the Playboy:</strong> Nonsense, nothing has been concluded yet, fool! You&#39;re so earnest, yet why do you seek pleasure so much!?</p><p><strong>Bodyguard Omoe:</strong> Ouch\u2606 I-I&#39;m sorry...</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> ...Whew. They&#39;re finally gone.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> They were an eccentric bunch, just like how ink can behave unpredictably on paper...</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Oops, how embarrassing. My clothes got messed up when I went berserk again.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Oei...</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Ahaha...what a strange dream. Don&#39;t make that face, Suzuka.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Guess I have no choice. You all hungry? Let&#39;s go home and order some mochi soup, fit for New Year&#39;s!</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Tomorrow is another day. You know the saying...

You&#39;re not wrong.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> But, in certain regions of the country, I hear it&#39;s the January 2 ones.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> After all, Edo has tons of people from so many parts of the nation.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> It doesn&#39;t matter when the first dream is, as long as there&#39;s more opportunity to sell our paintings.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> She&#39;s a bona fide businesswoman.

Hey, you&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> It&#39;s wrapped its tentacles around a brush and now it&#39;s trying to paint on one of Toto-sama&#39;s IOUs.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> (But...it&#39;s a really bad drawing...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (Yeah, it&#39;s pretty bad...)</p><hr><p><strong>Oei:</strong> You&#39;re pretty bad, Octy... I think you should give up.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Ack!</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> What&#39;s the big idea, you dumb octopus!?

Ph&#39;n...glui...?</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> ...Oh. Yeah, it doesn&#39;t mean anything in particular.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> It&#39;s an incantation that Toto-sama began chanting recently.

But, I&#39;m ready. I&#39;ve resolved myself.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> I need to put on makeup, which is something I don&#39;t usually do, so tomorrow&#39;s gonna be an early day. Best to go to bed.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Here! Take this!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> What is this? It&#39;s just a blank piece of paper!</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> You wouldn&#39;t want to have a dream within a dream, right? So instead of having a picture under your pillow...</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> ...you put a blank piece of paper there so your dreams don&#39;t go wanderin&#39; somewhere bad.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Eh!?

What a surprise...)</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> (I thought the exhibition was supposed to be in the great hall. What made him change his mind...?)</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> (Besides...)</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> (So he has finally shown his face... That...Utagawa...Hiroshige...!)</p><p><strong>Utagawa Hiroshige:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Warrior:</strong> The town painter, Katsushika Hokusai&#39;s daughter: Katsushika Oui! Similarly, we have the Utagawa school&#39;s rising hope: Utagawa Hiroshige!</p><p><strong>Warrior:</strong> Both parties, show yourselves!</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Yes!</p><p><strong>Utagawa Hiroshige:</strong> Sir!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Suzuka Gozen...isn&#39;t that...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Take a look behind Hiroshige.</p><hr><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> (Eh? Is that...Da Vinci!?)</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Hmm...that&#39;s probably Toyokuni. He was the most important person within the Utagawa school during the time that Hokusai was at his most active.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Both Hokusai and Oei totally hate that creep!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Looks like all the actors have assembled.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Shouldn&#39;t Da Vinci be the one to perform in the exhibition?</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong> ...Heh.</p><p><strong>Warrior:</strong> Oui... A special nomination from the magistrate in the northern town has allowed you to be here today.</p><p><strong>Warrior:</strong> I have a message from him: \u201CShow off your extraordinary talent. It&#39;s your glorious day to shine.\u201D</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> ...A personal message from the magistrate himself!?</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> I am deeply in his debt.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> I shall express my deep and unwavering gratitude for all that has he done for me in my painting\u2013which I paint with my all my energy and skill!</p><p><strong>Warrior:</strong> Hm. Make sure that sentiment is not lost within your heart.</p><p><strong>Warrior:</strong> Now, let us begin. Both parties, take your brushes and line up.</p><p><strong>Warrior:</strong> Today we have a most suitable theme for our New Year&#39;s celebration. It will be a contest...</p><p><strong>Warrior:</strong> ...of whose Treasure Ship painting is able to fully satisfy our great Shogun&#39;s taste! So give it all you got!</p><p><strong>Utagawa Hiroshige &amp; Oei:</strong> Yes! We will humbly submit to your viewing pleasure!</p><p><strong>\u201CShogun\u201D:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Warrior:</strong> Halt! Both parties, put down your brushes and rest.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> ...Pant...pant...</p><p><strong>Utagawa Hiroshige:</strong> ...This is fine.</p><p><strong>Utagawa Hiroshige:</strong> It was my first time doing a Treasure Ship painting, but I think it turned out pretty good.</p><p><strong>\u201CShogun\u201D:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Warrior:</strong> ...Understood.</p><p><strong>Warrior:</strong> The shogun had this to say:</p><p><strong>Warrior:</strong> Hiroshige, Oui...you both have performed extremely well. Your skills are exceptional, and it&#39;s a shame you two are mere town painters!</p><p><strong>Warrior:</strong> Our lord has also graciously decided to elevate you both to new positions...</p><p><strong>Warrior:</strong> ...with as much prestige as the Kanou school of painters, who continuously served the household of the great Oda Nobunaga himself.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> !?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Y-yay! Way to go, Oei! That&#39;s amazing!</p><p><strong>Utagawa Hiroshige:</strong> Oh? Is this like suddenly getting invited to become a court musician or something?</p><p><strong>Utagawa Hiroshige:</strong> This promotion seems wonderful, but it also feels too good to be true.</p><p><strong>Utagawa Hiroshige:</strong> On that note, what about you, Oui? Are you one to snap up the bait?</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> ...I actually agree. Such a promotion sounds impossible, even if the world were ending tomorrow.</p><p><strong>Warrior:</strong> However...there is one more thing I must add.</p><p><strong>Warrior:</strong> For the next painting competition, the shogun is requesting the contest be done in all earnest...with your lives truly at stake.</p><p><strong>Warrior:</strong> You shall take your brush and paint with your lives hanging in the balance. And those whose paintings do not meet with his approval...</p><p><strong>Warrior:</strong> ...are to commit seppuku! This is why the Sumida River was chosen as the site for the contest!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Wha...!? This isn&#39;t supposed to be a duel between swordmasters!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> An all-out duel...in ukiyo-e painting!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...Isn&#39;t this...supposed to be a dream...?</p><hr><p><strong>Utagawa Toyokuni:</strong> If I may interject... I am Utagawa Toyokuni, and I am in charge of the entire Utagawa school.</p><p><strong>Utagawa Toyokuni:</strong> While this contest has been the utmost honor for us, Hiroshige is a painter who our school has high expectations for.</p><p><strong>Utagawa Toyokuni:</strong> There is no way we can risk losing him now.</p><p><strong>Utagawa Toyokuni:</strong> Therefore, I ask that you allow him to receive assistance...</p><p><strong>Warrior:</strong> Assistance...?</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> ...The hell. What&#39;s the big idea?</p><p><strong>Utagawa Toyokuni:</strong> Oui...you of all people shouldn&#39;t require an explanation here.</p><p><strong>Utagawa Toyokuni:</strong> Paintings by a town painter are made possible through the collaborative efforts of multiple artisans.</p><p><strong>Utagawa Toyokuni:</strong> Therefore, support is even more necessary when there is so very much riding on the work itself.</p><p><strong>Utagawa Hiroshige:</strong> Yes, yes. I like that. I&#39;m more versed in writing music than handling paints and brushes, anyway.</p><p><strong>\u201CShogun\u201D:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Warrior:</strong> The shogun has agreed. Do whatever it takes, as long as fine paintings are created.</p><p><strong>Warrior:</strong> Katsushika Oui. What will you do?</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> This isn&#39;t fair! This is like comparing the reach of someone with a thousand followers versus one with ten!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> D-Da Vinci!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What&#39;s going on!?</p><hr><p><strong>Utagawa Toyokuni:</strong> Heh...what&#39;s wrong? Can&#39;t decide, Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Utagawa Toyokuni:</strong> You do have the option to help out Oei, you know.</p><p><strong>Utagawa Toyokuni:</strong> But if you&#39;re going to participate in this match, your life will be riding on it, too.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Are you...really Da Vinci...?</p><hr><p><strong>Utagawa Toyokuni:</strong> Sure. I&#39;m the Da Vinci that you know SO very well.</p><p><strong>Utagawa Toyokuni:</strong> Because the role of \u201CToyokuni\u201D is played by the one that you yourself think is most skilled in painting.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> My head hurts...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> So, WHOSE dream are we in!?</p><hr><p><strong>Utagawa Toyokuni:</strong> Ah, you already know the answer to that question.</p><p><strong>Utagawa Toyokuni:</strong> This is your dream. Without a doubt, this is your dream.</p><p><strong>Utagawa Toyokuni:</strong> Didn&#39;t you see a bunch of familiar faces playing the parts of the townspeople of Edo? They&#39;re all near and dear to you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> And even...Suzuka?</p><hr><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> H-hey! Don&#39;t look at me like that! I&#39;m different! I would never betray Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Oei... What about her?</p><hr><p><strong>Oei:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Utagawa Toyokuni:</strong> Oei&#39;s just a girl who hasn&#39;t made anything of herself yet.</p><p><strong>Utagawa Toyokuni:</strong> She&#39;s been behaving like a Servant because that&#39;s what you wanted, and you&#39;ve been projecting that on to her.</p><p><strong>Utagawa Toyokuni:</strong> But the one the evil god of the Abyss had set its sight on was always Katsushika Hokusai.</p><p><strong>\u201CShogun\u201D:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Who brought Oei into this dream?</p><hr><p><strong>Utagawa Toyokuni:</strong> Ah...that&#39;s the big question.</p><p><strong>Utagawa Toyokuni:</strong> Let&#39;s review that golden playboy&#39;s words. It was Hokusai himself...Hokusai&#39;s soul.</p><p><strong>Utagawa Toyokuni:</strong> Hokusai desired growth.</p><p><strong>Utagawa Toyokuni:</strong> Even after death, his soul desired to walk the path of the artist, and he rejected being added to the Throne of Heroes.</p><p><strong>Utagawa Toyokuni:</strong> That kind of stubbornness likely opened up an opportunity for someone to take advantage of him.</p><p><strong>Utagawa Toyokuni:</strong> Many of his sketches still remain in the modern world. Mermaids, kappa, water tigers...and the sea devil.</p><p><strong>Utagawa Toyokuni:</strong> It&#39;s quite detailed and realistic... It&#39;s painted as if he actually saw the superstitious creature in person.</p><p><strong>Utagawa Toyokuni:</strong> Yes...</p><p><strong>Utagawa Toyokuni:</strong> He pored over numerous romantic and fabled tales from around the world. He possessed a vast collection of resources. And within that collection...</p><p><strong>Utagawa Toyokuni:</strong> ...it wouldn&#39;t be a surprise if one of the books from overseas was a grimoire of spells on the topic of the Sunken Spiral Castle...</p><p><strong>Utagawa Toyokuni:</strong> The monsters of Edo that Hokusai drew seemed dry, and almost fake. They seemed to pale in comparison to other painters&#39; expansive imaginations.</p><p><strong>Utagawa Toyokuni:</strong> Why? Because he knew. He knew of true evil and horror.</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AUtagawa Toyokuni:</strong> The evil god of the Abyss desires...</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AUtagawa Toyokuni:</strong> Using your dream as the door, the god desires to descend upon Chaldea...into the real world...</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AUtagawa Toyokuni:</strong> ...and this is only the beginning of what&#39;s to come.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> ...Toto-sama... The evil god set his sights on Toto-sama?</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> So Hokusai...died...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Oei...</p><hr><p><strong>Oei:</strong> ...If he&#39;s dead, he should stay that way! He shouldn&#39;t be so bullheaded, trying to dig his way out of his grave!</p><p><strong>Utagawa Toyokuni:</strong> That&#39;s a lie. You&#39;re wavering between your struggle to act all strong and your true feelings from within.</p><p><strong>Utagawa Toyokuni:</strong> Listen, Oui. I&#39;ll be blunt with you. You&#39;re in the way. You&#39;re a burden.</p><p><strong>Utagawa Toyokuni:</strong> It&#39;s become quite clear that the biggest obstacle to the evil god&#39;s plan to use Katsushika Hokusai as a vessel to enter this world...</p><p><strong>Utagawa Toyokuni:</strong> ...is you, Oui.</p><p><strong>Utagawa Toyokuni:</strong> Bad girl. You&#39;re a bad, bad, bad girl.</p><p><strong>H\uFF1AOei:</strong> ...Ungh...</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Da Vinci and the others are getting consumed by the evil god... This is...</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Master, we&#39;re in big trouble! You&#39;re going to get swallowed up by the nightmare&#39;s corroding effects, too!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Suzuka Gozen! Oei&#39;s...!</p><hr><p><strong>H\uFF1AOei:</strong> I get it...</p><p><strong>H\uFF1AOei:</strong> Toto-sama...left me again...</p><p><strong>H\uFF1AOei:</strong> If that&#39;s the case, I have no more regrets...</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Oei! What are you talking about!?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Master! If this is Master&#39;s dream, don&#39;t get weak-spirited...or else you&#39;ll lose!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> And Oei, you&#39;re nobody&#39;s burden!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> You&#39;re the one who&#39;s been preventing the evil god from descending! You...! Katsushika Oui!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Besides, the evil god from the Abyss doesn&#39;t even exist in the first place! It&#39;s just superstition!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> It&#39;s just a super realistic fantasy that Hokusai thought up!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Even that Da Vinci over there isn&#39;t really its pawn!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> It&#39;s just the temporary materialization of Hokusai&#39;s greedy pursuit of madness in this dream!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> The evil god of superstition doesn&#39;t have ambitions! There&#39;s no heart that needs to be fulfilled!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> It is nothing more than a fantasy humans cooked up, something to cling to in their obsession.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> But Oei...! Your feelings...your emotions are REAL!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> That&#39;s why...don&#39;t give in!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Yeah...that&#39;s right!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Don&#39;t disappear! Come back, Oei!</p><hr><p><strong>H\uFF1AOei:</strong> Aaahhh...I...am...</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> ...It makes no sense for the master to interfere in a match between their disciples.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Oei...? No...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...Katsushika Hokusai!?</p><hr><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> Yes, that&#39;s right...individuals of Chaldea. I am Katsushika Hokusai.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Using Oei&#39;s body... He&#39;s...?</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Is that the evil god painter? So she finally gave in to it...and they&#39;ve merged!?</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> Fools! I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s the dragon god of the sea, or the celestial octopus god...!</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> My one and only god is the great Northern Myouken Bosatsu! I ain&#39;t going submitting myself to any others!</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> ...But it&#39;s true that I was susceptible. I was tempted...and that&#39;s how things ended up like this.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> Listen. All of the world&#39;s wondrous nature, up to the last wave of the sea...I&#39;m going to paint with the strokes of my brush.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> That&#39;s my wish. I don&#39;t need no evil god, nor any Holy Grail&#39;s help for that.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> After I sunk deep myself, I finally get it. Think about it...if I turned into a vessel for whatever evil god...</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> ...that thing&#39;s not going to want to paint the world&#39;s nature as it is... It&#39;ll all get painted in its twisted perspective!</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> That ain&#39;t what a true and proper painter is!</p><p><strong>Utagawa Toyokuni:</strong> ...So father and daughter mean to keep lying.</p><p><strong>Utagawa Toyokuni:</strong> To keep painting is your desire. Isn&#39;t that right, Mr. Hokusai?</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> ...Hmph.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> Hey, Old Man Toyokuni. Or rather...Da Vinci...</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> You of all people, who chose the form of that beautiful lady, should understand.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> Oei&#39;s my best disciple.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> After my wife died, she&#39;s always served me as my right hand.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> She&#39;s a great daughter that I&#39;m not worthy to have. So of course I would take her anywhere!</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> Ph&#39;nglui...Ph&#39;nglui...wgah&#39;nagl fhtagn...! That&#39;s the phrase.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> Right before I died, I saw it. The face of the evil god... I took a good look with my own eyes.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> So I&#39;m gonna paint it! I&#39;ll paint a god, and I&#39;ll keep my humanity doin&#39; it!</p><p><strong>Utagawa Toyokuni:</strong> How interesting.</p><p><strong>Utagawa Toyokuni:</strong> Then why don&#39;t we commence this painting contest. Should I be the victor...</p><p><strong>Utagawa Toyokuni:</strong> ...channeling through Fujimaru&#39;s consciousness, I shall reach Chaldea&#39;s Da Vinci...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Is it...using my sense of defeat...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> That&#39;s not happening!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> As long as I&#39;m around, I&#39;m not going to let Master do anything cringeworthy!</p><p><strong>F\uFF1ASuzuka Gozen:</strong> This is my time to shine! I&#39;m putting my high school girl powers to the MAX!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s right, Suzuka Gozen!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Let&#39;s stop this nightmare, once and for all!</p><hr><p><strong>F\uFF1ASuzuka Gozen:</strong> Got it!</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> Ah, what an auspicious sight. She&#39;s like the goddess Benten.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> You&#39;re free to show more skin, you know?</p><p><strong>F\uFF1ASuzuka Gozen:</strong> I don&#39;t have time dealing with pervy old guys! Hurry up and beat up the enemy, and give us back Oei!</p><p><strong>F\uFF1ASuzuka Gozen:</strong> Shout, Tower Storm!!! New Year&#39;s Cherry Blossom Version!!!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>F\uFF1ASuzuka Gozen:</strong> The evil god&#39;s presence...is gone...!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Whew...</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> The fun we&#39;ve had during this New Year&#39;s dream is coming to its end.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> Here you go... I&#39;ll draw you a path home. Think of it as the staircase of your dream.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> Now go home to your Chaldea.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Hokusai...</p><hr><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> You got put through the wringer this New Year&#39;s. No thanks to me.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> There&#39;s no use wanderin&#39; around too much. No more tryin&#39; to bait you with offers too good to be true.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> I need to go pay my respects to the great Myouken. If I take too many stops, I&#39;ll get in trouble.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What&#39;s going to happen to Oei?</p><hr><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> Hm. That&#39;s obviously going to be up to the great Myouken.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> But didn&#39;t I tell you earlier?</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> Oei&#39;s a part of me. As long as I keep painting, she&#39;ll be next to me.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> Unless Oei gets tired of me and leaves, that is! Ah-hahaha!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Whatever, Hokusai! Just turn back into your little Octy form! Give us back Oei!</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> ...Sheesh, you remind me of my late wife, always badgering.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> Anyway, the two of you helped us out. See ya.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Sh-she&#39;s back...</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Oei? You okay? Do you remember our names?</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Yeah...I know. Suzuka, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> I have all my memories, even from when I transformed.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> But...Toto-sama...</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> You turned into such an ugly octopus...though you were never exactly easy on the eyes from the get-go...</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Oooh, no inking! Haha!</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> We weren&#39;t in a dream, but an a even more fleeting illusion.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> Oei...</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Ahaha. Stop it! I hate sad goodbyes.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Come on, Fujimaru! You&#39;re going back to Chaldea, right? Don&#39;t make that kind of face!</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> If you keep hanging around here, New Year&#39;s will end, and this won&#39;t count as a first dream.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> I don&#39;t like downer endings either. But, this is farewell...</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> I&#39;m happy we met. And I had fun.</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> I can&#39;t paint to save my life, so I&#39;m going to take a selfie to put in my story!</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Selfie? What a weird\u2013</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> That looks good!</p><p><strong>Suzuka Gozen:</strong> The background makes the picture shine! By the way, I should introduce you to videos from this lady about room clutter\u2013</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Shut up. That&#39;s none of your business.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Goodbye, Oei.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Thanks so much!</p><hr><p><strong>Oei:</strong> Yeah. Right back at you, Fujimaru. You [\u2642 handsome sage /\u2640 stylish fairy] you.</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> And thanks for reuniting me with Toto-sama. It felt nostalgic...and I was happy...</p><p><strong>Oei:</strong> S-see you... Take care!</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I&#39;m in your debt, Mr. Hokusai.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> Huh? What...you again?</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> Where the hell&#39;ve you been? Or were you just a spectator for all this?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Hey, I&#39;ve done my fair share of helping behind the scene.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> To reach the very depth of the Abyss, I had no choice but to leave my physical body in another place.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Indeed...a certain Demon God had sought out superstition. It tried to have the god from the Abyss descend upon this land...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> This attempt ended in failure, but for an existence that was empty in the first place, the momentary opportunity was enough.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Enough, as far as the course of time and space is concerned, by learning of this earth and merging with Mr. Hokusai&#39;s soul.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> The Demon God has not given up, and it is pursuing another attempt. I did not see or understand this until I was submerged within the abyssal void.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> We must prevent it. But it appears that this is not something that happens in the future, at least not from Chaldea&#39;s point of view...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Well, anyway...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Mr. Hokusai. As unintentional as it may have been, you have spearheaded the Demon God&#39;s conspiracy...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I&#39;m impressed you managed to prevent it from going out of control and rampaging across reality.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> You and Oei have my deepest gratitude. Not to mention the mage of the real world.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...It&#39;s truly a puzzling thing. Someone who is neither a mage nor a fallen saint...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...was able to wield the power of the great evil god, even if it was just a part of it, for themselves...</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> Heh. Demon God, time and space... Your behavior is more far-fetched and nonhuman to me.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> ...Well...I suppose...</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> Let me guess...you&#39;re under the false impression that you&#39;re human. Am I right?</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> That&#39;s beyond superstition. You&#39;re more like an artifice of the world, or the law of nature...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...Hm?</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> Well, no matter.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> Hey...</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> Do you think I...along with those guys...could see more of those phantasmal creatures or beat up more monsters?</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> I bet it&#39;ll give me a boatload of ideas for painting themes, and I&#39;m really interested. What were they called again... Servants?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I thought you weren&#39;t going to use the power of the Holy Grail?</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> Heh. Don&#39;t get smart with me. If I ever had money problems, I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to beg.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> My daughter, the one within me...my little Ago...seems to want the same thing...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> I hardly think this is a situation that can be embraced with open arms...but...</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...nobody can tell what the future holds... I suppose miracles like that can happen.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> I see...heh...</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> Well then, ain&#39;t that just the best New Year&#39;s gift I&#39;ve ever received.</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> ...Ph&#39;nglui...Ph&#39;nglui...</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> ...Ah...to melt and merge to be a part of the mythos... Yeah...I say, bring it on!</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> Falsehood and fiction are all part of my job... I reckon that&#39;s the ultimate dream for an ukiyo-e painter!</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> Whenever the Hokusai family is called upon, it will gladly work for free!</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> ...Isn&#39;t that right, my little Ago?</p><p><strong>Katsushika Hokusai:</strong> ...Fhtagn...fhtagn...</p>',1382),a=[r];function i(g,h){return o(),e("div",null,a)}var p=t(n,[["render",i],["__file","Hokusai.html.vue"]]);export{p as default};
