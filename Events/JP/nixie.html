Even with the numbers that they have currently, they still don’t know how many of them are in total. Trung Nhi notices that we’re just standing here talking, so she invites us to talk at another place. Lambda makes a comparison between the Cons and Passionlip saying that they’re similar but not at the same time.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/c170tuard8s81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=53446926cd1e1524e8de9b184302b2d213afa7de" alt="image"></p><p><strong>==ARROW==</strong></p><p>Da Vinci starts giving the group information about the Trung Sisters.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong></p><p>The Trung Sisters were from the first century AD and northern part of Vietnam.</p><p>During that time, it was under the rule of the Han Dynasty and that district was the Han-Dynasty outpost in Vietnam.</p><p>The ruler who was sent there from the Later Han Dynasty treated people very poorly.</p><p>In the midst of smoudlering discontent and the murder of Trung Trac’s husband, the Sisters took this opportunity to initialize a rebellion…or at least that’s how it goes.</p><p>Wu Zetian is aware of this and that this is the Jiaozhou region and heard about this somewhere in her life since this is a story that was 600 years after the Sisters lived.

The Trung Sisters don&#39;t mind it all with Trung Nhi being a bit embarrassed. Trung Trac asks about the identity of Wu Zetian and Wu Zetian confirms her identity and tells them that the Sisters died 600 years before Wu Zetian was born.</p><p>Ereshkigal assumed that the Trung Sisters hated the other side because of their past, but the Sisters don’t seem to care and Trung Trac explains that the Sisters had to do what had to be done and they don’t seem to mind if an empress was standing in front of them. Trung Nhi threatens Wu Zetian that if she hurts Trung Trac one bit, she’ll cut down everyone here. Trung Trac knows that this is cold, but it’s nice to confirm your values and stances.</p><p><strong>==ARROW==</strong>:</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/rr9utldtd8s81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67c6aeeacedcce71b43204ded9ade82f550f0f15" alt="image"></p><p>You arrive at a village built on water which is where the Trung Sisters live. The sisters say that they were the ones that taught the Cons how to do things like build and were very skilled at it. They introduce you to the “Elder” of this village. Ereshkigal does not find the talking turtle to be very surprising as she refers to how talkative sheep may be. The elder says that Ereshkigal is a bit much for his age and that he prefers someone who is blunt and black haired, while Ereshkigal is jealous that he prefers someone like Ishtar than her.</p><p>Da Vinci asks who this Elder really is and Trung Trac responds that he is this very island. The Elder says that he enjoys talking with youngsters and he jokes with them by ending his sentences with “game”. Trung Trac tells the Elder to take it seriously.</p><p><strong>Elder:</strong></p><p>I am sorry.</p><p>I suppose you’re right. I have lived for a long, long, long time…I think.</p><p>I have forgotten why I am here, here on this sea…</p><p>Though I do remember one thing.</p><p>This land is supposed to be the soil on my back. A seed that has sprouted in the shape of this island.</p><p>In other words, you guys are <strong>standing on top of me</strong> right now.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/8msigqzud8s81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7072e51fac0a7a3229fa8116f48f4f46878f306b" alt="image"></p><p>Everyone is shocked by this revelation. The Trung Sisters want to talk inside a hut instead of the entrance. The Elder says that he’s sorry if it doesn’t really feel like the islands are floating, but he just kept swimming and swimming which became a habit. Da Vinci confirms that it’s true. The Elder reassures that the main body never moves and in a deep state of sleep from which it’ll never awake or it could be dead, but the Elder isn’t sure since he’s here in a very small form separated from the main body. Lambda thinks that he’s a bunrei and the Elder can’t confirm since it&#39;s been too long and now he just wants to bask in the sun along with the Cons. Wu Zetian asks his relationship to the Cons and the Elder has no affiliation with them and that they were harmful.</p><p><strong>Elder:</strong></p><p>However, I do remember this. Not to long ago—</p><p>Frightening creatures from beyond the sea, beyond the fog, started appearing.</p><p>Mashu is puzzled and Lambda wonders if it was the mermen.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/8pcqi9mvd8s81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb4df49d1e4485bc708685426b44b2a09fa48dd9" alt="image"></p><p><strong>Elder:</strong></p><p>No, it’s just not them.</p><p>There were things that possessed hoofs, things that looked like humans. There were a variety of them.</p><p>The thing they had in common was that they were all dwelling sea demons…. They were sea monsters.</p><p>And before I knew it, more and more of these sea monsters showed up and started stealing from the land, living here and devouring the Cons.</p><p>However, when everything was about to be stolen, these sisters had appeared.</p><p>They fought them off, nearly avoiding everything here from being stolen.</p><p>A good way to put this… is that only this area of the region remains.</p><p><strong>Trung Trac:</strong></p><p>Even if it was the last thing standing, I’m glad that we made it in time.</p><p>It wasn’t possible for just the two of us to go on the offensive alone like that.</p><p>But with this, we bought enough time for allies to come forth.</p><p>Da Vinci grasps the situation. Trung Truc says that they believe they were summoned here to save the Cons and can’t think of another reason why they were summoned here. Da Vinci states that this is a microsingularity because there is an anomaly and we need to fix it. Trung Trac says that sea monsters have special characteristics and asks us how we defeated the merman. We say that we just defeated them normally. Before Trac finishes her sentence, Cons are in trouble.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/ahfitdiwd8s81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2b2bab8fd42400fb3f8b8dee2bb0c64283a221b" alt="image"></p><p><strong>==ARROW==</strong>:</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/qmpk8w3xd8s81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c7a9f7c3c8a2bde17fec7d2e5b60207243c15205" alt="image"></p><p>Mashu compares the Trung Sisters as Dioscuri and Anne and Mary.</p><p>The Trung Sisters state that Cons need to do the finishing blow. Killing sea monsters fresh out the sea is fine, but if they eat a Con, they’ll just come back. However if the Cons defeat them, the monster will be defeated and the eaten Con will come back to life. The Trung Sisters continue stating that Cons can sense danger, but can’t do damage. You offer them help and Da Vinci will send in reinforcements since the Rayshifting aptitude seems to be large for multiple Servants.</p><p>Trung Trac politely asks for another favor. She wants to expand this village and wants a roof over the Cons’ heads here. We just have to bring materials and help expand.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong></p><p>We’ll send in a Servant who’s skilled at construction and gathering materials.</p><p>I’ll go ahead with the selection process.</p><p><strong>Mashu:</strong></p><p>Collecting materials and building facilities… It makes me feel very nostalgic.</p><p>This mission would be a breeze for Master!</p><p>Let’s get some materials to add onto the village first!</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/84b4lacyd8s81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a8ea20a959c518af997e54ceb12ae6a2042f4fa" alt="image"></p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/bx3srrvyd8s81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44b292b3423e05e26a5c0fe384a582aa703ace74" alt="image"></p><p>**Construction 1: Adding to the Water Village</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/64dcjhhzd8s81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7bba7cb9d5ad87ae23f9979b7e210664301afeb0" alt="image"></p><p><strong>Semiramis:</strong></p><p>Hou, hou.

She says that the economy is important when it involves large scale projects like this. Wu Zetian doesn’t believe that the Cons are skilled at building. Semiramis praises the Cons that they’re able to move and do this while under her leadership. With that Trung Nhi states that the Cons have a safe place to stay now and relays her thanks. Ereshkigal lets Trung Trac do the planning for specific operations and Trung Trac is nervous, but will somehow manage. The scenes with Mashu tell you to do our best to help rescue the Cons.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/6webjl10e8s81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80690cdf75ffd7a59cb7064b9fde5a8e58408a5f" alt="image"></p><h2 id="section-2-priestly-questions-and-answers" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-priestly-questions-and-answers" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 2: Priestly Questions and Answers</h2><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/v1qobq032ds81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f3bcc5a57f63921e1b63f70d2fa4a74697eb9d1" alt="image"></p><p>Trung Nhi wants to start at places that are close to the village.

She also states that usually one type of species would come through the fog, but now it’s more than one and there’s a sea monster that looks like a human.

She gives them an English greeting which the Cons don’t know since they know the Japanese greetings. Later, the Cons meet Lakshmi Bai and use a greeting that combines English and Japanese greetings. She wonders what kind of language this is and the Cons explain that it is a greeting. She greets in her langage “Namaste” which is a greeting among Hindi speakers.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/8bab8gq1ifs81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2501a4e3533a687289d5374063de4c97947a87c" alt="image"></p><p>Back in the village, the Cons greet you with a greeting that combines all the greetings that they have learned so far. A particular Con with a red ribbon sticks out which you question. Lambda says that it is her number one fan. Da Vinci is interested in the Cons’ culture and intellect since their existence is very unknown. Ereshkigal feels like when one of them knows the plan, all of them suddenly know the plan. In the end it’s still a mystery since we don’t see them all hours of the day and they could have some telepathic ability. Da Vinci says that it is almost time for the scheduled meeting with the Trung Sisters.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/k5svmnj3ifs81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=149ce9c975fb902dfc916d0c0c4df9501df14b41" alt="image"></p><p>Lakshmi Bai and Calamity Jane report that the west and east side of the island is fine with no sea monster rising. Trung Trac relays her thanks and Lakshmi Bai states that security does play an important role.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/eyel7h44ifs81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eeba7d2b49e76d05be99fae46c295e3e8638d7d6" alt="image"></p><p><strong>Calamity Jane:</strong></p><p>Yes.

Trung Nhi proposes a tall watchtower that can see everything on this island. Lakshmi takes this as an opportunity to suggest that Cons assist with taking shifts and if anything happens, they can immediately report it to us. The Cons happily accept, but Trung Nhi wants them to know how to get to safety when something happens. Da Vinci says that they’ll do easy check-ups.</p><p>Now the question becomes, what kind of watchtower they want to build. Da Vinci suggests the Leaning Tower of Pisa. She wants to see it emerge since her older self said that it was complete and that the leaning wasn’t intentional and her artistic soul is tingling. Although it is optional, she just wants to see it.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/2ag942u6ifs81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0751f4b5f36183e9e6c29cfa65be28da94a9a03c" alt="image"></p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/rhee7bi7ifs81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d0d36bc7bb0f8225ae7847cc912f95620fb512a" alt="image"></p><p>Sanzang emerges and proposes a five story Pagoda which she says can bring good fortune. Nitocris appears as well to propose a Pyramid since it is a big structure after all and starts comparing it to Ozymandias who also appears, but he doesn’t mind if they go with any other option, since everything that isn’t built by him is an imitation of his greatness. However, if they manage to build it up to the very finest detail, then he’ll allow it and tell Nitocris to not cut corners if they decide to build it. The scene ends with you selecting what to build.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/epf7uox7ifs81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d69a6769ecef1094e540c80764ae73e96126b74" alt="image"></p><p>**Construction 4 Choice A: Let’s Build the Leaning Tower of Pisa</p><p>Da Vinci is impressed by the architecture even though she’s busy. Semiramis, on the other hand, doesn’t get the beauty of building a tower at an angle. Da Vinci praises Semiramis’s skills and explains that it was due to special circumstances concerning the ground it was built on. Semiramis compares this to a baby sand castle.</p><p>Trung Trac arrives to be stunned by its magnificence and worries that it’ll tip over and fall. Mashu reassures her that it was perfectly calculated so that it won’t fall over. Trung Nhi has a worrisome expression just like her sister. Da Vinci says that it is designed to be climbable as well. Trung Trac says that it’s better to jump off if they’re trying to run away. Some gas is emitted before going to the next area.</p><p><strong>Guda:</strong></p><p>What’s going on, a weird fog…?</p><p>Did it drift from the sea…?</p><p><strong>Trung Trac:</strong></p><p>Be careful, everyone!

You say that the tea is delicious and glad this was made. The Sisters agree with you and go eat some dango. Benienma is also there with you. She says that you’ll be blessed by Buddha. Trung Trac asks if the Cons can work as a lookout and they’re capable of it.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/ewe80axhifs81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ab646cabee2271880dea0f8d24f70f034e45c7f" alt="image"></p><p><strong>Con:</strong></p><p>Perfect, perfect!</p><p>The skies are so close, I can sunbathe all day.</p><p>The roof is the best place to relax.</p><p>The Trung Sisters want to progress to the next area, but a mist comes forth.</p><p><strong>Guda:</strong></p><p>What’s going on, a weird fog…?</p><p>Did it drift from the sea…?</p><p><strong>Trung Trac:</strong></p><p>Be careful, everyone!

Da Vinci is slightly disappointed that she doesn’t get to see the Leaning Tower of Pisa, but doesn’t mind it in the end. The Sisters wonder who it is despite it being Nitocris, but they pet her anyway. Nitocris tells them to stop and says it’s disrespectful. You ask why she’s wearing that and she explains it is to get into the mood of building the Pyramid. She has heard that this building will serve as a watchtower and they are meant to be tall. Nitocris complains and Mashu gets worried, but the Cons don’t mind it and Nitocris allows it. Ereshkigal teases the color of their clothes. The Trung Sisters want to go to the next area but a fog envelops the area.</p><p><strong>Guda:</strong></p><p>What’s going on, a weird fog…?</p><p>Did it drift from the sea…?</p><p><strong>Trung Trac:</strong></p><p>Be careful, everyone!

You arrive at the beach to notice a frog-like sea monster there, thus you begin to fight it like a regular battle.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/mcv7ycwdvks81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b4a93193d6a4a13746ac54a6577b154a14623a7" alt="image"></p><p><strong>==ARROW==</strong></p><p>You defeat one of them and think that they seemed pretty easy, but Trung Trac notices more up ahead.

Ereshkigal seems to think that they have some kind of conceptual blessing among them or increased strength under certain conditions.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/8bjdjwagvks81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3100c90dd5e2ac193603220bec7a158b6932cfa" alt="image"></p><p>Da Vinci has an informant that can provide information about the monster. Who appears on the transmission is Anastasia Summer. Anastasia was getting prepared to go to a tropical island with you in hopes that Viy would get a friend, but you didn’t call for her so she’s mad at you. Anastasia went out of her way to write down potential pranks that she could do in her notebook for when they arrive. She comes to the conclusion that the sea monster that you’re facing is a <strong>Vodyanoy</strong>.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/n1wau1pgvks81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e76a2f3770645eb37417159f70bb8355a111c4d7" alt="image"></p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong></p><p>I suppose that what’s relevant now is that “Vodyanoy prefers to be near water gates and water wheels”, I think?</p><p>I don’t remember the meaning and reasoning behind that. That’s just how it’s told.</p><p>Ereshkigal connects two and two together to come to the conclusion that what the Vodyanoys are building is similar to a water gate. Da Vinci states that maybe if you break that watergate, then their conceptual blessing will disappear. Lambda decides to use her Noble Phantasm to destroy it in order to easily defeat them.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/wbj92qchvks81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79855465c97374eb2eccdbade4f294e1f735508b" alt="image"></p><p>You defeat them, but Trung Trac states that the fog has not subsided and concludes that this isn’t the end. She continues that the fog may continue to exist for a while, but there are times where it’ll come back with the fog being thinner or thicker. Now the problem becomes about frequent attacks when the fog shows up and the attacks are in different locations. Da Vinci concludes that what we need is a Defensive Transportation System.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/1djv7qrhvks81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2881642b45a2244ecfc7b73d49b83249de459948" alt="image"></p><p>Shi Huang Di appears on screen saying that while he isn’t interested in saving the island since it is not his kingdom, he proposes this island’s version of the Great Wall of China since the Great Wall of China can act as defense and a mode of transportation as well.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/ddilrx7ivks81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64a850c99a1243a63e6b802d4f8fffde0a234962" alt="image"></p><p>Thomas Edison arrives and has heard the situation which annoys Shi Huang Di. Edison tells Shi Huang Di that while they do have different ideologies, but when it’s about engineering, he cannot back down. Therefore, he proposes a train network which doesn’t require you to do anything but to get on and relax as the motor vehicle will take you to your destination in no time. He also adds a bonus that the train can carry supplies if needed.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/6twso4pivks81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c1c2ffff4975f64ff89df37bcce41676c0909ed" alt="image"></p><p>Odysseus arrives and has heard the situation as well.

Trung Trac doesn’t have any complaints about it since she can move more smoothly now and the wall acts as a barrier. Trung Nhi is also curious about Shi Huang Di himself.</p><p>Boudica is here to assist you in carrying you around the Great Wall of China. Da Vinci notes that there are too many problems with the Great Wall. You go on Red Hare as he takes you to the location. Red Hare scares Trung Nhi and Boudica snaps at Red Hare.

Although it is one car at the moment, Edison would like to upgrade it to multiple cars. Edison does a final check on the engine and stuff and starts departing and you guys start to relax on the train. The Sisters are fascinated and impressed by such a mode of transportation while the Cons are having fun exploring the train itself. You talk about how eating tangerine is a must on a train, but you don’t know the reason for it which Trung Nhi finds a bit weird. Edison says that it’s unfortunate that while the train’s role is to transport people quickly to their destination, that would also mean being able to relax for just a short while, which Edison is trying to solve right now. We get off and fight the Vodyanoys.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/uyd9lv0mvks81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0769b2d205a255e989cb340110561a07b709179" alt="image"></p><p>**Construction 5 Choice C: Let’s Build a Trojan Horse</p><p><strong>Trung Trac:</strong></p><p>Contact from the watchtower—</p><p>Vodyanoy landing at Operation Section 7 District B, Watergate under construction!</p><p>Odysseus has prepared the Trojan Horse to be fully operational, so you go in. The Sister thinks it looks cute. Ereshkigal asks if it’s supposed to be strong. Odysseus replies that while the Trojan Horse on the island resembles his Noble Phantasm, it doesn’t mimic its strength and while its mobility is inferior to that of a horse, its job is to catapult them to the desired location and approach them on foot at high speeds. Da Vinci also compliments it.

Mashu closes it off with the horse eating anyone that dares comes close to it.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/bjh4lchaass81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7033c9406a32d08ac573c7435c71038070221496" alt="image"></p><p>The Cons are going towards the horse wanting to ride it, but in actuality they’re being eaten by the horse. Lambda stops her number one fan from being eaten as well. Da Vinci notes that Kelpie draws in their pretty through some kind of hypnosis of people trying to ride it. According to legend, if you get onto a Kelpie, you’ll never be able to get off of it. You retreat back to the village to think of a strategy to defeat this sea monster.</p><p>Back at the village, Da Vinci says that Cons like to ride something and assume this is something that they were born with. Nhi says that they enjoy using stilts and the Elder mentions that they loved riding on the back of his shell. Da Vinci proposes that they should build a cooler ride so that they won’t be persuaded to think that riding a horse is better than what they’re going to make for the Cons, so they decide to build transportation for the Cons.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/obfwdqzaass81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=36275dc164d5f926b541eeb4dedae1532b908b38" alt="image"></p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/fmsac6rbass81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cfacf2f6c02e119abd7593099fa492f9848b881a" alt="image"></p><p>Carmilla emerges and says that it doesn’t matter what you guys build as long as it mimics the horse. She makes the analogy that if you were a thief and you saw something that made you excited and thrilled that you’d have it, you’d take it. Voyager says that it’s almost like a Super Car.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/kx0ava8cass81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=874dcf3b042670095360236bf567b67f5272e872" alt="image"></p><p>Europa emerges and proposes a cow. Parvati agrees and says that they are simple and divine at the same time. She continues to say that while it is difficult to make a real cow, you’ll just have to go with a mechanical cow.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/hbeo56ncass81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=076996396bbcbb083403c5b1d6f70f51cdf05f7a" alt="image"></p><p>You also think about other modes of transportation which makes you think of Gilgamesh and Arjuna Alter. You say that there are other mysterious modes of transportation like flying. With that, you choose which mode of transportation the Cons will take.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/i3ww6p2dass81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67d7b30d182fd34182689a495a7d2296b7ccaa6a" alt="image"></p><p>Construction 6 Choice A: Let’s Ride a Super Car</p><p>Mashu states that cars don’t really fit with the jungle terrain. Carmilla has given every Con a mini Super Car. Carmilla says that there’s unfortunately a lot of water areas so it’s hard for them to turn and such. If it were her driving her own car, she’d knock down all the trees, but says that she should’ve made it more aquatic. This makes the Kelpie confused and works successfully and Carmilla concludes that the Super Cars are cool and stylish and says that who’d choose a cow over a car.</p><p>Construction 6 Choice B: Let’s Ride a Mechanical Bull</p><p>Europa tells them to go and be careful and the Cons enjoy it very much which makes Parvati and Europa very delighted to see and hear that. Parvati says that bulls are a symbol of strength, grace and endurance. Parvati mentions how bulls are mentioned all over the world like with Iskandar. Wu mentions Nezha, Taigong along with the five-colored divine bull. The Sisters think about how cute the bulls are and think about elephants and how they’re also similar to bulls. You seem to confuse the Kelpie and the Cons can now deal the final blow.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/c53sp76gass81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a368d384ca7bb76e6cca900ba9dcea86b4409036" alt="image"></p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/f9q0bgqgass81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e7f6e9e2de0a59436a5349d7985b775624e13c09" alt="image"></p><p>Construction 6 Choice C: Let’s Ride a Vimana</p><p>Trung Trac asks what kind of vehicle it is and you reply that it is a Vimana. Trung Nhi still doesn’t get it and you reply that it’s a work of mystery. Da Vinci says that this is an imitation and works very differently to the original, but a certain person wouldn’t allow it.</p><p>Da Vinci had other Servants do a rush job for this Vimana which included Tesla and Moriarty who retired halfway. The downside to this vehicle is that it can’t fly up that high since it&#39;s set at a certain elevation and can go horizontally. The Cons fly around the Kelpie showing it that it won’t be drawn in by the sea monster and are capable of finishing it off.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/qv83yenhass81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c66e6f68ae96044cc66d3b9f32f2095c9946995" alt="image"></p><h2 id="chapter-11-third-area-recapture-battle" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#chapter-11-third-area-recapture-battle" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Chapter 11 - Third Area Recapture Battle</h2><p>Just kill the Kelpie.

She continues that it’ll have all the Japanese formal rooms and dishes and if there’s a fire, just jump into the water since there’s exits already available. MHX can’t think of aquatic building, but proposes a colony ship since space is better than water. She adds that there’ll be functions for life in the case the planet dies.

Everyone seems to enjoy the story that Scheherazade puts on which is just horror and exciting stories. After that, Mata Hari puts on a dance show for everyone. Charlotte Corday is next to put on a magic show for everyone. For the end, Nero concludes everything and Elizabeth puts on a musical which the scene ends with a To Be Continued.</p><p>**Construction Quest 8 Choice B: Let’s Build a Game Center</p><p>Hinako, Osakabehime and Tomoe Gozen state that there are a variety of games in different genres. Tomoe is shocked that she didn’t account for the size which Hinako demonstrates that the Cons are playing together with one using the levers and one using the buttons. Tomoe will make adjustments later to fit the Con’s size. The Trung Sisters try to play some games, but are more suited with physical games like air hockey. Trung Nhi makes a new record in shooting the goal but she mistakenly tossed a Con which she is extremely sorry for.</p><p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/0eb7m5bcm5t81.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26602c12e2e2bb2c16ed915edae7a9ee66cfe2d3" alt="image"></p><p>**Construction Quest 8 Choice C: Let’s Build a Library</p><p>Murasaki Shikibu states that she would have helped with the construction if she had time.

Murasaki Shikibu has done some research on the Trung Sisters and is surprised by how much there is about them. The Cons asks Murasaki Shikibu if she has a book for them and says that she has a picture book for them.

However, in order to get to these areas, you’ll need a boat with navigation and combat.</p><p>Drake, Blackbeard and Bartholomew recommend a pirate ship since it has combat. However the three of them have differing opinions on what kind of ship it’ll be. Mordred wants a hovercraft. Hokusai proposes a utsuro-bune which she was inspired by old books. Trung Trac was dozing off during suggestion time, but it’s always up to you to decide.</p><p><strong>Construction 9 Choice A: Let’s Embark on a Pirate Ship</strong></p><p>Drake is amazed by how smart the Cons are with how they built this ship. Mashu asks what the ship’s name will be and they want to mash up all the names, thus, The Queen Anne’s Golden Royal. Drake says it should be the Golden Royal’s Revenge. Bartholomew says it should be the Royal Anne Hind Mekakure Fortune which Drake cannot believe that there’s someone stupider than Blackbeard himself.</p><p><strong>Construction 9 Choice B: Let’s Embark on a Hovercraft</strong></p><p>Mordred is impressed and says that it’s smoother than surfing.

Da Vinci likes the mystery since Hokusai states that a exotic woman held the mysterious box and that the ship was found in the Edo period. They speculate that the box could be something sentient and Da Vinci ends it off with that the woman never let go of the box and let anybody near or touch it.</p><p>People never tried to understand the woman and she was exiled back into the sea. Da Vinci tells Jeanne Alter Lily that mysteries should stay mysteries and Hokusai doesn’t care as long as it appears good for her.</p><h2 id="chapter-16-night-before-the-decisive-battle" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#chapter-16-night-before-the-decisive-battle" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Chapter 16: Night Before the Decisive Battle</h2><p>You wake up in the middle of the night to take a walk in the village when you encounter Trung Trac.
