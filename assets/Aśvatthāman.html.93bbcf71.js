I guess being angry might make fighting a little easier for me.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> In that case, it would most likely behoove you to remain angry during battle.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> That being said, if this anger is having a negative affect on your mind...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> ...then we cannot simply ignore it. I suspect Master feels the same way.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Yeah... That&#39;s true. I nod along in agreement.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Anger and rage are necessary emotions for anyone. We Servants are no exception.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Indeed, I&#39;m sure that some heroes were only summoned here due to feats that were driven by righteous anger.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> However, anger also requires fuel.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> It costs both physical and mental energy to be angry.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> So it is surprisingly difficult to remain in a perpetual state of either anger or grief.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Is that not the case for you?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I cock my head and think about Chiron&#39;s question.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>He&#39;s right. It is difficult to stay perpetually angry.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>But for some reason, I still have plenty of anger to go around.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Hmmm. What about the strain it puts on your mind?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>...I don&#39;t know.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> You don&#39;t know?</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> So you have no idea whether your anger puts any strain on you whatsoever?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I nod.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> This emotion\u2013this burning, all-consuming rage\u2013has never been a burden.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>If anything, it&#39;s only given me energy to spare.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>It keeps my mind constantly elated, to the point where I don&#39;t even realize I&#39;m tired.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Very good. In that case...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> I think we&#39;d better talk to Master.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> So now, I need your advice! What should I do? Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You three make, um...quite the combination.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Hahaha, I suppose we do.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> We may all be Archers, but we come from very different times, regions, and cultures, to say the least.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I feel like I&#39;m looking at RGB personified.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> As in red, green, and blue? ...Yes, I suppose I can see that.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> I guess I must be green, Chiron blue, and A\u015Bvatth\u0101man red.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Though it&#39;s still hard to say as to whether we complement each other or not.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I see...</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> It&#39;s not healthy for me to always be angry all the time. That makes sense.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> But right now, I can&#39;t do anything unless I&#39;m angry. At least, I think so.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But, um, aren&#39;t we talking normally now, without you being angry?</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> I can keep it in check for a little bit.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> But that&#39;s not the same thing as getting rid of it completely, right?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Besides, we wouldn&#39;t be here asking for help if this issue could be managed by simply having him keep it in check.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> Exactly.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Do you want to keep your anger in check?</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> Well, I definitely want to do something about it before I end up making trouble for someone...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> So you wouldn&#39;t rather just stay the way you are?</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> I don&#39;t think this is a good way to be. It&#39;s not natural to be angry all the time.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Maybe you should talk to P\u0101rvat\u012B. She might have a good idea.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> Ulp.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> ...Sorry, Mash, but I&#39;d really rather not do that.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> It&#39;s like, uh... How can I put this...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You don&#39;t want to ask your mom for help now that you&#39;re grown up?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Hahaha. That&#39;s certainly one apt way to put it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You don&#39;t want to worry her?</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> Basically. Please, I&#39;m begging you here!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Keeping anger in check... What about facilitated relaxation?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You could try forest therapy to calm your mind, get a massage to relieve the tension in your muscles... I&#39;ve heard things like that can work wonders for relaxing!</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> I got no idea what the hell forest therapy&#39;s supposed to be... But okay, let&#39;s give &#39;em a shot!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> All right, let&#39;s do it!</p><hr><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> I think I will come with you then. What about you, Tristan? Will you be joining us as well?</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Forest therapy... I like the sound of that. I was just thinking I could use a good nap.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> No sleeping during therapy.</p><hr><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Yes, Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Okay then, I&#39;ll go get the simulator ready!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Forest therapy.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> They say it&#39;s a kind of, well, therapeutic treatment that involves going into a woods to relax.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Apparently, it&#39;s all &#39;cause of things like phytoncides and air quality and a change of environment and such.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Well, if nothing else, it ought to be good for the mind.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Except...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...it doesn&#39;t seem to work that well in dense South American jungles.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> Frick, it&#39;s hot here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m sorry. I think I got one of the settings wrong...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> So much for taking a nap.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Hehe. Now that I take a closer look, I can see there are all sorts of insects happily buzzing about the air here.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Well, I can&#39;t actually see them, since I&#39;m too scared of bugs to open my eyes, but I can still sense them.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;re scared of bugs!?</p><hr><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Yes. I&#39;ve always hated bugs. They just look much too much like fairies for my liking. That, and vampiric horses...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Oh? I&#39;ll have you know that some insects are actually very nutritious. They&#39;re essential eating when it comes to wilderness survival.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> What? You mean some people have to eat bugs to survive? I can&#39;t even imagine it... So I won&#39;t. I&#39;m just going to pretend I never heard that...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> I see. Well, you certainly don&#39;t HAVE to eat them, especially if you have access to meat, fruit, and veggies.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> Never mind that. What do we do about this?</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> Forget about relaxing! All this heat and humidity&#39;s only cranking up my anger energy!</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> Good, perfect timing! Sorry guy, but like it or not, I&#39;m taking my anger out on you!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Here, let us help.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A-all right! Initiating simulation battle!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> Eat this!</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> Dammit. I thought that might help get my anger under control...</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> But thanks to how damn hot these things were, I&#39;m more pissed off than before!</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> I&#39;m sorry to hear that.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> In that case, I think it&#39;s time we tried some real forest therapy.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> I would appreciate that. I don&#39;t think I can stand much more of this heat, either.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> R-right.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Okay, I&#39;ll make sure to set the next environment to a proper forest that you can use for therapy.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> That&#39;s it. This is just what I had in mind.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> It really is peaceful here. Forests are green, and of course, I am synonymous with green.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Really? &#39;Cause when I think of green, I think of Robin Hood.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> No, it&#39;s me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (He really doesn&#39;t want to let this go!)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Isn&#39;t Chiron more closely associated with green?</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> ... ...(Zzz).</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> Stop sleeping!</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Oh, I wasn&#39;t sleeping. That&#39;s just the sound I make when I&#39;m not ready to admit defeat.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> Uh...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> When it comes to Tristan, I&#39;ve found it&#39;s best to just not think about him too hard.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> ...Gotcha...</p><hr><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> All right, since there don&#39;t seem to be any Demonic Beasts nearby, let&#39;s try some deep breathing exercises to complement the forest therapy.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> Got it.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Okay everyone, line up, please.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Now, let&#39;s take some deep breaths. Inhale...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Exhale...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Inhale...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Exhale...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Inhale, then expel all of your breath at once, building up power throughout your entire body...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> And stick out your fist...</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> Ha!</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Hra!</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> ...How&#39;s that supposed to help us relax?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> I&#39;m sorry. Old habits. All right, let&#39;s try meditation next.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You ready?</p><hr><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> Hell yeah!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Start by sitting down in a comfortable position, then close your eyes.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Now, look for the source of your anger.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> That statement takes me a little by surprise.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Anger... The source of my anger.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> That cowardly plot, unbefitting of warriors. The enemy army that decided to carry it out.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> My pathetic self, unable to stop it. My comrades, falling one after another.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> That was why I got so mad that I broke the rules of warfare and massacred them during the night.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> That&#39;s not the only reason.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> That statement sends me reeling. I want to jump down his throat...but I resist.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Anger like that would never last the way yours does. There must be something more to it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You mean he&#39;s angry at something else?</p><hr><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> I...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Yeah... He&#39;s right. I mean, I really was angry back then...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> But the anger I feel now is different. It takes over my whole body, tormenting me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Where does this anger come from? What in the world is it?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> That anger isn&#39;t right for you.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> If it were, you would be able to understand it.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...This anger isn&#39;t right.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Is it the anger I felt for being punished? ...No, it&#39;s not that.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I agreed with that punishment. In fact...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I remember thinking it didn&#39;t go far enough.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> That&#39;s right. I wasn&#39;t punished enough.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I&#39;ve never felt like I fully atoned for what I did. I just kept wandering around wearing myself down until the next thing I knew, I was a Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I remember thinking I was sure I was going to keep being punished.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> And yet...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> That&#39;s right. Chaldea&#39;s way too good for a sinner like me.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> I see it now.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> I&#39;m angry at myself.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> I&#39;ll never be able to atone for what I did in a paradise like this.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> ...You&#39;re wrong.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> That&#39;s it. That guilt is the indescribable source of your anger.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> That rage you feel towards yourself is what you need to fight!</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Concentrate. You&#39;re a warrior, are you not?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Then you should be used to fighting yourself.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Yeah. I am. But...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...I&#39;m not at all confident I can win.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> After all, I&#39;ve been holding on to this anger for thousands of years.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Hahahaha. No need to worry about that.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Did you forget who&#39;s there beside you?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...Yeah. Good point. In that case...</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> So Master, I hate to ask you this...but would you mind giving me a hand fighting my own redemption?</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> Listen well, my millennia-old anger. I will vanquish you in the name of duty.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> I&#39;m here to help save humanity. To help set it right. It&#39;s natural to be angry at any and all injustice.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> But in your case...you&#39;re much too big for a simple archer like me to carry by myself.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> So it&#39;s time for us to go our separate ways, even if it should cost me my life!</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> Here I come!!!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> All right! We won!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> B-but I didn&#39;t do anything...</p><hr><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> ...I see.</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> As a first-rate warrior, he must be able to simulate a battle where you were there giving him orders, Master.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Well? Is your anger gone now?</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> It&#39;s not that simple.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Perhaps not, but you can tell your relationship to it has changed, no?</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> Yeah, I can.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> My anger wasn&#39;t just directed at other people. It was also directed at me.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> And just being aware of that makes a world of difference.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> Thanks, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Uh, you&#39;re welcome, but I really didn&#39;t do anything!</p><hr><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> Hahahaha!</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> And so\u266A His Master\u266A</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Birthed a new legend\u266A By winning despite doing nothing\u266A</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> Ahh, how very jealous I am\u266A Strum strum, strum strum\u266A</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Would you please stop singing that song already!?</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> I&#39;m sorry. Your bewildered face was just so amusing that I couldn&#39;t help myself.</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> That&#39;s enough, Sir Tristan! Zip it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Ugh! Stupid Tristan!</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> I see. Insults, is it? Well, that&#39;s okay. They don&#39;t bother me\u266A</p><p><strong>Tristan:</strong> For a poet is not truly a poet\u266A Unless they are also a nuisance\u266A</p><p><strong>Gareth:</strong> You&#39;re not even the least bit sorry, are you, Sir Tristan? I never could tell what you&#39;re thinking.</p><hr><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> How are you, A\u015Bvatth\u0101man?</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> You know, I&#39;m doing all right.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> The time I&#39;m spending here in peace, laughing and having fun with these guys I now call my friends... That&#39;s all the atonement I need.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> And it&#39;s not unpleasant for me, so I&#39;m not gonna ruin the mood.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> My suffering&#39;ll last as long as I live, but I&#39;ll also be able to enjoy the good things in life.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> &#39;Cause they&#39;re both perfectly valid ways for me to be who I am.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Wonderful. That answer was so good I&#39;m tempted to give you an A+ on your report card.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> Thanks, but there&#39;s no way I&#39;m going back to school at this age.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> ...Then again, maybe that wouldn&#39;t be so bad...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Well, if you&#39;re ever in the mood for a lesson, I&#39;m always accepting new students.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> Hm?</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> ...Thank you for everything.</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> I hope my uncertainty, and my anger, always remain in their proper place...</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> ...and that you will continue to watch over both myself and Master...</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> ...Lady P\u0101rvat\u012B.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong> ...Thank goodness. It seems there was no need for me to get involved.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong> Seeing them grow, inspire, and motivate themselves like this is the greatest reward I could ask for.</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong> Now then, I think I&#39;d better check in on someone else who could use a little motivation!</p><p><strong>P\u0101rvat\u012B:</strong> You can&#39;t just spend every day doing nothing but playing video games, after all!</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> So tell me, Master: What is it you&#39;re angry about right now?</p><p><strong>A\u015Bvatth\u0101man:</strong> Whatever it is, I know you&#39;ll have a good reason to be angry over it.
