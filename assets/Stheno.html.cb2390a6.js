The purpose of this request is different from before.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> What I want to ask you is to hunt down the one who wrecked the place where I hid the treasure.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> The place is, yes, where I previously materialized. The Shaped Isle\u2013in the 1st Century.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I remember. It&#39;s a tiny island in the Mediterranean Sea.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> Yes. On that island, I hid away many treasures.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> I thought I could go reclaim them if I was summoned as a Heroic Spirit again, like now.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> But when I went there to check things out, the peaceful paradise was no more.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> I&#39;m sure back in the 1st Century some wretch dug the treasures up.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I...see?</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> As far as I can tell, the culprits most certainly are undead monsters.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> What do you say, everyone. You just need to drive them out of that place.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> Can&#39;t you do it for me? Doctor Romani?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Wh-What? Me? Why would you ask me? Ahem.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> If it&#39;s the request from the beautiful goddess Stheno, I&#39;d love to accept it, however\u2013</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Back at the Second Singularity, you asked us something really unreasonable...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> We just figured... This time is going to be the same...</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> Oh, what a shame. Can&#39;t you do it, for me?</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> Hey, Fujimaru. My master. It&#39;s my request, you&#39;d do it for me, right?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fou fooou. Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Just like the Doctor said, Senpai.

Senpai, you are her master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Of course, goddess!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Wretches are unforgivable!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> S-Senpai!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Okay, if that&#39;s the case, I&#39;ll help you, too!! Rayshift preparations! Complete! Looking good!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Even you, Doctor! Can it be Stheno&#39;s Charm skill!?</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> Heheh, can you not call it a skill, please? It is exactly what I am.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> I am a goddess. I am a phenomenon born with the wish to captivate any and every hero.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> Like I said. I&#39;m sorry about it, but.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> Please, come with me. I&#39;m sure it will be a very fun event, so do your best.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I feel the phrases &quot;very fun&quot; and &quot;do your best&quot; sound contrary to one another\u2013</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Commence Rayshift!

This is the Mediterranean island we visited before...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> How is Senpai doing...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What? Why are we on an island?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Weren&#39;t we in Chaldea?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Looks like you&#39;ve regained sanity. I&#39;m glad.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We&#39;re on the Shaped Isle in the 1st Century, which we visited during the correction of the Second Singularity.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai, this is due to you and the Doctor accepting to take on Stheno&#39;s &quot;request.&quot;</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So...Is there anything else I need to explain?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s okay, I remember now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Now that you mention it...</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Let&#39;s go, guys! According to Lady Stheno, she hid the treasure in a cave!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It&#39;s that cave we entered before. You know where it is. Well, be on your way!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Looks like Doctor is still charmed.

Then the real culprits are...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I-I&#39;m sure that&#39;s it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That&#39;s good to hear, no problem at all!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Not, not exactly\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> &quot;We are the culprits&quot; here! As I thought, Stheno was pulling a prank on us!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Go home, go home! We won&#39;t give you the treasures, go home!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Woooo! Lady Stheno, woooo! We won&#39;t forgive the intruders!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Charm works even on undead monsters...

Senpai, Medusa is pretty serious!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> We have to do it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> If you ask me, it can&#39;t be helped!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, Master! ...Commencing anti-Servant combat!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> ...I lost.

You really have to train much more, Medusa.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> Always doubt things that sound too good to be true, yes? Me, do something that would delight you? Such a thing\u2014</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> Has it ever happened, even once...!?</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> Ah...You are soooooo right! How convincing you are...!</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> Come on, Fujimaru, let&#39;s fight! I&#39;ve never had so much fun fighting a Servant before!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I do pity Medusa, but this must be the fate of those who meddle with goddesses...</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> Uh...My split self&#39;s out of magical energy too...</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> Extremely... Tired...I used all I had...</p><p><strong>Medusa:</strong> Big Sister doesn&#39;t care about how much magical energy she uses...</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> Heheh. Don&#39;t worry, I didn&#39;t consume any of mine.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> But it is really delightful. My original self doesn&#39;t have the strength to fight...</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> But I can fight if materialized as a Servant.

I&#39;m really sorry, if you die.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, foou...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai, hold on! Senpai...!</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> Wait. I have to tell you before you pass out. Unfortunately, there is no treasure chest this time.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> It&#39;d be boring if it was the same every time, right? I didn&#39;t want to disappoint you, but...</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> I found a different treasure. Sometimes it&#39;s good to fight like a tomboy.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> Well, just like what &quot;Euryale&quot; said. ...I can get used to this, heheh.</p><p><strong>Stheno:</strong> So, I&#39;ll fight with everything I have next time, Master. Please make a full use of my even more charming Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> More important than that, Senpai!
