I need to talk to you.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Oh, hey, Asclepius. We almost never see you here in the Command Room. What&#39;s up?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Hey there!</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> Oh, you&#39;re here too, Master? Perfect.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Is somebody here not feeling well or something?</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> Oho. I appreciate your keeping an eye out for clinical trial opportunities to help me further my medical research, Master.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> But no, I&#39;m here about a different matter today, since there doesn&#39;t seem to be anyone here who I could call my patient.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> Indeed, everyone here seems to be perfectly healthy, unfortunately.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You never change, do you? ...So what&#39;s up?</p><hr><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> It&#39;s about the infirmary.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> I appreciate the permission to use it, but I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s a little hard to use efficiently as it is now.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> Would you mind if I restructured it?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> What do you mean, \u201Crestructure\u201D?</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> I mean I&#39;d like to reorganize the medicine cabinets and change the instrument layout.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> If it were my room alone, I&#39;d have already done so, but as I&#39;m technically renting it, I thought it right to ask.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Ah, okay. Hmm... Yeah, sure, I don&#39;t see why not.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Besides, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be using it more than anyone now that you&#39;ll be handling the medical treatments around here.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> We&#39;re all counting on your expertise, Mr. Greek God of Medicine.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Thanks a bunch for coming here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What she said!</p><hr><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> Hmph. I need as many cases to study as possible if I&#39;m going to advance my research as far as it can go.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> And being here should let me do that. It&#39;s a simple matter of you scratch my back, I scratch yours.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> There&#39;s no need to thank me, or even to expect much from me.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> Hehe... I can&#39;t wait to try some cutting-edge therapies I&#39;ve been thinking about on the patients about to come my way!</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> Don&#39;t worry, I guarantee you their maladies will be cured. I can&#39;t assure anything else besides that, though.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Well, we know your medical skills are top-notch, so I&#39;m not worried about that...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I just wish you would do something about your more mad scientisty tendencies...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (Said the brilliant inventor whose genius literally can&#39;t be measured...)</p><hr><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> Oh, and one more thing. I also wanted to ask you about the old exam records.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> Given the obvious gaps, there must be more besides the ones kept in the infirmary, no?</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> I&#39;m guessing the missing records are those of Servants that have been summoned here, not Chaldea staff.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> For Servants, I imagine you recorded things like what sort of symptoms they showed, and what spiritual measures were taken to treat them.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> Those medical techniques may be limited in scope, but they could still be of use when it comes to progressing human medicine.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> So as someone dedicated to advancing the science of medicine, I need to know what they are.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...Hmm.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> Were those gaps in the data left there intentionally?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It&#39;s more that I just haven&#39;t transcribed that data yet, either on paper or digitally, for various reasons.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I did manage to bring it with me when we escaped from Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But then, once we&#39;d made it here to the Wandering Sea and had a chance to catch our breath...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...I just didn&#39;t feel right about leaving files containing such data in the new infirmary.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Then one thing led to another, as it so often does around here, and I just kind of ended up leaving it where it was.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> So then, it does exist, but it&#39;s being kept somewhere else? Why?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Nnn... Well, basically, it all comes down to privacy.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I mean, medical history, especially anything to do with mental health, is obviously closely tied to a Servant&#39;s past, trauma, and major life events, right?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It&#39;s one thing if it&#39;s basically public knowledge, but sometimes, there are things that were lost to the history books. Things in a Servant&#39;s past that they want to keep absolutely private.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Something so painful they could wind up flying off the handle and try to kill whoever found out. Even Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> True, that has happened before...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Hey, I can&#39;t help that my dreams are so weird.</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...And that&#39;s not all.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Exam records like that don&#39;t just reveal things about the patients, but about the doctor who examined them, too.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> In this case...the former head of the infirmary.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Your predecessor, basically.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> Yes, I know someone else used to hold my position.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> I&#39;ve heard some stories about him, and I&#39;ve also seen records attesting as much in the infirmary.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Sure, that kind of surface-level information is fine, since it can&#39;t cause anyone any harm.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But once it was clear to my previous self that she was going to have to leave the old Chaldea...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...I think she must have thought a lot over how much of his data to include in the report to the Association.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> And the data she archived while she was thinking about what to do is the exam data you&#39;re looking for.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> Hmm. So, to summarize:</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> The old exam data on the Servants includes sensitive information about both those Servants and the former head of the infirmary who treated them.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> And that&#39;s why you don&#39;t keep it in the infirmary.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> But be that as it may, I still need that data. And it&#39;s not like I want it out of mere curiosity or nosiness.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> The information past doctors recorded about their patients is the most valuable information a new doctor treating those patients can have.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> It will help future exams go more smoothly and enable me to develop or refine more treatments. I need to be able to access it.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> Where can I find it?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Well, it was split up into magecraft fragments...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...that were then attached to other Servants who were using the infirmary to treat patients before you.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But don&#39;t worry, it shouldn&#39;t be hard to restore. All you have to do is ask them for access.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That said, you&#39;re still pretty new here, and I&#39;m sure there&#39;s still plenty of Servants you haven&#39;t met yet...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...so it might be a good idea if Fujimaru went with you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Just what I had in mind.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I got this!</p><hr><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> I can&#39;t imagine why I would need Master&#39;s protection only to ask for access.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hey, you never know. It might be a lot more challenging than you think.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> You might not be the new infirmary head, but you&#39;re definitely looking to be its star player, so to speak.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> And the other Servants might not appreciate someone new horning in on their territory.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> So don&#39;t think they&#39;ll sign off on you that easily just because you&#39;re a famous god of medicine.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> They&#39;re all good people, but they can also be...stubborn.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> If you end up butting heads, I&#39;ll jump in and smooth things over...I hope.</p><hr><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> I see. In that case, it may indeed be worthwhile to have Master come along.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> However, doing one&#39;s part to advance medicine is a duty, not a privilege.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> Anyone who would refuse it is a foolish patient, devoid of imagination, even if they happen to work in medicine themselves.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> So if any of these Servants should ignore my words or Master&#39;s, or otherwise remain uncooperative...</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> ...I will consider them to be interfering with the advance of medicine, and eliminate them accordingly. I trust that&#39;s all right with you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Not really, but we may as well get going anyway.</p><hr><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> Wait. There&#39;s one more important thing I need to ask about. Which Servants have the data?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Oh, whoops, sorry. It was so long ago that I&#39;m kind of fuzzy on who.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> But I do know they were all Servants who&#39;ve used the infirmary themselves, so that narrows it down a lot.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Just let Fujimaru lead the way, and I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be able to track them all down.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Come on then, let&#39;s start looking.</p><hr><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> All right then, lead the way please, Master.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> Though you know, I can&#39;t believe you forgot exactly where you were keeping such crucial data. You should know medical records deserve much more respect than that.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> All that being said, it&#39;s true that I&#39;m still not used to this place, so it would have been difficult to find these other Servants on my own.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> So I suppose that&#39;s one more reason why I should be grateful that you&#39;re accompanying me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I might know this place better than you, but it&#39;s still a big place.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You&#39;re welcome, but we may still have to ask around quite a bit.</p><hr><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> Not a problem. We can start by talking to everyone we come across. I&#39;m used to asking people questions thanks to the many consultations I&#39;ve performed.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> Hmm, here comes someone now. Perfect timing.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> .........</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s Paris. Let&#39;s go say hi!</p><p><strong>Paris:</strong> Oh, hello, Master. Are you taking a walk?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Hold it right there, short stuff.</p><p><strong>Paris:</strong> Heeey... I&#39;m still a growing boy!</p><p><strong>Paris:</strong> Anyway, how are you today, Master? I&#39;m doing great, myself!</p><hr><p><strong>Paris:</strong> And who are... Um...</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> .........</p><p><strong>Paris:</strong> ...Huh? What is it, Lord Apollo? It&#39;s not like you to whisper.</p><p><strong>Paris:</strong> Uh-huh, uh-huh... What? You&#39;re not going to move or say anything here?</p><p><strong>Paris:</strong> You want me to just think of you as a stuffed animal because of reasons?</p><p><strong>Paris:</strong> But why? Does it have anything to do with that man standing there with his mouth agape?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (Oh, right. Apollo and Asclepius have some, um, history, don&#39;t they...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (Did something happen between Apollo and Asclepius at one point?)</p><hr><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> ...That smell. It reeks in here.</p><p><strong>Paris:</strong> N-no it doesn&#39;t! Everyone always compliments me on how much I smell like soap!</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> Oh yes it does. It reeks of Divinity. It reeks of a selfish, narrow-minded, loathsome excuse for a Greek god!</p><p><strong>Paris:</strong> A god...? Are you talking about Lord Apollo?</p><p><strong>Paris:</strong> But he&#39;s so soft, and fluffy, and I always thought he smelled like sunshine...</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> Apollo? Then, that sheep... I knew it.</p><p><strong>Paris:</strong> Ahh! Thief! Lord Apollo thief! Give him baaack!</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> ......</p><p><strong>Apollo:</strong> ......</p><p><strong>Paris:</strong> I can&#39;t believe you just threw Lord Apollo away like a piece of garbage! How could you do such a thing!?</p><p><strong>Paris:</strong> Hmph... Oh no! Lord A-Apollo, your fluffy wool soaked up all that trash like a sponge...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Huh!? Why did you change your outfit!?</p><hr><p><strong>D\uFF1AAsclepius:</strong> Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m not contagious. I just didn&#39;t want to deal with that stink anymore.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AAsclepius:</strong> That...thing is just a terminal. But even so, I don&#39;t want to be in the same room as it, let alone breathe the same air.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AAsclepius:</strong> To be blunt, I hate that thing, and I demand you keep it far away from me.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AAsclepius:</strong> I don&#39;t even want to look at it, as I might end up crushing it unconsciously.</p><p><strong>Paris:</strong> Whaaat? How can you be so mean?</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Oh, I don&#39;t know if you can blame him. Apollo does like humans, but that also means he makes more trouble for them.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Yup, yup. You know that expression about knowing just enough to be dangerous? It&#39;s like, three times worse when you&#39;re talking about a god knowing just enough about humans.</p><p><strong>Paris:</strong> Lady Artemis!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Hi, Paris! Nice to see you too, my poor, grumpy nephew Asclepius.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Heya. I&#39;m the cute Orion. So you&#39;re Asclepius, huh?</p><p><strong>H\uFF1AOrion:</strong> I heard Artemis here went a little wild after I died.</p><p><strong>H\uFF1AOrion:</strong> I might not&#39;ve done anything directly myself, but I&#39;m sorry for the trouble, anyway.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AAsclepius:</strong> ...It was always a dream of mine to fully bring the dead back to life.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AAsclepius:</strong> So I&#39;m sure that cowardly god would have struck me with lightning sooner or later, even without your involvement.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AAsclepius:</strong> The only grudge I hold is towards him and his detestable narrow-mindedness.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Hmm... The gods of Olympus don&#39;t usually go around doing things that aren&#39;t in their spec sheets...</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Well, I do, but I don&#39;t count, since that side of me is fundamentally broken!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Anyway, I overheard Apollo&#39;s name and couldn&#39;t help but poke my nose in. What&#39;re you guys talking about?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AAsclepius:</strong> We weren&#39;t talking. I was just demanding that loathsome terminal be taken somewhere I don&#39;t have to see it.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Gosh, really? Even though Apollo&#39;s just being a cute, harmless, animal-type terminal for once?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> (Then, that means...I can beat him this time!)</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Hmm? So that cute little thing is Apollo? The same god that tricked Artemis and got me killed? I see...</p><p><strong>Apollo:</strong> ......</p><p><strong>Paris:</strong> (Oh, Lord Apollo... You&#39;re going to ride out running into Lady Artemis and Orion by pretending to just be a stuffed animal here, too, aren&#39;t you!?)</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AAsclepius:</strong> Hmph. Never mind that thing. It&#39;s not even close to the main unit.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AAsclepius:</strong> There&#39;s no point in being overly sensitive about a terminal that can&#39;t even talk. It&#39;s just bad for my mental health.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> ...Can&#39;t even talk, huh?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AAsclepius:</strong> That said, it may be a good thing that I happened to run into you here, Aunt Arte\u2013</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Stooop! Don&#39;t you dare call me \u201Caunt\u201D!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> It just sounds so...old! You should know not to call people names when you know it bothers them!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Now come on. We are technically family, so we should try to get along. Isn&#39;t that what humans do with families?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AAsclepius:</strong> Hmph. Family or not, you&#39;re still a god. I have no wish to talk to you more than strictly necessary.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AAsclepius:</strong> You know that just as well as I do. Don&#39;t you, Aunt Ar\u2013</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Stop it!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AAsclepius:</strong> Hehe. Usually, I would be looking for a way to perfect my resurrection elixir, but today, I&#39;m trying to find certain Servants of interest.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AAsclepius:</strong> If you help me, I&#39;ll refrain from calling you the \u201Ca\u201D word.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Gnn. That just sounds like a threat to me...</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> But, okay. Kind big sister Artemis just can&#39;t help but spoil her niblings.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> So, who are you looking for?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Thank you for helping us, O Goddess.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Well, we&#39;re looking for...</p><hr><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Got it. Godly powers, activaaate.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Wow, chintzy much?</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Okay, you&#39;ll find him over there.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AAsclepius:</strong> Understood. Thank you, um... Oh, right. \u201CThank you, sweet and beautiful big sister Artemis.\u201D</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Aww, you remembered what you&#39;re supposed to say when I&#39;ve done you a favor! That was wonderful!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> You think? It sure didn&#39;t sound like his heart was in it to me...</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> This sort of thing is why I just can&#39;t help bestowing my power on you, even when you&#39;re trying to break the rules and make a resurrection elixir.</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> You ever think you&#39;re kind of a pushover when it comes to family? Isn&#39;t that the kind of thing that led to Zeus killing him?</p><p><strong>D\uFF1AAsclepius:</strong> Now that I know where to look, I don&#39;t need to stick around dealing with gods anymore. Let&#39;s go, Master.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> &#39;Kay! See you later!</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> See you, pal! Let&#39;s hang out sometime just the two of us. I got a feeling having you around is really gonna improve my hit-on rate.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> What was that about a hit-on rate, Darling? Are you hitting on other girls again?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Crap!</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Say, Paris, that stuffed sheep of yours looks pretty dirty. Maybe you should throw it in the washer?</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Yeah, I think that would be a great idea, divinely speaking. We could even throw Darling in with him.</p><p><strong>Artemis:</strong> Let&#39;s set the timer dial to \u201CEternity\u201D to make sure his mind stays niiice and clean.</p><p><strong>Paris:</strong> Wait. Huh?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Oh gods, please don&#39;t punish us together! Do you have any idea how awkward that&#39;d be!?</p><p><strong>Orion:</strong> Look! Now you&#39;ve got that innocent little boy all confused &#39;cause he can&#39;t tell if you&#39;re joking!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> They&#39;re certainly a spirited bunch, aren&#39;t they?</p><hr><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> That&#39;s one way to put it. There are far too many Greek Divinities here for my liking. I can only hope this place never gets any more.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> But, that has nothing to do with my work here. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll make sure to do my job well.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> I&#39;ll even treat that little brat to the best of my ability if he should ever come to me for medical assistance.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> I promise you, I won&#39;t go easy on him in the slightest.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> In other words, you don&#39;t discriminate between patients, huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> Of course not. Though naturally, I WILL smash that Apollo terminal into the nearest trash can first. That part is nonnegotiable.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> Anyway, this should be the place...</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> Oh, hello, Master. And you are...?</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> My name&#39;s Asclepius. I need to ask you something.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You see...</p><hr><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> Aha... Now I understand.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> Yes, I do have some of the old exam data pertaining to his records.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> Truth be told, I wondered if I was fit to hold onto it.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> Still, while I may not have had the relationship with him that Master did...</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> ...as one of the \u201Cold guard\u201D here, I did still know him for a fairly long time.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> So since it was only a fragment of the data, I agreed to hold onto it temporarily.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> Answer me this: Are you a doctor?</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> ...No, I can&#39;t say that I am.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> I did work in the infirmary helping him out as needed, but I am not a doctor by any means.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> In the end, I&#39;m just an executioner. I used my hands to end lives much more than I did to save them.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> The only medical knowledge I have came about as a kind of side effect from working in executions. It can&#39;t compare to that of a real doctor.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> Hmph. So you say there&#39;s worthy medical knowledge and not worthy medical knowledge?</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> Medicine is medicine. All that matters is whether it\u2019s useful, and whether it can cure people or not.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> The truth is, the more death you&#39;ve seen, the better you can keep others from dying.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> I&#39;ve seen far more people die than a typical executioner. In fact, that&#39;s what made me want to overcome death.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> ...I see.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> It would seem you truly are the avatar of doctors everywhere, Asclepius, God of Medicine.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> It may not matter how later generations speak of me, but I can&#39;t say I like being called a god.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> In the end, I&#39;m just a doctor who wants to do what he can to develop medicine further. That&#39;s all I need.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> ...So? Will you let me see the old exam data you possess?</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> Let me ask a question of my own first. What do you think, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I hope you&#39;ll let him see it, but it&#39;s up to you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I think you should do whatever you think is right, Sanson.</p><hr><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> I see. In that case...</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> ...there&#39;s one thing I&#39;d like to resolve first.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> If I simply hand this data over now, it would mean giving it up for nothing more than one doctor&#39;s convictions.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> And that&#39;s just not quite enough for something this valuable.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> So I&#39;d like to see your skill for myself, Asclepius.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> Please, show me why you are the right person to take this off my hands.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> Hmm. So you want to see my skill at treating patients and performing operations, do you?</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> Fine with me. But I insist you show me your skill in return.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> No matter how good a doctor you may be, there will always be times when you can&#39;t handle everything on your own.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> If you have what it takes to assist me, you&#39;ll always be welcome in my infirmary!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> Well, well, not bad at all. You really have seen much more death in your time than most.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> You are too kind. Seeing your techniques from the time when gods still walked the Earth was eye-opening.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> There were many aspects to it I couldn&#39;t understand, but I could still tell that it was the result of all the hard work you devoted to truly mastering medicine.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> All right, I&#39;m convinced. I think I can trust you not to misuse this data.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> That said...I&#39;m not entirely sure you&#39;ll be able to understand it.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> ?</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> But never mind that. A promise is a promise. Here you are. It&#39;s all compressed, so it won&#39;t take long at all.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> Hm?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> \u2014. .</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Asclepius?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Are you okay?</p><hr><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> Yes...I&#39;m fine. And this does indeed appear to be part of the exam data I&#39;ve been looking for.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> It also contained information on the man who led Chaldea&#39;s medical division...</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> ...back when it had been completely isolated from the world, and humanity at large, during the Incineration of Humanity incident.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> I also saw what this doctor did back then.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> How he saw patients, how he examined them, how he interacted with them...</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> Albeit only in partial, fragmented form.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So...what did you think? Any impressions?</p><hr><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> About the former head doctor, you mean?</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> Well, in a word... I would say he was a perfectly ordinary man.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> He did all he could handling problems as they arose, and to head them off before they worsened.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> He did his best as a mere human to handle the events happening around him, and to care for the patients they generated.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> That&#39;s not something just anyone can do, and he should be commended for that. Still...</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> ... No, never mind.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> There are all sorts of doctors, after all. It&#39;s not my place to say anything more.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> True, he was definitely a very different kind of doctor than you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Yeah... He was just a regular guy. And a strong doctor.</p><hr><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> I see. At any rate, this data alone won&#39;t be enough to give me the full picture.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> Let&#39;s look for another Servant who&#39;s likely to have a piece.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> Who are you planning to see next?</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> ...I see.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> I can&#39;t be sure about anyone other than myself, but that does sound right to me.</p><p><strong>Sanson:</strong> Unfortunately, I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t know where they could be right now. I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t be of more help.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s okay. We&#39;ll just look around until we find them.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> No problem. Thanks for everything!</p><hr><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> (Although...it seems the last head doctor didn&#39;t care about advancing medicine.)</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> (It was as though he had no interest whatsoever in pushing the medical arts forward, or in helping them to evolve.)</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> (From what I saw, it looked like he had his hands completely full taking care of day-to-day affairs.)</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> (He and I may both be doctors, but our goals are very different. I can&#39;t help but find that disappointing.)</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> (I do still need the old data, but I&#39;ll have to lower my hopes about finding anything else useful for my progress out of it...)</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> There&#39;s a trick to finding this next person.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> This next person always shows up on their own in certain situations.</p><hr><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> Hmm. So that&#39;s why we&#39;ve come here, to where many people gather.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> Be careful. It would be all too easy for infectious disease to spread in such a place, where a number of people are always coming and going.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> On a different note, I was expecting to hear people chattering here, but it&#39;s much noisier than I thought it would be. Some of those voices sound familiar, too.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> ...And then, just when things seemed completely hopeless, I stood my ground firmly and said:</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> \u201CI&#39;ll face you head-on! I won&#39;t run or hide, so just bring it on, you cretins!\u201D</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Right to their faces!</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> I see you still have no idea when to shut up. Stop regaling me with tales of adventure I never asked to hear. It is ruining my meal.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Besides, it was not you doing the fighting in that story. It was Heracles, right? If you are going to tell a story, then tell it right.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Heh. I don&#39;t expect feebleminded felines to understand this, but that&#39;s a storytelling technique called \u201Cplaying up dramatic tension.\u201D</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Hey, you used to teach him as well, correct? Get him to shut up. Or better yet, make him redo his training, starting from year one.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Hahaha, that&#39;s quite the tall order. Though I might just add him to the graduation test for my students.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> So I&#39;d be the great hero standing in your inferior-compared-to-me students&#39; way as the last major obstacle they need to overcome before they can graduate, huh? I could get on board with that.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Good grief. You always were a blowhard, but it seems like you have gotten even worse since you came here.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> ...Hm? That smell...</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> It&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve seen all of you gathered together like this.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> Do any of you have a rare or unprecedented disease to show me to commemorate our reunion? No? Hmph, figures.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> No way! Asclepius! I haven&#39;t seen you since you were serving as the famed ship doctor of my Argo! How&#39;ve you been, you old son of a god!?</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> Still as healthy as ever, unfortunately. I&#39;m sorry to see you doing well too, Jason.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Ah yes, that&#39;s the Asclepius I remember. Hahaha, I&#39;m so glad you&#39;re here!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> He really does look genuinely happy about this...</p><hr><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> (Munch, munch) Do not let him fool you, Master. His joy has nothing to do with seeing an old friend.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Oh, I&#39;m sure that&#39;s part of it. ...At least to some degree.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Excellent! Now my odds of surviving no matter what happens have gone way up!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> You&#39;re one of the Argonauts, after all, so I basically own you.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> And as an Argonaut, it&#39;s your duty to heal me, the captain of the Argo, before healing anyone else, right?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Okay, I&#39;ll go ahead and draw up a contract that declares you my exclusive doctor, just like before.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Naturally, that means you won&#39;t have to bother doling out meds or treating any other patients besides me.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> I have no interest in being your exclusive doctor, Jason. That&#39;s just as true now as it ever was.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> Besides, you&#39;re too damn healthy, anyway. Why can&#39;t you be more reckless and come back with an interesting injury or disease now and then?</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> I&#39;d be happy to take a look at you if you fought a rare Demonic Beast and got a severe injury like Heracles or Theseus&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> ...but the only malady you ever came down with was an upset stomach caused by eating rotten food.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> What did you expect? He is the kind of man who is happy to let others face danger while he hides away in safety.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> What about you, Atalante? You seem much more likely than Jason to provide me with an interesting new case study. Do you have any conditions you&#39;d like me to exam\u2013</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> Hold it. Since when do you have cat ears and a tail? I don&#39;t remember you having those on the Argo.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> Fascinating. Now those are definitely something worth examining...</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Hey! Do not creep up on me like that, especially when I am eating. If you try touching my ears or tail without asking, I will kill you where you stand.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> You may be a great doctor, but you are downright inhuman when it comes to anything not related to medicine. It is long past time you were aware of that.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> I did teach him about things besides medicine, but it seems like they didn&#39;t take. I&#39;m so sorry...</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> Teacher. I didn&#39;t know you were here, too.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> If you ever get any strange or unusual patients, please be sure to send them my way. I won&#39;t be sending any to you, though.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Hehe, you haven&#39;t changed a bit, have you? I&#39;m actually relieved to see that.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> By the way, Master, you should know that Jason is quite serious. Perhaps you&#39;d like to say something?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Great. Now I just have to get a scroll inscribed with a spell of binding for the contract and make him sign\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Hold it. No exclusive doctor contracts while I&#39;m around.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> To sign a contract, you&#39;ll have to run it by me first.</p><hr><p><strong>Jason:</strong> You&#39;re here too, Master? Dammit.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> Even if [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she] wasn&#39;t, I already told you I&#39;m not interested in being your exclusive doctor. Try to listen for once.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> (Oh well, at least he&#39;s aware I&#39;m here now. That&#39;s got to make a big difference, even without a contract.)</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> (No matter how obsessed with medicine he is, he&#39;s still got to feel SOME gratitude towards the man who lead the Argonauts, namely me.)</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> (...Right! Right?)</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> (...On second thought, maybe I&#39;d better just make sure I stick close to him if anything bad goes down...)</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Anyway, Master, I&#39;m sure you didn&#39;t come here just to hold an Argonauts reunion. What do you want?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Well...</p><hr><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Hmm, an infirmary, huh. Personally, I&#39;d rather you open one on my ship before you open one here.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> In fact, now that I think about it, I&#39;m pretty sure he still belongs to me! Where do you get off letting everyone else take advantage of him!?</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Where did you get the idea he was your sole property? Ugh, I swear...</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Do not worry about Jason, Master. Asclepius&#39;s medicinal skills are the genuine article.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> If you can get him to cooperate, and you should, they would benefit everyone at Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> However, his personality is just as horrible as Jason&#39;s, albeit in a very different way.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> There is no telling what sort of trouble he may cause others if it means furthering his medical research.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Hey, you never ate your dessert. Well, that&#39;s just bad manners. Here, I&#39;ll take care of it for you. (Yoink)</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Ahhhhhh!</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> What do you think you are doing!? I was saving that for last, so I could savor it!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Nah, I don&#39;t buy it. You just changed your mind and decided you wanted it after all once you saw me enjoying it.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> But I can&#39;t blame you; it was reaaally good. Mmm, I can still taste its deliciousness lingering on my tongue... Man, I feel real bad for anyone who didn&#39;t get to enjoy that scrumptious treat themself.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> You bastaaard!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Gurk! M-my neck...! Oh crap! This is the same hold you used to beat Peleus, isn&#39;t it!?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> H-help! She&#39;s seriously gonna kill me! Save me, Asclepius!</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> ...Hmm, these injuries are still too ordinary to interest me. I don&#39;t suppose you could twist his neck around a little more...ostentatiously, could you?</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> Ask, and ye shall receive!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1A???:</strong> Hold it right there!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Hey, that&#39;s the person we were looking for.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> There she is! Talk about a happy accident!</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> You there. You are a doctor, are you not? Why aren&#39;t you doing anything to help?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Just look at his face. It&#39;s obvious that cyanosis is starting to set in.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> I don&#39;t know what sort of treatment you&#39;re employing here, but you can&#39;t treat a patient once they&#39;re dead.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> Don&#39;t worry. He&#39;s not going to die.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> I beg to differ!</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> It is all right, Nightingale. His foolishness caused this condition, and death is the only thing that will cure it.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> ...I see. If death is what he needs to be healthy again, then that&#39;s what I&#39;ll have to administer.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> ...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> She&#39;s a Berserker, so...yeah.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Don&#39;t think about it too hard. Trust me.</p><hr><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> All right. I won&#39;t pretend to understand, but it makes sense that medicine would differ across time and regions.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> I&#39;ll need to experience as much of it as I can if I&#39;m to advance medicine as a whole, and the best way to understand it is to try it myself.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> Besides, I can&#39;t back down now. Not when it seems as though she&#39;s also carrying a fragment of the exam data I&#39;m looking for.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> Very well then, we can both demonstrate our technique, using Jason as a test subject.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> ...! (Trying and failing to say \u201CBut I don&#39;t want to be a test subject!\u201D)</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> You&#39;ll help too, right, Teacher? Since you&#39;re here and all.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Well now. I&#39;ve heard of being resourceful, but this is on quite another level.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> You really don&#39;t have any sense of restraint when it comes to anything other than medicine, do you?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> But I don&#39;t mean that in a bad way. If anything, I find it refreshing how unabashedly straightforward you are.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Very well, I&#39;m in. I can&#39;t wait to see how much you&#39;ve grown.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> I&#39;ve said it before, and I&#39;ll say it again.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> As a doctor, you should be more thorough than anyone when it comes to disinfecting. Cutting corners is not acceptable.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> I will do whatever it takes to ensure everything around me is as perfectly sterilized as possible!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> ...Hmph.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> I do not see why we had to hold back that much, seeing how both Nightingale and Asclepius are here.</p><p><strong>Atalante:</strong> We could have easily made him nearly dead instead of just half dead. I will have to do that next time...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Now I see. You weren&#39;t abandoning your medical duties after all.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> By observing his symptoms as they worsened over time, you were able to find a better method to treat his condition, right?</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> I&#39;m glad you understand my methods now, nurse. And I must say, your remarks about sanitization were fascinating, too.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> The concepts of sterilization and nursing may not serve to further the field of medicine, but they do serve to expand it.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> Indeed, taking the entire environment in which patients are treated into consideration, where a doctor is only one part of the whole, may well be the foundation that leads to new advances in medicine.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> After all, one does need a strong foundation in order to avoid tapering off.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> That said...</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> I still don&#39;t understand why your sanitization methods involve guns and fists, let alone throwing beds...</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> But I suspect that&#39;s because I&#39;m an ancient Heroic Spirit, and you&#39;re a very new one.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> I can only hope that my studies here at Chaldea help to remedy that...</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> ...even if the knowledge I gain is limited to the version of me that has been summoned here.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Now, what was it you wished to talk to me about? The old exam data, was it?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Yes, a part of it is in my custody.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> If you wish, Master, and if it will help to improve the infirmary, the last bastion for Chaldea&#39;s patients...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> ...then I am happy to share it with this new doctor, now that I&#39;ve seen how sound his technique is.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong> Here you are.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> \u2014. .</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> ...Hmm.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> (It seems the last head doctor had relationships with many people; much more than his profession alone would cultivate. Frankly speaking, he was well-liked and popular.)</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> (In that sense, it seems like he may have embodied the concepts this nurse was advocating.)</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> (He was acting not just as a doctor but more like the oil that kept everything around him running smoothly. He didn&#39;t just treat individual patients.)</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> (He treated all of Chaldea, Master and Servants alike, as a single organism...)</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> (No... It seems he treated all of humanity, even as it was on the verge of being incinerated.)</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> (That is...quite the accomplish\u2013)</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> (No, not yet. It&#39;s still obvious that he and I have very different stances on medicine.)</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> (He all but abandoned his duty to push medicine forward. That&#39;s the one thing I can&#39;t endorse...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Did it work?</p><hr><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> ...Yes, I got what I wanted. Everything is fine.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> Let&#39;s see... The next Servant I can think of who might use the infirmary...</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> I don&#39;t suppose it&#39;s you, is it, Teacher?</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> No, I&#39;m afraid not.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> I actually came much later than Ms. Nightingale did, so I never met the last head of the infirmary either.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> As such, holding on to records of him is not something I would be comfortable taking responsibility for.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> No, I think there&#39;s someone else out there holding on to that data. Someone better suited to do so than me.</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> In fact...I suspect you may already have some idea of who they might be, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I don&#39;t know. Nobody comes to mind...</p><p><strong>Chiron:</strong> Try to put aside any preconceptions you may have. Once you do, I think you&#39;ll find the answer is really quite simple.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Ah. I wonder if...</p><hr><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> I see you&#39;ve just thought of someone, Master. Go on then, lead the way.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> Whoever they are, I suspect they&#39;ll have the last piece of the data...</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hey hey! Thanks for coming. You guessed it: I&#39;m the last piece of the puzzle.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> I may not have mentioned it before, but I&#39;ve used the infirmary myself, and I also knew the last head doctor.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> For a while, I was even the acting commander. Well, the previous me, anyway.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> Now I see. Why didn&#39;t you tell me earlier? Now you&#39;ve gone and wasted my time.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> See, that&#39;s the thing. I don&#39;t think it was a waste at all.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> This data is... Well, to put it sentimentally, it&#39;s a memento of an old comrade in arms.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> So I didn&#39;t want to just hand it over to you as dull and senseless data. I wanted reading it to be a struggle.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> And it seems my gamble paid off, since you look like you thought about it pretty seriously while you read it.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> ...The only thing I know now that I didn&#39;t before is that the last head doctor and I are very different people.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That&#39;s fine. Hell, as a starting point, it&#39;s more than enough for now.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Anyway, now that you&#39;ve made it this far, I won&#39;t give you the runaround any longer.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Let&#39;s see these legendary medical skills of yours. Skills that staggered Hades and pissed Zeus off.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> My treatment methods aren&#39;t meant for spectacle...but if that&#39;s what you require, then I suppose I have no choice.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> I&#39;ll consider this the procedure I need to perform to cure the malady that is an incomplete infirmary and return it to perfect health.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> Don&#39;t think I&#39;ll go easy on you just because your body is that of a child&#39;s.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> If the circumstances call for it, I have no compunctions about deploying even the most painful treatments!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Yeah, that was impressive all right. I didn&#39;t think you&#39;d know your way around the inner structure of a magecraft device as well as the human body.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> Are you satisfied now?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Hehe, that depends on how you react. By this point, you should be able to tell what&#39;s really necessary.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Even if you collect all the old exam data, it still won&#39;t be enough on its own.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> &#39;Cause if you want to grasp the full breadth of its information, and not just see the raw data alone...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...you need to have a foundation in place that can make sense of it.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> It&#39;s a lot like programming. Just because you can read numerals and English doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;ll be able to make heads or tails of source code unless you know your way around an IDE.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> \u2014. .</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> \u2014. .</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> There, that&#39;s all the data I can give you.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> So...what are you gonna do now?</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> Good question. I think...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> ...I&#39;ll need to start by talking to you two.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> I want to know more about the last doctor. Not just as data, but as a person, from the people who knew him best.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> My pleasure.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You got it.</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> ...Thanks, Asclepius.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Now I can really trust you to carry on his work.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Well, why don&#39;t we put on some tea?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> Oh, we&#39;ll have to get Mash in here, too. She knew him better than anyone, even us.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> ...Phew.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> I see. Now I understand.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> You really had no interest whatsoever in pushing medicine forward. Not even at the beginning.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> The advances you made were only ever secondary. You intentionally excluded everything from your purview except for your own goals.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> The things he did? It&#39;s pretty simple, really.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> He put his whole heart and soul into doing the things he could do and that had to be done, and he didn&#39;t even try to do things he couldn&#39;t and didn&#39;t have to do.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> That&#39;s all there is to it. He knew the limitations of being human better than anyone.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong> He knew that if he reached for more than he needed, he&#39;d end up dropping everything he was holding onto.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> When you have a patient at the brink of death before your very eyes, and you expect their symptoms are going to grow even worse...</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> ...you have no choice but to focus your energies on treating them.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> I see now that those were the circumstances, ever since you came to Chaldea. No...for your whole life.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> Essentially, all of humanity was your patient and it was your job to take preventive measures through symptomatic treatment...against their disease of ruin.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> However, there is still no end to the problems that have yet to be resolved. If we fail to advance now, we&#39;ll eventually be stuck with nowhere to go.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> My predecessor must have known that...so why did he give up on that responsibility right from the start?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...The answer is simple.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> ...I see. I&#39;ve been entrusted to do it for him.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> After talking with Fujimaru and the others, and reviewing all of the data again, I realized that, in one sense, it was a highly committed decision.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> There was a quiet but unshakable spirit in everything he did during his tenure.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I&#39;ll let someone else push things forward. I just don&#39;t have it in me right now.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I want someone who&#39;s up to the task to take it over for me. I&#39;m sure that one day, someone like that will show up.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> After all...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...that&#39;s what life needs if it&#39;s going to make it to the future.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> ...What incredible optimism. No...what incredible conviction.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> I see. So you were absolutely certain that one day, a doctor like me would find their way here.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> That Fujimaru would, miraculously, meet someone like me, and form a connection with them.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> I&#39;m amazed you managed to pull that off.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> Even if the circumstances did leave you no choice, that&#39;s still not the kind of choice just anyone could make, let alone see through to the end...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I finally feel as though I truly understand him.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I used to think he was just an ordinary man...but now, I see what an extraordinarily difficult feat he accomplished.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> He and I may have very different methods, but he still fulfilled his duty as a doctor. Of that, I have no doubt.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> I can&#39;t be your substitute, nor would I want to.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> You and I are very different people, with very different stances. I doubt I&#39;ll be able to carry out all of your wishes in the way you would prefer.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> But, that said...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...I do now understand that he wished to protect this place\u2013this world\u2013even if it meant giving up his entire present and future.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> So, you win.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> I&#39;ll take up the work you left behind, though I will do so in ways I see fit.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> And if nothing else...I promise this infirmary and Chaldea&#39;s medical endeavour shall build upon the foundation you created.</p><p><strong>Asclepius:</strong> So don&#39;t worry about a thing. Rest assured, all is in good hands...Dr. Roman.</p><p></p>',579),a=[r];function i(h,p){return e(),o("div",null,a)}var l=t(s,[["render",i],["__file","Asclepius.html.vue"]]);export{l as default};
