May I speak to you for a moment?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Of course.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Wonderful. That&#39;s just what I like to hear.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Sure, but what&#39;s this about?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Well, as it turns out, it&#39;s about something extremely important. Something that directly concerns me.</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Let me get straight to the point: I have something I wish to confess to you.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Well, that&#39;s rude. There&#39;s no need to look as though you&#39;re bracing for impact.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Unlike a certain dragon princess I could name, I am under no delusions about who you truly are.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> ...Ahem.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> I know I may have been treating you a bit, well, coldly, Master. Not to put too fine a point on it.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Yet despite that, you have been perfectly patient with me and welcomed me with open arms.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Therefore, I feel it is only right that I let my hair down, so to speak, and be my true self around here.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> I know what the others say about me.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> \u201CThe young beauty so cool she&#39;s ice-cold.\u201D \u201CPrim and proper to a fault.\u201D</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> \u201CA porcelain doll who&#39;ll shatter at the slightest touch.\u201D \u201CLovely bangs that half-hide her eyes.\u201D</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Those are just a few of the things I&#39;ve heard myself called.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> But the truth is...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> I am...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> An irredeemable imp.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Bwa?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> I suppose I should be thankful that you seem so befuddled.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> An imp? Really?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Oh? You sound skeptical.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Then again, I suppose I&#39;m usually so elegantly well-behaved that it&#39;s no wonder you find it hard to believe.</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> At any rate, the reason why I went to the trouble of announcing it like this...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> ...is because now that you and I are on better terms, you have an obligation to know who I truly am.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Specifically, I&#39;m going to engage in mischief.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Mischief, huh...?</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Yes. Mischief.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> There is something about making mischief that makes my heart dance with joy. Perhaps it takes me back to my childhood days or something like that.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> At any rate, I can no longer bear to act like the good little girl I&#39;m not, so I will no longer be doing so.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> But I will apologize in advance for the mischief I&#39;m going to cause. I&#39;m sorry, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Got it. But what kind of mischief are we talking about here?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Okay, so exactly what kind of mischief did you have in mind?</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> For that...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> You&#39;ll just have to wait till tomorrow to find out.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Teeheeheehee.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> ...Teeheeheehee.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Okay, time to get up...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...and seize the...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> day!?</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Did I surprise you!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;ll say you did...</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Teeheehee. My first bit of mischief was to change your room around.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Of course, this is nothing the professor et al. haven&#39;t already done, so I&#39;m still only getting started.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Okay, but can I at least change into my uniform first?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Oh my.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Very well then, I&#39;ll just stay right here in the meantime.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> No? I can&#39;t? Too bad...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> But for the record, I&#39;ve had some experience comforting wounded soldiers...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> ...so I have no issue with a man getting changed in front of me. Hehehe.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Of course.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> ...Well? What are you waiting for? The sooner you&#39;re done, the better.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> What, do you need a hand? My, my, I guess I&#39;m not the only princess here, hm?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I guess that&#39;s one way to say good morning...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Indeed. Good morning, Master. Hehe, nothing fazes you, does it?</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Now then, today is our combat simulation day, right? So let&#39;s get going.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Don&#39;t worry, Viy already set everything up.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Mind if I tweak some of those settings first?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Oh my. How could you even suggest such a thing? (Crocodile tears)</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> No, I think we&#39;ll be leaving the settings right where they are, thank you very much.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> And by \u201Cset everything up,\u201D I assume you mean \u201Cmore mischief\u201D?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Why yes.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> We always train in the same boring environments these days...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> ...so we decided to \u201Cmix it up\u201D with some random data from the database.</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Now then, come along. The day&#39;s not getting any younger!</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Oh my, I wonder where we&#39;ll end up first. These random choices are so exciting.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> There&#39;s no possible way this can end well...</p><hr><p><strong>P.A. System:</strong></p><p>Beginning combat simulation in three, two, one...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Let&#39;s see. This looks like...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...So much lava...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> So hot.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> ...I mean, it&#39;s fine. This is fine.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Aren&#39;t you hot in here?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Who, me? Don&#39;t be silly.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> So hot.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> ...What? I didn&#39;t say anything.</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Ahem, ahem.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> I must say, Master, it must be awfully difficult for you, having to prepare for combat in an environment like this.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s okay. I&#39;m used to it.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Teehee, you&#39;re a stubborn one, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> But you know...I actually prefer stubborn people over wishy-washy types.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You can say that again...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Oh, very well then.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> I&#39;ll just have to cool you off a bit myself! And by \u201Ccool you off\u201D I mean freeze you solid!</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> What&#39;s that? Thanks, but you&#39;ll manage? ...Hmph, too bad.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> You&#39;d be surprised how much cooler your whole body will feel with just a mildly frozen nape.</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Anyway, I assume we&#39;ll be attacked shortly, yes? Let&#39;s see, where will the enemies come from...?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Huh? The lava?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Oh my... How did they all survive in there?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Lava... Swimming... Khh, my head!</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Master? Master! What happened? You look white as driven snow!</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> What is it? Cyanosis? Anemia? A migraine?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Well, don&#39;t you worry. I might not look it, but I&#39;ve actually worked as a nurse (or something similar) before!</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> And if I remember my training correctly, you should be fine as long as I keep performing CPR on your heart!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> This is... This is from that Halloween!</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Halloween?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> That&#39;s that festival Chaldea holds in autumn on an irregular basis, right?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Does that mean you last encountered Servants swimming in lava during Halloween?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> ...How does that work?</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Believe me, I wish I knew...</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Ahem, ahem.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> At any rate, I&#39;ll take care of them.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> All you have to do, Master, is ensure I can make full use of my abilities as your Servant. Are we agreed?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> ...So hot...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Well, we DID just fight while surrounded by lava...</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Ugh!</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Whose bright idea was it to set the combat simulator to an environment like this!?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Oh right! It was Viy!</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Well, I&#39;ve learned my lesson. From now on, I&#39;ll pay much closer attention when adjusting the simulator&#39;s settings.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Now come on, let&#39;s get out of here. I can&#39;t stand this heat for a moment longer.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Fine by me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Okay, let&#39;s go ahead and shut the simulator down then.</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Thank you, Master.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> ...Well?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Hang on. It&#39;ll just be a minute.</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Well!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s weird...</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> It&#39;s sooo hooot!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> All that squirming around is just gonna make you hotter!</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Ghhh... But not moving makes the heat worse, too...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> I know. Maybe some light conversation will serve as a distraction.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Let&#39;s see, what to talk about... Say, how much do you know about me, anyway?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> A little something, I&#39;d say...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> I see. Well, I&#39;m happy to hear you&#39;ve done your homework.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> In that case, I&#39;ll skip ahead a bit.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Nada.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Oh my. Well, that won&#39;t do at all.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Every good Master should know at least a little something about their Servants.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Very well then.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> In that case, I will tell you about my background myself.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> ...But I&#39;ll keep it to under five minutes, since it&#39;s so unbearably hot.</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That&#39;s like nothing!</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> What do you expect? I already mentioned the unbearable heat.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Now then. To begin, I was born into the title of Grand Duchess of the Romanov Dynasty...</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> ...And that is how I died.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Oh yes, it was dreadful. Growing up, I never expected I would die in such a cruel manner.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Even now, I will never forget this grudge. If those soldiers&#39; graves were within walking distance, I would march right over there, spit on them, and rub it into the dirt.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> And yet, strangely enough...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Here in Chaldea, it all seems like a far-off, vaguely nostalgic dream.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Does that mean you&#39;d be glad to see humanity die off?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Ulp.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Well, um... Not always, but... Maybe sometimes...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Is that a bad thing?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Good question...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> I would say yes, but there is also a part of me that&#39;s glad for it...because it makes me feel like I&#39;m practically a normal person.</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Hmm...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> I suppose, deep down, I still believe people are fundamentally good.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Not people like those barbaric soldiers, of course, but people like my family.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> ...Which isn&#39;t to say I&#39;m not aware that, historically speaking, my family did some rather dreadful things, too.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> I know they lived, and grew up, and learned, and ate, and lived their lives like any other person would.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Or at least, I thought I did.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> I&#39;m still not sure if our people starving to death was my fault or my father&#39;s fault.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Or perhaps it was entirely Father and the government officials who swore loyalty to him who were to blame.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Maybe the things they did were simply so terrible that my family...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> ...Olga, Tatiana, Maria, and myself...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> ...all deserved to be hacked to pieces and dissolved in sulfuric acid.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I don&#39;t\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> ...(Sigh)</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> I&#39;m sorry. I didn&#39;t mean to bring up such unpleasant memories.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> And besides, I know I will never find answers to those questions, no matter how long I look.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> I just have to keep agonizing over them and looking back on them forever.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> It&#39;s not right for me to expect you to answer them for me, Master.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Oh my, this won&#39;t do at all. If I don&#39;t snap out of it, I&#39;m liable to end up being summoned as an Avenger.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yeah... I&#39;d really prefer if that didn&#39;t happen.</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Is that so? ...Hehe. All right, Master, if you insist.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Let&#39;s see... I believe this is how you make an unbreakable promise in your homeland, yes?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> I swear that I will never become an Avenger. Pinky promise.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> If this turns out to be a lie, then cross my heart and hope to die.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> ...You know, I thought this would be a more lighthearted endeavor. I didn&#39;t realize quite how morbid it was until we got to the end.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Though admittedly, I&#39;m still not sure how crossing one&#39;s heart could actually bring about one&#39;s death.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> And I&#39;m still not sure how one would actuallygo about crossing a heart at all.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Good point.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;d just as soon not find out...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> True. Some mysteries are better left unsolved.</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Oh my, was that an earthquake? ...No, it couldn&#39;t be, could it? Hopefully, it&#39;s a sign that we&#39;ll get to leave soon.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> I suppose this would never have happened in the first place if I hadn&#39;t encouraged Viy to play with the simulator&#39;s settings...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Then again, who&#39;s to say it wouldn&#39;t have?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Oh my. From the look on your face, I take it you don&#39;t believe it could have happened any other way?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Well, say what you will; my Viy is still adorable. Especially his eyes when he has them both wide open.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Though I know some people have complained that he&#39;s scary, or shows up in their nightmares...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> ...or that they&#39;d wish he&#39;d stop glomming on to the backs of their heads.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Me! I&#39;M \u201Csome people\u201D!</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Hehehe, yes, I suppose you are, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Still, you should know that Viy holds you in very high regard, even if he has his own way of showing\u2013</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> It&#39;s freezing.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> If it&#39;s not one thing, it&#39;s another!</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> What is this place? It looks like...a prison made out of ice?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Well I&#39;ve never seen anywhere like this before. Perhaps the system is \u201Cbugging out,\u201D as they say. All right, shall we make our escape?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Sure, but how can we get this cell door open?</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> There we go. Now we can walk right out of here.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> ...Hm? Now why are you looking at me like that? Are you surprised that I would employ such a brutish method?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Well in case you need a reminder, I am the Grand Duchess of the holy Romanov Dynasty. Brute force is absolutely in my wheelhouse.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Now let&#39;s be on our way!</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Oh my...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Now we&#39;re at a party hall? It&#39;s just one surprise after another.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Looks like there&#39;s food for the taking, too...</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Hmm... Well, the flavor is nothing to write home about. And it doesn&#39;t seem to have replenished any of my magical energy.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Then again, perhaps that&#39;s only to be expected, since we are in a simulation and all... I suppose that makes this no different than eating mist.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> And in that case, does that mean I&#39;ve become a wise parsley, able to live off nothing but the faintest drops of dew?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Parsley? ...Ohhh, are you thinking of \u201Csage\u201D?&#39;Cause if so, that kind of sage isn&#39;t a plant.</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> ...I swear, English can be so difficult sometimes.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Why can&#39;t you all keep things simple and just speak Russian like civilized folk!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> From my perspective, I could say the same to you!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Right back at you, only in reverse!</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> ...Fair enough.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> On a different subject, I trust you&#39;re familiar with Jason the hero, yes?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> And you&#39;re also familiar with the series of horror films starring an antagonist by the same name?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Well, can you even imagine our Jason running around with a shaved head and a hockey mask in place of that other Jason?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> I certainly can&#39;t. The very idea of it gives me a huge case of the giggles.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> I&#39;m sure our Jason wouldn&#39;t be very happy to hear that...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> ...but the way I see it, if you can&#39;t be free to imagine whatever you like, then where can you be free?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> ...And on that note, it looks like Viy is doing his best to be considerate.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> What&#39;s that? This is the opposite of being considerate? Yes, you may be right.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Anyway, I suppose this is still a combat simulation, so I won&#39;t feel too bad about crushing them.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Let&#39;s go, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Phew, that&#39;s that. I would say that battle went rather well.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Your orders were absolutely on point, Master. Now then, shall we take our leave of this place?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> ...We CAN leave, can&#39;t we?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;d be a really big deal if we couldn&#39;t.</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Hehe.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Well, if we couldn&#39;t, I suppose we&#39;d just have to throw a never-ending party here.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> ...Yes, that might have been the case. Now that I think about it...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> If we&#39;d been left to our own devices, my family and I might have continued throwing endless parties forever.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> We would have continued to eat, and learn, and grow, without ever growing tired of our day-to-day lives.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> ...All the while oblivious to the people starving to death right beneath our noses.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...I don&#39;t think you can blame yourself for not noticing them.</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> ...I suppose you&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> People can only barely keep up with what&#39;s going on around them.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> They&#39;re just not capable of seriously considering the plights of perfect strangers in the rest of the world.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> If there was an exception to that rule...I guess it&#39;d be the person I&#39;m looking at right now.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> ...I take it from your expression that you have mixed feelings about that statement?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Yes, I know. It&#39;s very difficult to truly be concerned for others during peaceful, ordinary times.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> But in your case, you still wouldn&#39;t hesitate to help anyone in your field of vision, would you?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> I&#39;m sure that way of life will bring you more than your share of headaches, but even so, I hope you never lose that spirit, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;ll do my best.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Good. That&#39;s all I ask.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Because I have every faith that your best will be more than enough.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...All right.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> There&#39;s no need to think too hard about it.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Knowing you, I&#39;m sure all you&#39;ll need to do is follow your heart. You can always rationalize your actions later.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> In your case, I think that&#39;s all you&#39;ll need to be satisfied.</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Now then, let&#39;s get out of here, Master. Tomorrow is another day, after all.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Phew...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Say, Viy? Do you think there&#39;s something wrong with me?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> I might be a Servant now thanks to meeting a creature as strange and mysterious as you...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> ...but do you think I&#39;m really doing the best I can? ...I am, right?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...My chest feels like it&#39;s filled with knives. How can I be sickly, even though I&#39;m a Servant?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>This pain... It&#39;s just like the pain I felt back then, when my family and I were lined up in that basement.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>But, that&#39;s impossible.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Humanity has been restored. Everything should be headed towards a happy, peaceful ending.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...Is that right?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Something doesn&#39;t seem right. It feels like I&#39;ve overlooked something important.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...Who&#39;s there?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Is that me?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Hey, you. What is it you&#39;re doing there?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...No way.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Huh? Am I...sleeping?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Even though I&#39;m a Servant?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong></p><p>...Was this your doing, Viy?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong></p><p>If this is your idea of mischief, it&#39;s not funny. I&#39;m very sensitive, remember?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Or what? Are you telling me...that&#39;s a scene from my future?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong></p><p>... ...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong></p><p>That&#39;s ridiculous. No, that&#39;s not even possible.</p><p><strong>Viy:</strong> \u2014. \u2014.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> ...Nobody&#39;s coming. Maybe this means Master isn&#39;t here.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> ...There&#39;s nobody here.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Um... Who are you?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> !</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Enemies!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...No.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> ...?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> We obey your orders.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Who are... What are you talking about?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> We will kill everyone here, because that is what you want.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> !</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Master! Where are you!? We&#39;re under attack!</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> ...Master? Where are you? Where is everyone...?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Khh... Open your eyes, Viy!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> That&#39;s strange...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> I don&#39;t remember the hallway...being this broken...</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> And...why is there nobody here? ...Master?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Viy:</strong> \u2014. \u2014.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Viy? Do you remember when I was summoned?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> My head... It hurts... No... Stop it, stop it, stop it!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> This isn&#39;t me! It&#39;s not, it&#39;s not, it&#39;s not!!!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> ...Whose side are you on?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I know the answer to that. Or maybe, I only thought I did?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I can&#39;t tell. I think things always feel like some hazy dream.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> It feels as though I&#39;m suffering, then forgetting it all, then suffering, and then the whole thing just...repeats.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...If only I&#39;d never been born.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> It&#39;s with that lament that... I wake up.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What&#39;s wrong, Anastasia?</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Aah! M-Master!?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> I-I&#39;m sorry. I must have fallen asleep.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yup. You were sleeping like a baby.</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> C-come now, Master, don&#39;t tease me like that. I&#39;m supposed to be doing the teasing here, remember?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> I am an imp, after all.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> ...And don&#39;t look at me like that. This is perfectly fair.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...Strange. It feels like...we&#39;ve had this conversation before.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Hey...Master?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> I just had a bad dream. A really, REALLY bad dream.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> So, um... Would you mind holding my hand, Master?</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Would you please hold my hand so that I don&#39;t go crazy or fall to pieces?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Yes... I know. I do.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>I must still be dreaming. I&#39;ve been suffering from my guilt all this time.</p><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> ...Master? I know I&#39;m being a scaredy-cat now, but would you please help me anyway?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Of course!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;m always here for you. Always.</p><hr><p><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Thank you...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Still, I know the truth.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I know there&#39;s still hope. I know tomorrow will always come. I know the future isn&#39;t a lost cause.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> And I know that... because I know someone who taught me that.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Someone strict, and cowardly, and stubborn... Someone utterly adorable who&#39;s probably staring up at the sky even as we speak.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Thank you. I&#39;m grateful to you. So for now, I&#39;m going to get just a little sleep.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> But I&#39;ll never stop waiting for you...because I believe that one day, this hand holding mine will be real.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> You&#39;re the only thing I truly believe in as I while away in this dark, almost frozen time...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Fujimaru.
