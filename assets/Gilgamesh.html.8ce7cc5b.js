A terrible end.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> Based on what I know, if everything had gone the way they should, the ceremony could have accomplished something.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Um. Gilgamesh, do you know about the Greater Grail?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> \u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> S-Sorry... It was impudent of me to even speak, wasn&#39;t it...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> Fear not. You must be the Demi-Servant. Then I shall allow it. However, refer me as your King from now on.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> S-Sure! T-T-Then from now on, I&#39;ll call you by King of Heroes!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Oh my. The scary King of the Uruks has taken a liking to our Mash.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Think he&#39;s got his reasons?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> Mage. No, I see that you refer to yourself as a Doctor, then Physician is what I shall call you.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> Physician from the future. What are you people, this Chaldea?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> I speak not only of the Demi-Servant. The young one there is far too inexperienced.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> An incomplete warrior and a barely competent Master.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> Do you truly believe a pairing like that can secure the future of humanity?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> That&#39;s harsh. It was a tough decision for me, too. Right, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> There are no other Masters.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I must fight even if I&#39;m not competent.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senp... no, Master is right. I understand that you disapprove of us.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But there&#39;s no one else left at Chaldea who can fight.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We have no choice but to mature through this battle, O King of Heroes.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> So you fight because you must... If you put it that way, then I can&#39;t question such determination any further.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> Humans are creatures that only develop their talents for the sake of the benefits they gain.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> Fujimaru. Mash. Ascertain to the utmost what your benefits are in this battle.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> But first, you must guarantee my benefits. Otherwise, we will be enemies.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> E-Enemy!? S-S-Senpai, what do you think benefits the King of Heroes?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Treasure? It&#39;s treasure, isn&#39;t it? But we don&#39;t have any treasure that could satisfy him!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yeah, more like we want treasure!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Help us, Doctor!</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> Don&#39;t lose your composure. I expect no treasure from you. What I seek from you is, THAT.</p><p><strong>Monster:</strong> FUUUUuuuuuuu\u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Shadow Servants! We&#39;re surrounded, Master!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> The souls of the dead came at my call. Fujimaru. I shall use them to test your worth.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> I expect victory, though it need not be overwhelming. I seek an entertaining victory.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Oh, he just wants to test his Master. No need to hold back, then.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Fujimaru, Mash! Show that King what you can do!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Of course, don&#39;t forget to also give the King of Heroes your orders. You are his Master right now, after all.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> S-Sure!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Of course, lots of orders!</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> That Physician always seeks the last word. It must be hard having him as your boss, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> But, he speaks the truth. No matter how inexperienced, you are the [\u2642 man /\u2640\uFE0F woman} I contracted with.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> Fear me, respect me, and fulfill your duty as the one who contracted with me!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> I suppose that will do. How does it feel to survive what could have been a Holy Grail War?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That was a Holy Grail War?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That was really something...</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> Excellent. I was slightly entertained. Your struggles were quite an enjoyment.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> Know that this is what benefits me. For now, at least.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Hmm... so the King of Heroes dislikes humans?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Fujimaru is one thing, but you&#39;re saying humanity isn&#39;t worth protecting?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> Are you a fool? There is no like or dislike. Humans simply have no value.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> All of you, remember this. Humans have no value. Their creations, however, are worth something.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> I love one thing: results. Think well on this, and never forget it.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...I see. So that&#39;s the kind of king he is. This Servant&#39;s going to be a handful.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> But he&#39;s certainly powerful. You can count on him to the end.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Although it&#39;ll be tough, so good luck, Fujimaru. I&#39;m trusting you to take care of the King of Heroes.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> O-Okay...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;m not sure if I can do it...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> G-Good luck, Senpai! I&#39;m not much, but I have your back!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou, fou.</p><h2 id="law-of-creation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#law-of-creation" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Law of Creation</h2><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> \u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (The King... He seems angry and irritated... He&#39;s in the worst mood possible, Senpai!)</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Kyu... Kuu, fouuuuu...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> (First the Massive Cavern, now Angrboda... Maybe he has some attachment towards the Grail?)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Maybe it&#39;s just a whim?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...Maybe he likes to feel like a Last Boss?</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> I can hear you, Chaldea trio. Your imprudence and optimism can even feel refreshing.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> I am not observing the remains of the Greater Grail, but rather the disposition of the one who made it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The one who made the Greater Grail...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Back in Angrboda, it was \u201CM\u201D... a mage named Makiri Zolgen. Do you mean him?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> Fool. The likes of Makiri cannot create cauldrons of magic. This is\u2014 No, I shall remain silent for now.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> All the clairvoyants other than myself are keeping their mouths shut.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> If I say anything here, all their efforts will be for naught, yes?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Wow! Who knew the King of Heroes was capable of showing consideration for other people!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> ...Hmmmm. However, who do you mean by the other \u201Cclairvoyants\u201D?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> \u2014Perhaps the most famous would be him, that half-incubus mage...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> Merlin, the Mage of Flowers. If what I have heard about his powers is true, he could also see the obsession burned into this Greater Grail.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Obsession? You mean there&#39;s a curse placed on this Magical Reactor Core?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> Indeed. As proof, look. The souls of those who have failed to die have gathered.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master, look out! I&#39;ve detected hostiles from within the fog!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Looks like the ghosts that were seared onto this land. Fujimaru, you should be able to handle them now.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> You&#39;re in the presence of the King of Heroes. You have my permission to go crazy to impress him!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> The dead never learn. They&#39;re like moths to a flame\u2014Hmm?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Be careful! I&#39;m picking up a large amount of magical energy! Is the core still active!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;m seeing an A-Rank Servant heading for you! Fujimaru, Mash, be careful!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> I see it&#39;s not only humans that retain their attachment to the world of the living even in death.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> These are the remnants of a dream. The dying screams of those who dreamed of progress and a brighter world.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> Very well. You are worthy of my judgment. Fujimaru, prepare yourself.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> Just like the physician said, if you can defeat him, I&#39;ll give you a reward.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> So you defeated it. After fighting it, I found it to be nothing more than a boring monster.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> Hatred cannot dwell in a silent machine. That was the obsession of the fool who made the Greater Grail.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> O King of Heroes, what do you mean?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> The hatred of the enemy that Chaldea seeks, the one who seeks to incinerate the history of man.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> I have little interest in the battle this time around. I don&#39;t care who&#39;s the mastermind.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> However\u2014 This I shall say. Fujimaru, what you&#39;re chasing is an avatar of hatred.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> Of course, there are different types of hatred.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> Hatred born of righteousness, or love. Hatred born of jealousy, or anger.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> This hatred is\u2014 Yes, it is a most \u201Cfoolish\u201D hatred.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A foolish hatred? Generally speaking, hatred is not good for anyone.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But from a broader perspective, there is neither \u201Cgood hatred\u201D nor \u201Cbad hatred.\u201D In that case, my King, what makes you call it foolish?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> Idiot. Look at what&#39;s around you. Nothing is born, nothing is achieved... The ultimate form of idleness.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> If this isn&#39;t foolish, what is!? Nothing here is saved!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> Listen, Mash. May it be evil or foolish, all actions result in benefit.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> But this kind of hatred exists as well: the hatred of a fool obsessed with leaving nothing behind.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> ...It matters not. Someday you shall face this thing.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> And when you do, remember what it is you fought to protect.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> The problem with this king is that he occasionally says things that seem significant.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Well, we should keep his words in mind, with a grain of salt that is. Okay, let&#39;s head back, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It seems like the King&#39;s in a better mood.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...Hold on, we forgot something...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...Um, where&#39;s my reward?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, that&#39;s right. The King promised a reward.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> He said if we beat this monster he&#39;d reward us!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> Fool. Would I ever break a promise? The reward has been granted already.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> One way or another, you&#39;ll understand during the next battle. Boorish fool, don&#39;t make me explain everything to you.</p><h2 id="law-of-heaven" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#law-of-heaven" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Law of Heaven</h2><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> I hear there are dragons on this island. Naturally, we shall go on a hunting trip. Now prepare yourselves, mongrels.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> O-Of course. But my King, some regions revere dragons as gods, so wouldn&#39;t we be cursed or suffer divine punishment for troubling what could be a local deity?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It won&#39;t work, Mash. Saying that kind of stuff will only get him more pumped up.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Those are insignificant for my king.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> Hmph, it seems Fujimaru is starting to understand.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> Indeed, those who would dare cower themselves before the gods shall be punished my hands.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Alright! Time for a good hunt!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> Indeed it is! Fine reply, Fujimaru! It seems your heart is starting to understand the joys of battle!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This is not good, Doctor. Senpai and the Golden King are suddenly on the same wavelength!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Yeah. Talk about unexpected.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s because Fujimaru can get along with everyone, or Gilgamesh is just more reasonable than we believed.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Either way, both of them are in perfect sync. Even if it&#39;s just a momentary miracle!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> Hah hah hah. I only came here to while away the time, but it actually looks like things are starting to get entertaining! Fujimaru, prepare yourself for a grand adventure!</p><p><strong>Monster:</strong> GuyyyyyyyoooOOOOO!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> And of course there would be a monster waiting! Senpai, this is starting to feel like a stereotypical pattern!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> Foolish girl, we are going to hunt down dragons! Then it is only natural to encounter monsters in a forest...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> ...or perhaps monsters in a cave, or even more powerful monsters in the depth of that cave!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> And that is what makes any adventure a tale worth telling for! Do not be mistaken about that!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We finally made it through the forest, and now we&#39;re facing a labyrinth? ...Master, I&#39;m sure you understand by now...</p><p><strong>Monster:</strong> ...Mah.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> Interesting, golems constructed using the language of dragons is quite a rare sight. It seems there is a knowledgable one amongst the dragons fallen here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Those are powerful golems standing in our way. We have no choice but to defeat them. Right, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Mash... Are you mad?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> C&#39;mon, let&#39;s enjoy this, okay?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I don&#39;t have time for that! I shouldn&#39;t worry because both Senpai and the King are by my side, but fighting golems made by dragons is scary!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Dragon:</strong> Welcome, and how are you today? This is my magical workshop, Vortak&#39;s Dragonbones.</p><p><strong>Dragon:</strong> An underground labyrinth was slated to undergo construction to lure some unlucky humans in so I can slaughter them and take their money but...</p><p><strong>Dragon:</strong> ...We&#39;re actually still a month away from our grand opening, but your timing couldn&#39;t be more perfect: I was just looking for some helpers.</p><p><strong>Dragon:</strong> Therefore, as much as I want to let you go, I guess I can&#39;t really do that. Especially now you found out about my grand plan.</p><p><strong>Dragon:</strong> Get roasted by my breath and succumb to your fate. I&#39;d like you well-done and working a 60-hour week as my bone-cushion.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I didn&#39;t have my hopes up, but this is just terrible.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> If King Gilgamesh is invovled, either we get something really scary or really weird!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> Hahahaha, your praise is music to my ears, Mash! But even I am at a loss for words!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> I came searching for a dragon so I may test my Master&#39;s worth, but to think I would find such an idiot here!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> Fujimaru, accept this as your fate. Minds that think alike attracts each other.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> It seems your lot in life is to have idiots as your worthy opponents.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I don&#39;t think that statement applies to me...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I know. I&#39;m like a weirdo magnet.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I hate to interrupt when you&#39;re having fun. Despite that dragon&#39;s behavior, that thing there is the real deal!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> It has more magical energy than an A-rank Servant! It might be even more powerful than Fafnir!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No way! It looks like it has such a dreadful brain though!</p><p><strong>Dragon:</strong> My brain is not dreadful. My thoughts are dreadful. Nay, evil!</p><p><strong>Dragon:</strong> It costs you nothing to enter, but everything to leave! I&#39;ll suck your bones dry and throw you away like a pile of trash!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Dragon:</strong> Guaaaaaaarrrrrgghhhh! To be defeated even before my grand opening...</p><p><strong>Dragon:</strong> It can&#39;t be... Are you the Counter Force that will eliminate any threat to the world before it occurs\u2013The Seventh Guardian!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...The battle is over... Who knew that idiot of a dragon would be so powerful... It really was the worst...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Whoa... Not only that, this guy is dirt poor!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Dragons are generally known for hoarding treasure, but this one&#39;s lair is as empty as its skull!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> There&#39;s nothing good about this dragon!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> Is that true!? I cannot believe my eyes... His treasury is completely empty...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> It must have wasted everything on trying to build its labyrinth...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> Couldn&#39;t even scrounge up some treasure to leave at the finish line, the worthless fool...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Well, our goal here was never this labyrinth to begin with...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s right. My King, you said earlier you wanted to test Senpai&#39;s worth...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Is that just you being considerate? So that Senpai can be acknowledged as a proper Master?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> Fool, do not utter such nonsense.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> A proper Master? The day this [\u2642 boy /\u2640\uFE0F girl} becomes a proper Master, this world shall no doubt be saved already.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> I simply came here to sharpen the edge of my treasured sword, Ea. I was sure Ea would end up in a good mood if it faced a dragon.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> However... Hm... Fujimaru, you have done well for a mongrel.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> Our enemy was the worst this time, but I shall find you worthy prey next time.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> Accept that as the proof of your own growth. You have become a mage worthy of hunting the most exquisite prey.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You&#39;re right.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Thank you for your gracious words, O King of Heroes.</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong> Hmph, it was but a trivial matter. No need to thank me. Now then, it&#39;s time to go; I have no more use for this miserable place.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> My King, wait! ...He went on ahead. Was he trying to hide his own embarrassment?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I don&#39;t think so. He might just be bored of us. Ultimately, that man has no concept of embarrassment or sympathy.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Either way, there&#39;s no doubt he has acknowledged us.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I was a little nervous and unsure of what&#39;s going to happen when he formed a contract with us...
