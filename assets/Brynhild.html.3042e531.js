Are you awake, my dear Sigurd?</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> Ah, you&#39;re finally awake. Good morning. Morning has arrived even upon Hindarfjall.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> The sun is shining, the little birds are chirping at one another... such a wonderful morning...but not really.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> I am certain that the doom of Chaldea will be here. The world will burn to ashes.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> Yet still, you stand to face it. For the ceaseless tomorrows, for the ever-coming tomorrows.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> ...Good morning. I shall be accompanying you for a very short while.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> My name, let me see...Companion... Valkyrie...No...no. Now, though, yes.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> \u2014Call me Mash.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1A???:</strong> You see, as I am now, call me Mash. My adorable, shining, and fleeting Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Huh? But you are...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Ah, yes. Now I remember. It seems you have some degree of resistance.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Then I have no choice but to do this. I&#39;m sorry. To be honest, I want you to be just the way you are.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I&#39;m...sorry.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I don&#39;t know your real name, but I do know...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, you&#39;re right... Even though this is the end of time, you...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...You have not shown weakness in your mind. Even now, you can think of others...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A beautiful heart. A strong heart. I believe that was once what I loved.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I&#39;m sorry, now...for just a short while, I will touch your lips. With these fingertips.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s all right. There is no need to worry... Yield to the rune.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...There. It&#39;s finished.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> How do you like it? You know my name, my hero, my Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Mash.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;m pretty sure it was Mash.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Yes, Master. My adorable Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> All right\u2014let&#39;s Rayshift together again today. My hero. To save the world.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...There is still some left. The Demonic Fog, that is.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The way things are... There are still traces from the Fourth Era that are yet to be repaired.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Demonic Fog. Life-stealing death mists that are packed with magical energy. Like the atmosphere during the Age of the Gods.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> If it&#39;s the end of the 19th century AD... The atmosphere should be close to that of 20th century Tokyo...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> However, you might call this a tragedy... As this is the last island left with ancient mystics...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Industrial...revolution... ...The people who brought about the evolution of civilization...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I can&#39;t believe these people will be slain in this way. What a cruel, ironic punishment.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Are you all right, Mash?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You&#39;re looking awfully pale.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ah...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> \u2014Ahh\u2014</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m sorry for causing you this trouble\u2014 Apparently I was affected by the Demonic Fog. I...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I can&#39;t believe... I allowed myself to be so shamefully overcome...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> To be caught in one&#39;s arms... by a human child...by you...I&#39;m sorry...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ohh... Dear, me...Your...your...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Your...hand. It is so warm...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But Sigurd&#39;s hands had been so cold... but now, you&#39;re...so warm...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> \u2014Wait! I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;ll step back. When we touch each other too much, it rattles me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;m so flustered... Your warmth makes the flame inside me grow strong.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Before my flames burn you to ashes, allow me to test you. Allow me to learn what kind of person you are.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Your flames will burn me to ashes?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> How are you going to test that</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...You&#39;ll see... soon enough.</p><hr><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You heard that, right? It reached you, right? That is the destiny which you must face.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Someone is fighting within the Demonic Fog!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It sounds like a Helter Skelter!</p><hr><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong> Oh! How beautiful! Such a lovely Valkyrie!</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong> Rejoice, my brawny Berserker friend, help tantamount to an army has come to assist!</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> You idiot! That is a maiden of Heorot. Her beauty is questionable. Getting involved with her is trouble.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> Hey! It&#39;s not as if I&#39;m going to die here, nor do I have any business in your manor.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> So don&#39;t you wander up to us like tha... I see, so you&#39;ve already been stopped by a mistletoe.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> Then I guess you&#39;re of no harm to us... Whoa!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Two Heroic Spirits?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> They are fighting the machines?</p><hr><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> Why yes, I&#39;ll crush the enemies I see before me. That&#39;s all I am doing here.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong> Hahaha! Whatever the era, wherever the location, there is only one road for the honorable Knights of Fianna!</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong> Namely, the path of righteousness! Destroy evil! Protect humans! Honor first shines upon those that shepherd in eternal peace!</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong> I hold no grudges. No, never! I am a man of endless generosity!</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong> When the isle of Britain is Erin&#39;s, there too I shall equally display righteousness.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong> Ahh\u2014How logical and bright! What&#39;s more, this unrivaled, handsome young man is at his peak! What could be better!?</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong> When a person is shining, he must shine to his fullest. Wouldn&#39;t you agree there, Berserker?</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> It seems our interests are similar but completely different in nature. However, it&#39;s true that we are both greedy in our desires.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong> Precisely! We speak of what we want, and we mercilessly pummel enemies that get in the way! It&#39;s what heroes are made of!</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong> I don&#39;t get along with you in the least, but it seems to me that we are essentially of the same breed.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong> This seems to be a rare place where our paths have crossed. Hahahahaha! This is an excellent omen!</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> You said it. As long as we have the power to crush our enemies, then it&#39;s all good.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> \u2014Hey! You there, Master, and your companion.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Companion\u2014 He called me a companion... That person seems like a very good Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> What did you come here for? If you&#39;re wandering through these mists, then you&#39;re certainly not a pitiful citizen of London.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> Let me ask you again, what have you come here for?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I take back my previous statement... That was the question I wanted to ask, horrible beast.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I have a question for you as well, ageless, fleeting, and shining one. Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What is it you are doing, as we continue to Rayshift, today, tomorrow, and forever?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> \u2014Fight.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Someday save the world.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I don&#39;t know...what to say.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You are too radiant and glorious... When I gaze upon you shining so brightly...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I...in this very moment have decided... even though I am here...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> \u2014No, no! To battle, Fujimaru. You will achieve victory. Because I am at your side.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Even if we didn&#39;t have the protection of god, even if we didn&#39;t have the protection of this world...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I, for this time alone, will grant you the protection of a great Valkyrie warrior\u2014</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> \u2014What a ridiculous fight. If I&#39;m gonna get in a punching match it should be with a Servant.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong> You mean several, right? The more powerful the enemies are, the more joy there is in defeating them, and the greater the profit.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> Profit? Who needs that? It&#39;s unnecessary. Do you take money from a woman after sex?</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong> Just forget it. There&#39;ll be no more killing here. Farewell, nameless Master.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong> Well, well. He was a formidable warrior to the very end. True, he was strong, but I&#39;m sure he would&#39;ve run out of enemies to defeat.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong> It goes to show that I need not have worried.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong> In fact, you resemble my own subordinates. You&#39;ve made me feel a little parental affection, or should I say, kingly affection.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong> \u2014Yes. Now let me address the lovely lady over here!</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong> In this fight with the speechless iron knights and dolls, you displayed magnificent heroism.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong> Therefore, a romance with this battle maiden seem inevitable... If I had the time, I would certainly go through with it, but...</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong> It seems this materialization is but a temporary one, I am destined to return to my former battlefield.</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong> What a pity. When it comes right down to it, I am too impatient to remain here any longer...</p><p><strong>Fionn mac Cumhaill:</strong> Yes, I must end the boredom here! Farewell, young Master! Away!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Alas...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I don&#39;t know...what to do...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Humans leave only destruction in their wake, yet even in these times, you, my hero, resist.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You can stand side-by-side with the dragon slayer Beowulf. You can fight alongside the god slayer Fionn mac Cumhaill.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> When I see you like that, I... I...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> \u2014I really don&#39;t know what to do.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Why don&#39;t you know what to do?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> When you are so heroic... I can&#39;t help...but to...love you...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I love, I love, I love you. I love, I love, I love, I love you...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I end up...loving you...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;m not sure what to say</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I-I&#39;m...sorry... ...I really will...be more careful.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I will be more careful...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...But, ohh... No, no. You make me so flustered, that, ohh...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> All I can do is show you who I am. Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> My true name is Brynhild. Yes, that is the truth. I am not Mash Kyrielight.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Huh? What the... Really?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> As I thought, you aren&#39;t Mash.</p><hr><p><strong>A\uFF1ABrynhild:</strong> ...Yes.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ABrynhild:</strong> I was the Valkyrie, the machine, who assisted the great god Odin of northern Europe, yet was transformed into a human woman and met my death. That is I.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ABrynhild:</strong> Please forgive me. Due to who I was in life, I cannot help but see into your soul...</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ABrynhild:</strong> Therefore, I have come to a decision. My father, Odin... I cannot be your daughter...</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ABrynhild:</strong> I will be a woman carved into human history, I will be a hero&#39;s companion.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ABrynhild:</strong> ...Alas, these cries are from the Demons. This is the final summoning of the last vestiges of the Demonic Fog.</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ABrynhild:</strong> They may have even been guided to us by the damnable blue flame. Either way...</p><p><strong>A\uFF1ABrynhild:</strong> ...How dare they...interrupt...what I want to say!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> \u2014Ahh, I killed it.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> The vile enemy that stood between us is dead. It&#39;s all over now.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> How unfortunate... But, yes, this may be for the best.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> If I remain with you any longer, I would surely... be in greater and greater trouble...</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> ...Therefore, let us part for now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Will we meet again?</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> Yes, yes. Until that day...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> We&#39;ll meet again.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> ...That&#39;s right. Someday, when the stars align and our paths cross...</p><hr><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> Take care, and stay healthy, my fleeting and fragile, but strong and stout, beloved human child.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> I&#39;m sure that when we meet again, I&#39;ll be of assistance.</p><p><strong>Brynhild:</strong> \u2014Farewell.
