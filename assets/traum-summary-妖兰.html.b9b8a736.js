Living, dying, standing, sitting, thinking, feeling, wishing, praying. None of that. Neither pain, nor joy. No sense of unease, nor relief. Only the foreboding knowledge of the end. To die without meaning in a place like this. But, something within was prolonging my life just a little. So I ask, until the end... as what a human should be. Not through prayer, but singing. This is, the only thing, that \u25A0 can do, right now.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> (\u25A0\u25A0\u25A0\u25A0 it,\u25A0\u25A0\u25A0)</p><p>(Red lights flash, and the darkness becomes a dark fog)</p><p>Soliloquy. Ahh, that&#39;s right. I probably am a traitor, for betraying Pan-Human History, and all sincerity. This is probably due to my incompetence, or should I call it, competence?</p><p>My sin, my karma, my duty. The day when all that ends will finally come, under the waterfall called Reichenbach.</p><hr><p>(Scene ends, then shifts to the Storm Border Bridge)</p><p>Sion begins her briefing on the large-scale singularity. The time period is shaky, but somewhere before 1700 CE at the minimum deviation of at least 100 years. Location is unidentifiable, but based on analyzing the plant distribution, the Far East, Africa, or Europe are ruled out, leaving America. Mana output isn&#39;t as thick as the Age of Gods, but observed values of disturbances report extremely high levels continuously rippling like a pond where rain falls. Sion wonders if someone&#39;s haphazardly firing off Anti-Army Noble Phantasms over there.</p><p>The other factor is the Human Foundation Value being ERROR, something that has never occurred before and not associated with EX rank. Da Vinci explains that the smallest mini-singularity would be classified as an E- rank with no need to rank others below it, but the singularity in question cannot be classified as a singularity in the first place. Gordolf wonders if it&#39;s some sort of bug, but whatever it is, it&#39;s something with no answer. Only way to find out is to go there.</p><p>Sion now introduces the rayshift compatible candidates for this mission: Sherlock Holmes.</p><p><strong>Guda:</strong> &quot;Nice to have you, Baritsu!&quot;</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> &quot;Hahaha, is that a greeting?&quot;</p><p>Since Ortenaus is still undergoing maintenance due to extended use in the Fairyland and Tunguska, Mashu is unable to participate. It doesn&#39;t look like Fou would go either, but the next candidate is announced: Vlad III.</p><p>Only three candidates are eligible for rayshifting. Mashu cannot rayshift, so Holmes was selected. Vlad was chosen after some...not-so violent methods were used when consulting the other applicable servants. Vlad III reassures Guda and dematerializes until needed.</p><p>With Holmes and Vlad chosen, Sion announces one more candidate, a special guest who will also be rayshifting...</p><p><strong>Guda:</strong> &quot;One more...?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> &quot;That&#39;s right. With two Masters, we can cover more ground.&quot;</p><p><strong>Mashu:</strong> &quot;Sion! you don&#39;t mean...!&quot;</p><p>A wild Kadoc appears.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/H9zVksg.png" alt=""></p><p>Note: Fun fact - The classic main menu theme plays when Kadoc is re-introduced</p><p>Kadoc is a Crypter, but his Lostbelt is destroyed, and his refuge called Olympus is no more. The only option he had was to surrender. Of course it would be hard for Chaldea to believe him, but Kadoc will prove his worth with his actions.</p><p><strong>Guda:</strong> &quot;And that collar?&quot;</p><p>(Kadoc opens his coat and reveals said collar)</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> &quot;You&#39;re sharp. Sion, explain.&quot;</p><p>The collar is a mage-killer device developed by Atlas Academy. If Kadoc were to do anything suspicious, attempt to remove the device, or use unauthorized magecraft, the collar will trigger and destroy all of his magic circuits, killing him. Of course this annoys Kadoc since he&#39;s essentially nerfed, but Guda welcomes him to the party. Of course being the senior, Kadoc tells Guda that a magus should not be careless with info and must always watch their Command Seals. Da Vinci points out that Guda, although they do have master aptitude, isn&#39;t really a magus, and so requests Kadoc to teach them.</p><p>In the back, Holmes whispers to Sion regarding Kadoc&#39;s Siriuslight:</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> &quot;He can&#39;t release it. Put it on hold for now.&quot;</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> &quot;Understood. If the Foreign God could remotely activate the Siriuslight, then she would had done so. It&#39;s not good to be caught off-guard.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sion:</strong> &quot;You&#39;re right. I&#39;ll pull the trigger if that Siriuslight, let alone a Command Seal, were to go off.&quot;</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> &quot;Best not to go that option if possible.&quot;</p><p>Onto the last explanation. There are some keywords regarding the singularity that were extracted by HIEROGLYPH: No problems. Revolt. Two Eyelids.</p><p>Guda is confused, and so is Sion. What she thinks of these words are two points: &quot;That you cannot escape from this singularity&quot;, &quot;That it is on the same level as the seven singularities&quot;. Da Vinci thinks that this singularity will impede their progress to the seventh Lostbelt and thus recommends its destruction. Guda begins their rayshift.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/dirVagd.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>--SECTION BREAK--</strong></p><p>In any time, place, and idea, nothing is more difficult to succeed than in war.</p><p>Die, die, die, die.</p><p>There is nothing but careless death.

For something&#39;s sake, she prayed. For anyone&#39;s sake, she prayed. That is the correct course, for this is how she proves herself through devotion.</p><p>However, this prayer was aimed towards herself. To make her sins not her sins, her atonement not her atonement. And yet, the contradiction is that only the fruits of her devotion are laid here. This contradiction is what drives her into an uncontrollable suffering.</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;I ask of you, to save me.&quot;</p><p>She was puzzled by a wish that she didn&#39;t know who to direct it towards.</p><p>(The man walks in)</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;I apologize for being late.&quot;</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;No, it is fine. I&#39;ve just started praying.&quot; &quot;......&quot;</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;It&#39;s nothing. Now, to continue, let us pray for your sake.&quot;</p><p>No matter how much blood is on his hands, may we shoulder a little of that sin. I&#39;m sorry, sorry, sorry.

Caster&#39;s analysis is that the battle between the two realms is in a stalemate.&quot;</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> &quot;Mmm, the skirmishes have stopped. As I thought, they&#39;re still very cautious of us. What about you, Roland?&quot;</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong> &quot;...Isn&#39;t it obvious? We may have the smallest force, but our soldiers and officers are by no means inferior. Put your all into it and you&#39;ll definitely reap the rewards.&quot;</p><p><strong>Class\u30FBSaber:</strong> &quot;And most of all, this realm is where our great king, Karl the Great, resides.&quot;</p><p><strong>Class\u30FBLancer:</strong> &quot;Ooo! What can the likes of Kriemhild or Constantine do anyways!</p><p><strong>Class\u30FBArcher:</strong> &quot;There is no true king other than Karl the Great!&quot;</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> &quot;And that&#39;s what I&#39;m told, Great One-sama!&quot;</p><p>(Scene shifts to a silhouette of an king-like figure... who looks rather small)</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/bcEmAmM.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;Uh huh.&quot;</p><p>(A female silhouette with animal ears also appears)</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;That revenge-driven queen and that emperor who failed to protect his country, they are no enemies to us. Thus speaks Karl the Great.&quot;</p><p><strong>Class\u30FBSaber:</strong> &quot;Ooo, well said!&quot;</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;Uh huh.&quot;</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;We should always move last, for a king must not act rashly. Assassins, keep up your efforts. Everyone, work hard on your training. These are the King&#39;s words.</p><p><strong>Class\u30FBArcher:</strong> &quot;Yes, understood!&quot;</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/0iuo20B.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> &quot;Great One, Roland or I are ready for the next task.&quot;</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;Ah.&quot;</p><p>(The female whispers to the king)</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;I leave it to thee, Roland.&quot;</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong> &quot;It is an honor, my lord. Well, I&#39;m off now!&quot;</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> &quot;Rolaaaand. Did you forget your sanity again?&quot;</p><p><strong>Roland:</strong> &quot;I&#39;m not you so of course I won&#39;t forget!&quot;</p><p>(Roland leaves, leaving Astolfo and the king and the woman remaining in the chambers)</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> &quot;Ahem. So, how did it go?&quot;</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;We managed to make it through another day. Haah, what a sigh of relief. You also did your best, Danna(2)-sama.&quot;</p><p>(2) TL Note: Master</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;But all I said were &#39;Uh huh&#39; and &#39;Ah&#39;!&quot;</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;That&#39;s fine. Sometimes a hundred words isn&#39;t any better than a single foolish one. To be honest, it&#39;s not good to talk, otherwise you&#39;ll go bal... it&#39;ll peel off your aura (kingly valor).&quot;</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;Hey, was that an indescribable insult directed towards my top-head?&quot;</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> &quot;You&#39;re being pa-ra-no-id!&quot;</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;Is that so...&quot;</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;Well, leaving that aside, the scouts have been bickering a lot lately. As I thought, we can&#39;t hold onto this deception forever. The famous Karl the Great not showing up at all... being injured in some way, or occupied with more important matters. It&#39;s only natural to think like that.&quot;</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;But, if I am to go out like a bang...&quot;</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;It is the quick and easy way to go.&quot;</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> &quot;Hahaha, you must be in trouble!&quot;</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;This isn&#39;t a laughing matter.&quot;</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> &quot;Eh, really? In short, all you need is an event that doesn&#39;t raise suspicions on your King guise? Like say, something like a fourth force is coming?&quot;</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;...!&quot;</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> &quot;It&#39;s just my instincts acting in some way or another. The tides are about to turn, so let&#39;s prepare as many scouts and take advantage of this opportunity!&quot;</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;If that&#39;s your intuition, then it sounds trustworthy enough... Very well, I will send the scouts out. It won&#39;t be just Assassins but also Riders and Casters as well. I will leave the defenses to the other classes. They can hold the area to some degree. I also wish you the best of luck.&quot;</p><p><strong>Astolfo:</strong> &quot;Rooooger!&quot;</p><p>(Astolfo leaves.)</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/bcEmAmM.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;Danna-sama.&quot;</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;Uh huh.&quot;</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;I feel that you stand at a crossroads here. Please stay strong.&quot;</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;Ah, of course. Let us show them the power of Don... Karl the Great!&quot;</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;You&#39;re already trending on thin ice with those words, Danna-sama. If we get caught, we&#39;ll be done for.&quot;</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;Eeek.&quot;</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;I ask of you to be meek, but also bold. Is that clear?&quot;</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;Uh huh!&quot;</p><p><strong>???:</strong> &quot;Now then... the fourth force would obviously be that organization, right...? I wonder will happen next.&quot;</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ycMurIP.png" alt=""></p><p>The scene then switches to the rayshift, but something has gone wrong, as if the rayshift itself is glitching. Nonetheless, Guda, Kadoc, Holmes, and Vlad III successfully land at a grassy area, but the rayshit question still remains. Communications with Chaldea are still retained via Mashu, and she also noticed the anomaly. Fortunately, Mashu confirms that everyone has safely arrived without any further issue.</p><p>The group prepares to heads north, with Holmes acting as the rearguard while the Masters are in the middle. Suspicious noise is heard at first, but Holmes dismisses it and the group moves on.</p><p>Clear skies. The pleasant sound of the warm wind over the meadows. Everything is quiet. Peaceful. And that is why I cannot help but feel a frightening sense of foreboding approaching. It wasn&#39;t Guda, Kadoc, Vlad III, or Holmes who felt this premonition, but...</p><p>Back at the Storm Border, Da Vinci remains silent.</p><p>Still, it was only this girl who compelled them to investigate this singularity...</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/nOtn9Oq.png" alt=""></p><p>The group reaches the village, only to find it destroyed. Vlad does not sense the presence of anyone in the village. Holmes requests Kadoc to analyze the ruins, which the latter agrees to despite it not being his specialty. While Kadoc gets to work, Holmes speculates that the rubble, and by extension the destroyed village, was the result of not human activity, but one of magecraft nature.</p><p>Kadoc concludes that the entire area has been woven by magecraft, akin to a Caster&#39;s Territory Creation. An ordinary magus would have difficulty accomplishing this task, so a servant is likely the culprit. Holmes finds it strange that the town&#39;s architecture is from a time period between medieval and early modern Europe. He likens the situation to a picture set, where if there were faint traces of human activity, that activity would had taken some time to accomplish, whereas someone like a servant could do this in an instant.</p><p><strong>Vlad III raises his thoughts:</strong> If the town was created not by a servant, but by someone close to that level, then who could had destroyed it? Holmes believes that it couldn&#39;t be a natural disaster, and there&#39;s no evidence of an animal rampage. Traces of arrow holes, swordfights, and wheel tracks indicate that there was a fight between servants.</p><p>As soon as Holmes says that, Mashu detects servant signatures and tells everyone to be on guard. She counts their numbers... only to be shocked and call Da Vinci to confirm if there was a mistake or something. Da Vinci tells Guda that an army of one hundred is attacking, all of them being servants. Everyone is shocked and Holmes asks for a re-confirmation, to which Da Vincis confirms that they are all servants and orders everyone to retreat and hide.</p><p>Mashu later notices another army of servants of similar number approaching. This town will soon become a battleground between the two servant armies, and there is no time to negotiate between either, so the best course of action is to hide. However, since Guda and Kadoc aren&#39;t servants, hiding their presence would be difficult, and staying as a group would quickly rat them out, so Holmes suggests that the Masters find a different place to hide while he and Vlad will find a different way to get through this ordeal. Vlad tells Guda to use a Command Seal if the situation worsens. Holmes wishes the Masters good luck as he goes to gather information on the servants.</p><p>Guda and Kadoc find a good hiding spot and dig a hole to hide in. Kadoc then uses a camouflage magecraft to hide their presence. Although he&#39;s unsure if it&#39;ll work against servants, it&#39;s better than nothing.</p><p><strong>Guda:</strong> &quot;That&#39;s amazing...&quot;</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> &quot;What do you mean amazing? This is just elementary magecraft.&quot;</p><p>Guda expresses interest in learning Magecraft from Kadoc, but Kadoc dismisses it saying that his magecraft is now outdated. The magecraft in question is anti-beast magecraft, designed strictly against beast foes. In ancient times, humanity had to fight not only themselves but also wild beasts capable of defeating ordinary humans, so anti-beast magecraft was created. In the modern era where wild beasts are no longer a commonplace, this magecraft has become obsolete.</p><p><strong>Guda:</strong> &quot;Have you thought about quitting magecraft altogether?&quot;</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/pV6LXXp.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> &quot;...&quot; &quot;...&quot;</p><p>&quot;You caught me off with that question, but no. Now, let me tell you this. Any honest to proper magus would kill you for asking that question. Anyone would be offended if you told them &#39;Your life&#39;s worthless, so why don&#39;t you die?&#39;&quot;</p><p><strong>Guda:</strong> &quot;I&#39;m sorry...&quot;</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> &quot;Well, it&#39;s not like I can do anything about it thanks to this collar... sorry, that was just a snide remark. I guess I&#39;m bad at situations like this...&quot;</p><p>The armies are getting closer, so Kadoc cuts the idle talk. All Guda and Kadoc can do is pray that they don&#39;t get caught.</p><p>A Vengeance Realm (Red) Saber reads off a report from scouts: They will be facing a mid-size enemy force. Vengeance&#39;s strategy is to have Archers fire off a simultaneous volley of Noble Phantasms while their Riders cover the ground. The Sabers and Lancers will then push through the middle and attack at the same time the Riders disorient the enemy. Their success depends on the timing of their Noble Phantasms.</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> &quot;Unbelieveable... they really are all servants...&quot;</p><p><strong>Guda:</strong> &quot;Their true names...&quot;</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> &quot;We don&#39;t know, but they all come from different time periods and nationalities, and yet they&#39;re all one army... I can&#39;t believe it. Just what in the world is this singularity...? In the first place, even the Holy Grail has a limit to how many servants it can summon. Are they... stray servants?&quot;</p><p><strong>Guda:</strong> &quot;Are they a type without a Master?&quot;</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> &quot;Yeah. You ran into a few of them in Singularities and Lostbelts. Exceptional servants tied to the land and the Holy Grail and summoned by them. This would be the case with Beowulf in the Russian Lostbelt. But, this amount of servants is abnormal. Taking the other side into account, there are two hundred servants here. We might be wiped out alongside this village...</p><p><strong>Guda:</strong> &quot;So even this area is unsafe...&quot;</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> &quot;We were supposed to escape from this soon-to-be battlefield, but at least they aren&#39;t coming to look for us. Well, let&#39;s see what happens next.</p><p><strong>Guda:</strong> &quot;Aren&#39;t you getting a little desperate?&quot;</p><p><strong>Kadoc:</strong> &quot;I&#39;m... not... I&#39;ll reflect on that.&quot;</p><p>The battle begins. Red Saber orders the Archer group forward. The Restoration (Blue) Realm Berserkers usher a warcry, leading Sabers, Lancers, and Riders into battle.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XpDMvJu.png" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/u1RtfqY.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>Class\u30FBSaber:</strong> &quot;Wait for it...&quot;</p><p><strong>Class\u30FBArcher:</strong> &quot;...&quot;</p><p><strong>Class\u30FBSaber:</strong> &quot;Fire!
