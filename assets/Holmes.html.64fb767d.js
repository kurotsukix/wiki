Hmm, let&#39;s see...simply think of what you are about to witness as memories from the shadows of the future.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> ...or a dream, if you like. Though, lamentably, I am unable to intervene in dreams.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Which is to say: this is not a dream.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Now then. Let us begin.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Have you ever read the most excellent and famous detective mysteries that feature Sherlock Holmes as their main character?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Each features the detective solving various mysteries, set in the 19th and 20th centuries.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> The stories are frequently adapted to film and other media. Surely you have at least heard of them.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> ...And so, seeing me manifest here as Holmes, one imagines you wondering:</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> \u201CWas Sherlock Holmes an actual individual? Wasn&#39;t he a man of fiction?\u201D</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Indeed. Curious. Very curious.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Am I the manifestation of the character in the stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Or did the great detective Holmes really exist, and were the stories based on the events of his life?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> ...In other words, were the stories written by Sir Conan Doyle adapted from the biography by Watson?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> This must be a great puzzle to you all as well. I had meant to bring this up one of these days.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> This time around, the story is not about the Incineration of Humanity, nor its restoration.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> The story is about yours truly.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Good morning, Senpai. Did you get a good night&#39;s rest?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Morning, Mash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, hello.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I rested well. Thanks.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It appears Mister Holmes has something to discuss with us this morning. Something about the battle simulator for training...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Good morning, Fujimaru. You have arrived at precisely the moment I anticipated.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> As Miss Kyrielight mentioned, I would like you to accompany me to the simulator for an experiment.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> The item I requested from Sir Babbage has finally been completed. I would like you to try it out.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> An item, you say?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> An explanation would be a simple thing, but it would be far better to experience it.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> It&#39;s not Rayshifting per se, so there&#39;s no need to be nervous. I would, however, advise you not to let your guard down.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Some battle is to be expected, of course. Let us begin.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um, excuse me, Mister Holmes! Senpai hasn&#39;t finished changing into the proper Mystic Code...!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Yes, I have already accounted for that and made the necessary adjustments. This is not a standard Rayshift, so it is easy enough for me to control such minor details.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Now, let us begin. Begin simulation!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai. Senpai, can you hear me?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Good, we&#39;re connected. I&#39;m glad. This feels more like a Rayshift than a simulation.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So where...exactly is this place?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Did the simulator always have a stage like this?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> This seems familiar... Or maybe not so much...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Well, it doesn&#39;t ring a bell to me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Normally, the simulator creates stages based on locations we&#39;ve visited in Rayshifts.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But, this is...wireframe...?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> To use the parlance of science fiction, you might call it cyberspace. In that it is virtual reality, it&#39;s not much different from the simulator...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> But behold! Thanks to the program that Sir Babbage created, we are inside Chaldea&#39;s computer system!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So in the end, it&#39;s cyberspace.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Inside the computer system!? Does that mean you two are digitized?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Correct. Though, only our consciousnesses in this case. The technology necessary to digitize the physical body has still yet to be created.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> This place really does seem familiar...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Allow me to explain. The Simulator you normally use to train contained a curious mass of data within the mainframe&#39;s internal memory.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I lent my aid to the staff in an effort to remove it...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> But it has given us quite a fight. And so, I requested the mathematical genius Sir Babbage to help us out.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um, wouldn&#39;t it have been easier for Babbage to work on it himself...?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I wanted to see for myself. Certain aspects of the venture tickled my fancy.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> So I asked Sir Babbage to do the impossible task of creating a program to hack in.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I see?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Do you understand now?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> So what&#39;s the point of me and Mash being here?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Ah, solving mysteries... While I certainly derive a certain satisfaction from solving them myself without anyone ever knowing...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I had the opportunity to invite you along and took it so that I might provide a bit of commentary while I went about solving this mystery.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> And I simply could not do that were I alone, now, could I?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So...because you wanted to comment on it... Well, it is true that when a great detective solves a mystery, an audience is an absolute necessity!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We have front row seats to Mr. Holmes&#39;s commentary, Senpai!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yay!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That&#39;s cool and all, but it&#39;s REALLY early...</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Indeed. And there is also the possibility of battle. I am not entirely certain that my new Spirit Origin can handle it alone.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A new Spirit Origin?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Mister Holmes...didn&#39;t you mention that you manifested as a Caster?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Well, you&#39;ll soon see.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Now then. Let&#39;s proceed, shall we? The node with the data mass in question is ahead.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I would have liked to appear immediately in front of the data mass, but the target node is well-protected.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Protection?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> So it&#39;s the usual you-know-what...?</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> An all-too-familiar howl!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I knew it!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Senpai, I&#39;m detecting an enemy!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Huh? But you&#39;re inside Chaldea&#39;s mainframe...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You&#39;re in a computer...and yet I\u2019m detecting a response from an enemy that actually has magical energy!?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Ah, as expected.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Mister Holmes!?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> While we are indeed in the simulator, I should warn you that the battle we now face will be more real than a simulation.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Any injuries you sustain will likely affect your physical body in reality. Proceed with caution.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> We&#39;ll be fine.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Yep. Saw this coming.</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Ah, that is certainly reassuring. Let us hold nothing back.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Target approaching rapidly! Please be careful, Senpai!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Battle has ended. I&#39;m not detecting any other enemies in your vicinity.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Good work, Senpai. ...Senpai?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Holmes...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...Bare-knuckle boxing?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Now that you mention it...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Mister Holmes did use a special...facade in previous battles, saying there was an issue with his Spirit Origin.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But this time...his appearance didn&#39;t change during battle!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> And he fought with his bare hands! Could that possibly be the famed, mysterious martial arts style...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...that Mister Holmes utilized...taken directly from the stories of Sir Conan Doyle!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Baritsu!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Baritsu!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What kind of martial art is that!?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I haven&#39;t used Baritsu for a long time, but it is quite a thrill. Hm? What&#39;s the matter, Miss Kyrielight?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> And with you, Master? As my Master, shouldn&#39;t Baritsu be familiar to you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Um, I don&#39;t know Baritsu.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Wait, what? \u201CMaster\u201D!?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Ah yes, I suppose I neglected to mention that.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I have officially become a Servant of Chaldea, and formed a contract with you. I did so last night.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> We already had a connection, so it was only a matter of time... The rest... Well, a variety of circumstances and changes have taken place.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Wait a minute, your Class...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I-is the label of Ruler a typo...?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Ah, yes. I mentioned I was a Caster. Forgive me. I lied.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> !!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A...lie...? M-Mister Holmes...that&#39;s...um...well...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> A jest. My apologies. I couldn&#39;t help myself. Allow me to explain in all seriousness.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> When I officially became a Servant of Chaldea, my Spirit Origin changed...significantly, much to my surprise, as I am sure you can imagine.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I was, most assuredly, a Caster before. But as of now, I am Sherlock Holmes, Ruler.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You turned into a Ruler!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> So that wasn&#39;t a typo!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Ruler, Sherlock Holmes!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I see, so that&#39;s how it is!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Since he is a great detective who has solved many difficult cases, it may indeed be appropriate to call Holmes a peacemaker or a mediator.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No, I should not even say \u201Cmay\u201D in this case! I should say instead that this was very likely to happen!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> In the past, Jeanne, Martha, and Amakusa Shirou all told me the following:</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> In the case of Heroic Spirit summoning based on the Holy Grail, only actual saints could be summoned as Rulers...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But Chaldea&#39;s summoning system is not bound by such rules.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Curious. Very curious. A detective ought to seek the truth and lay it bare.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> To make a ruling should be the job of a judge or a jury. My goodness...</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> By the way...there&#39;s something that&#39;s been bothering me...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> What is it?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The man who was Sherlock Holmes, the world&#39;s greatest detective and one and only consulting detective...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> May I ask a question? This has been on my mind for the longest time...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Mister Sherlock Holmes, which exactly...are you?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> By \u201Cwhich,\u201D you mean...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Um...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I believe you, Mister Holmes, know exactly what I am asking you.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Indeed. But as it happens, I would like you to say the words this time. Actually, it need not come from Miss Kyrielight herself...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Master. You have the same question in mind, correct?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Did you really exist, historically I mean?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Are you only a fictional character?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That&#39;s it! That was what I was curious about...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> At first, when I met you, all I could think was, \u201CThe great detective really did exist!\u201D And I simply accepted that fact.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Thinking about it, though... I&#39;m not really sure. I&#39;ve never heard the truth from you, Mister Holmes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> On top of that, I recall you making contradictory statements about whether or not you are fictional...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Ah, I see.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I anticipated that this question would come up one day, and so I cannot say I am surprised. It is, after all, a perfectly reasonable question.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> But Miss Kyrielight. Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> If you do ask outright, things may grow more complicated. Would you mind that?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Hm...?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Greek mythological heroes such as Heracles and the witch Medea... Karna and Arjuna from Indian mythology...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Celtic heroes, the knights from the Legend of King Arthur, Charlemagne&#39;s famous paladins, the giant-killing Beowulf...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> The four retainers of Raikou who slayed the demon spider Tsuchigumo... Many myths and legends spoke of these heroes and great men and women...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Let us say for the moment that I am indeed a creation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. What, then, is to say that the individuals I mentioned are not similar creations?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I was created during the time when Doyle wrote his stories, but many heroes of legend were created by people writing stories long after their respective moments in time.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> For example, Siegfried&#39;s story found in the Poetic Edda, while set in the 5th century, was not completed until after the 8th century.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Karna and Arjuna&#39;s story is set somewhere around 5000 B.C. The text itself, however, was completed sometime between the 4th century B.C. and the 4th century A.D.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Even the legend of Sakata Kintoki, Mister Golden himself, was said to be set down in narrative form sometime after the Edo period.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Other than him, the majority of the heroic tales of Japan&#39;s Heian period were passed on in stories told during the early days of the Edo period.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So these heroes existed long ago...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...Their legends were told long after they lived.</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Ah, indeed. That is probably true. So what of me?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Oh, I get it.</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Ah, you understand now?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> What difference is there between these heroes of legend and myself? None. We are essentially the same.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> But there isn&#39;t proof that you really existed...</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Proof? Hm, I see. So you&#39;re saying that there&#39;s no physical evidence throughout human history that proves my existence...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> There are indeed no official documents or records of my tenancy of 221B Baker Street.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> ...Or rather, records say there is no such place.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Are you trying to say...that it actually exists?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> That may simplify matters for me, but allow me to digress for a moment.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Consider the other heroes other than myself.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Hardly any heroes of myth have been proven to exist from the standpoints of cultural anthropology or archaeology. No remains have ever been found.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Even places said to be the burial sites of the heroes of legend have provided no proof.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> One exception would be the Trojan War. Schliemann made the glorious, wonderful discovery that the Trojan War was actual historical fact.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Before his great discovery, the poems of the \u201CIliad\u201D were believed to be no more than legend.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> The same goes for the other heroes. Many of them are fictional\u2013characters of legend.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> As such, many other Heroic Spirits also lack any definitive proof of their factual existence...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Indeed. To believe myself alone to be a fictitious being would be folly.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Legends and similarly unverified tales are no more than stories humans tell, correct?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> The world is spherical, not flat. It is not carried upon the shoulders of the great titan Atlas, as Greek myth would have it.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> The night is a result of the Earth&#39;s rotation, not of the goddess Nyx&#39;s cave.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> There is no record of the evil dragon Fafnir existing in the 5th century, and even the Legend of King Arthur was woven by Sir Malory.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> In other words, this world is...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I...see...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Hm? I feel like we got off track...?</p><hr><p><strong>B\uFF1A???:</strong> Ugh! You talk too much!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Oooooooooo010100001111...! 1011100101, I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s real or fictitious!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Who said that!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> That&#39;s one seriously digitized shout!</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I suppose it&#39;s time. In the midst of all that prattling, we&#39;ve reached our destination.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The unidentified data mass...! So that voice we heard\u2013</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Well, it is not unidentified.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Eh? Um, but...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I can see why you might believe that. But think back...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Allow me to explain. The simulator you normally use to train contained a curious mass of data within the mainframe&#39;s internal memory.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I lent my aid to the staff in an effort to remove it...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Ah!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> He didn&#39;t say \u201Cunidentified!\u201D</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> A curious data mass... E-excuse me... I just said \u201Cunidentified\u201D because what you said made me assume...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Holmes should have worded it better.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Holmes...you malicious man.</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Haha, my apologies. It&#39;s true. There&#39;s no need for Miss Kyrielight to regret her words.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> It was easier to guide you all here by inferring that we were going to investigate an unknown entity.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Of course, I have already deduced the identity of the data mass, and now that we are closer, my belief is becoming a growing conviction.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> In other words...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> It is excess data that has been piling up in the memory of the battle simulator&#39;s mainframe.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> It is generated every time Fujimaru wins.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Normally it would be deleted every time training ends, but it appears some fragments have remained in the registry.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Excess data...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Generates every time we win?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Yes. It&#39;s anger that is generated every time NPCs lose a battle.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Anger...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> NPCs...the enemy sprites we fight in simulation battles?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> As they were created to simulate the enemies found in the Singularities, the NPCs are very aggressive.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> NPCs are obviously not artificial beings. That is to say that they have neither emotions nor personality. Yet, they still have some measure of intellect.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> At least where matters of battle are concerned. They are equipped with AI so that they can think in battle.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> They are created expressly for you to battle.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Werewolf, Goblin, Wyvern, Hermit Crab, Demonic Boar...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> And a variety of Shadow Servants have also been created. It appears that these numerous NPCs felt anger each time they lost.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Their anger...secretly building up all this time.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That seems to be contradictory.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> ...Anger? But they don&#39;t have emotion, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Precisely. \u201CAnger\u201D is not exactly the right word, and it should not even be possible in the first place.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> They were programmed to win, and yet could not... NPCs should only be capable of acknowledgement of that fact.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> But someone twisted that acknowledgement into the emotion of anger. And that is our culprit.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Well, I will personally deal with the culprit later on...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> For the time being, we must pacify the NPCs our culprit has driven berserk in order to keep the simulator operating smoothly.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> (W-wow, Holmes is amazing! He&#39;s talking like this case is already closed!)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I wonder who the true culprit is...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Okay, first let&#39;s quell their anger!</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong> Ooooooooo0101010101...!!!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Getting defeated continuously within the data sphere...regret!!! I&#39;ll make sure nobody will be able to use the battle simulator ever again!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Using us for every little thing...! Die, Chaldea! Die, Servants! Die, Master!!!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> We will never drop Ascension materials for you again! EVER! Why would real materials drop in a simulator, anyway!?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> To hell with Embers! To hell with Secret Gems!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Ooooooooo0100111100110101! Die! Die! Die and become excess data, too!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Magical energy response is increasing, Senpai! Prepare for battle!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I shall leave the commands in this battle to you, Master. By the way, the Mystic Code best compatible with me would be\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Enemy response approaching... They&#39;re coming!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Egad!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Battle has ended. I am not detecting any traces of magical energy around you anymore, either.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Good work, Fujimaru. The case is closed for now.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> This shouldn&#39;t damage the simulator&#39;s operation, and the NPCs should no longer harbor anger.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Never forget, Master: those beings battle you endlessly, day and night, so you might train and grow.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Though they will no longer possess anger or feelings of regret...</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Even if they are no more than data with neither personality nor life... They are in a sense members of Chaldea who helped in your fight to save humanity.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> It may be best to keep that in the back of your mind whenever you go through a Battle Simulation.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Mister Holmes...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> He sure summed that up pretty nicely...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> So, what exactly are you, Holmes?</p><hr><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Hahahaha.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Returning to that topic would once more open up a can of worms. If that is all right...</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> ...I see you&#39;ve glossed over it all.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Child of Hydra, dragon&#39;s skin and fang, talons of the Tsuchigumo spider of the East, relics and Noble Phantasms left from the Age of Gods...</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Even behind the shadows of society, if we speak of the realm of magecraft, there should be plenty of \u201Cproof\u201D you can present.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Historical? Fictional? Why on earth would you be mentioning this now?</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I had no choice. If we had dug deeper, we would need to discuss matters such as parallel worlds or the Pruning Theoretical Phenomenon, and I would even need to go into detail about the Age of Gods.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> We live in a world where the distant past retains no physical trace of us... That is the manner of uncertainty in which we live.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> It is as it should be, since what we can see and touch and experience as reality are brief, fleeting events.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Even secured by the Sacred Lance, such a thing could easily be stripped away if the means were discovered.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> There&#39;s no need for humans to know. They shouldn&#39;t know.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> That is why I was given the Spirit Origin of a Ruler...as a mediator and judge.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I mediate the truth and rule over all creation to maintain the history of humanity.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> As one who shines a light on the truth, I sense that the world is telling me that not all illusions and dreams should be laid bare.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> That&#39;s utter sophistry. You could very well have avoided any or all of those topics while explaining, great detective that you are.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> It&#39;s quite vexing to hear you flatter me. Do stop that at once.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Hahaha! Your words cut deep!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> And well they should.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Ah, one more thing: That tampering with the battle simulator was your doing, yes?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Mmm? Whatever are you talking about?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> I confess I was interested in the device, from a mathematical standpoint, you see. And I did take a look at the system itself. No more than that, though.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Let&#39;s have your story, then. I noticed an inexplicable burst of static lasting only a few seconds during Chaldea&#39;s log this past May.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Even I could not determine quite what it was. It must have been a special case indeed.</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> I have at least a notion of what manner of phenomenon it was. You must have used THAT static blocker as a reference.</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> If you knew from the beginning, then I&#39;d appreciate you refrain from even asking! Honestly, you&#39;ve always been such a pernicious detective!</p><p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Oh? Has there ever been any instance where I showed my wicked side to you within Sir Doyle&#39;s works?</p><p><strong>Archer of Shinjuku:</strong> Wh-why, you...!</p>',357),a=[n];function i(h,l){return t(),o("div",null,a)}var p=e(r,[["render",i],["__file","Holmes.html.vue"]]);export{p as default};
