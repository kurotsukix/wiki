I&#39;m a hidden eyes kind of guy too.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> I see.</p><p><strong>Bartholomew:</strong> Guess this means the day&#39;s finally come for you to lower your bangs as well, huh?</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Hahaha. By the way, on a completely different subject...</p><p><strong>Bartholomew:</strong> (Damn, he&#39;s a slippery one.)</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>8:00 a.m.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>By this point, the more diligent Servants are already hard at work, whether that entails research, training, investigating, or any number of other fields.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Our subject has chosen a simulator training regimen as though it were the most natural thing in the world.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> His opponent...</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong> I shall be your opponent today.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> You have my thanks, Lord Yagyu. Now then...have at you!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Okay, I think that&#39;s enough for today. Forgive me for cutting the proceedings short.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> I simply fear that if we go any further, I too may end up treating this like a genuine duel.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong> ...I see.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong> If I may, Prince of Lan Ling, your swordplay strikes me as similar to sword dancing.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong> It retains all the grace and suppleness of dance...</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong> ...without sacrificing the sword&#39;s weight or cutting edge.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Haha, that&#39;s very kind of you, but my style is nothing to boast about. It&#39;s something I had to devise on my own.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> As a general, I was so busy studying politics and warfare that I only had time to learn the bare minimum of martial arts.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> All the techniques I use now were moves I developed on the battlefield. I turned out to be much more adept at dodging than defense, so that&#39;s what I tended to focus on.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong> I see. So your sword dancing was forged in the heat of battle.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Your swordplay, on the other hand, was breathtakingly refined, Lord Yagyu. I learned a great deal from this sparring session.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong> My Otomeryu is not ordinarily meant to be seen by outside eyes...</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong> But that was a concern for my living self. Now that I am a Servant\u2013a shadow sworn to serve a new Master\u2013it is no longer relevant.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> I see. Now that humanity itself is in crisis, we can&#39;t be choosy about how we fight back.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong> Be that as it may, I am afraid I cannot allow myself to copy your style.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong> My son, Mitsuyoshi, would have no compunctions about claiming any technique he liked as his own, but no matter.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Does that mean your son has a different style than you, Lord Yagyu?</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong> Oh yes, very different. His talent with the blade came to him naturally, and his technique can only be described as flawless.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong> Nonetheless, the world is a big place. There is surely someone somewhere strong enough to rend steel with their bare hands.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Ah yes, like the ones descended from living, breathing gods.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Good point. Then I suppose we will just have to train hard enough to keep up with them.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong> Indeed.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Oh, it looks like the next group is here. I&#39;d best be on my way then.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong> Very well. Until the next time.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong> Hmm. It seems he noticed my warrior&#39;s instincts getting the best of me. What a pity.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong> Now then, you there.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Urk.</p><p><strong>Yagyu Tajima-no-kami:</strong> What have you been doing this whole time?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>After being called out by the nonsubject male, I decided to make a swift and quiet getaway.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> 12:00 p.m. Lunchtime.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> However, the subject heads to the underground library rather than the cafeteria.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Oh, just for the record...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> I&#39;d like you all to know that the library&#39;s name was recently changed to:</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...\u201CThe Great and Terrible Yet Beautiful Murasaki Shikibu Library\u201D I&#39;ve heard so much about!</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Oh, hello, Prince of Lan Ling. What sort of book are you looking for today?</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Good question...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Well, we did just get in a few grimoires and valuable antique books thanks to a certain, um, anonymous donor...</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> I see.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> (Despite getting new books, she seems rather preoccupied...)</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> I&#39;m afraid we have yet to receive the new shipment of military strategy books I&#39;ve been expecting...</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Oh, I know. What about a book that Master would like?</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> I could bring it with me the next time I visit [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her].</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Oh, what a lovely idea.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Okay then, wait here, please.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Um, let&#39;s see... I think it was above this shelf...</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Uh-oh.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Aah!</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Forgive me. This was the only way I could think to help in the short time I had to act.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> O-o-oh gosh, I&#39;m so terribly sorry!</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Not at all. The important thing is that you&#39;re okay.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> O-oh, yes, I&#39;m fine. Besides, it&#39;s all my fault for not being more careful...</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Accidents happen to the best of us. Please, pay it no mind.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> So, is this the book you were looking for?</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Y-yes, that&#39;s it.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Then I&#39;ll go ahead and check it out straight away. Thank you for your help.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> My pleasure.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...And so our subject makes a graceful exit, apologizing for his intrusion in touching Murasaki Shikibu&#39;s body even as his gentle smile makes it clear he meant no harm.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> (Sigh)...</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> That may well be the most beautiful man I&#39;ve ever met, in multiple senses of the word.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> Even with the mask on, he had my heart pounding. I shudder to think of what may have happened had he not been wearing it.</p><p><strong>Murasaki Shikibu:</strong> ...H-hang on. I think I might be able to use this feeling in a story! I&#39;ll go write it down in my idea notebook right now.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> 4:00 p.m.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The subject strikes up a conversation with two passersby.</p><p><strong>Paris:</strong> I see... So that&#39;s why you wear that mask.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Man, it&#39;s a good thing you weren&#39;t born in Greece.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Back there, good looks like that would either get you cursed or blessed, and there&#39;d be hell to pay either way.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> I can understand the downside of being cursed... but wouldn&#39;t a blessing be a good thing?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Hardly. Sure, a blessing might mean you&#39;d be living the good life for a while, but one wrong word and bam, the gods go divine retribution on your ass.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Hell, maybe they just decide to go retribution on you &#39;cause they think you&#39;re getting too full of yourself.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Either way, the only ending you&#39;d get is a bad one!</p><p><strong>Paris:</strong> Oh yeah, that sort of thing happened all the time!</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> I see. It sounds like Greece had its fair share of troubles as well...</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Then again, you wouldn&#39;t be the first to hide your face under a mask. Pency used to do the same thing.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Pency?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> You know, the Berserker who&#39;s always flying off the handle?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Real short? Abs that could grate cheese?</p><p><strong>Paris:</strong> (Apollo&#39;s getting a bad feeling about this! Abort! Abort!)</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> What was her real name again? Oh, right!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Pencil-Lilia!</p><p><strong>Penthesilea:</strong> You mangled my name on purpose! DIE!!!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Huh\u2013WAAAH!</p><p><strong>Penthesilea:</strong> (Huff, huff...)</p><p><strong>Penthesilea:</strong> (Glare)</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> For the record, I swear on my honor that I never said anything untoward about you.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> That said, I should have stopped Lord Jason before he shouted your mangled name. For that, I sincerely apologize.</p><p><strong>Penthesilea:</strong> ...Very well. But I should mention that I have no desire for there to be any bad blood between us.</p><p><strong>Penthesilea:</strong> Come with me to the simulator.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Does that mean you wish to fight?</p><p><strong>Penthesilea:</strong> I would have let you go if you were a Caster, but as you are a Saber, you should be capable of defending your honor yourself.</p><p><strong>Penthesilea:</strong> Unless, of course, that sword of yours is just for show?</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> ...I suppose you&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Besides, I could learn a great deal by facing one of Greece&#39;s fiercest warriors in mortal combat.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Very well then, let us do battle.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Penthesilea:</strong> I have seen the truth of your words in the strength of your sword arm. Very well then, our battle is concluded!</p><p><strong>Penthesilea:</strong> I accept you as a fellow warrior and now trust your word that you meant no disrespect!</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Thank you, Lady Penthesilea.</p><p><strong>Penthesilea:</strong> By the way, that mask of yours...</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Yes?</p><p><strong>Penthesilea:</strong> I assume you do not get moisture buildup on your face when you are fighting while wearing it? That must be nice.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> That&#39;s right, I don&#39;t. This mask only covers my eyes, so there&#39;s plenty of room for air to circulate.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Of course, it also extends up past my face, so I have to be careful when going through doors and such.</p><p><strong>Penthesilea:</strong> Hmm... I see.</p><p><strong>Penthesilea:</strong> The climate may have been largely responsible for this, but I always found quite a lot of moisture built up in my mask when I wore it in battle.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Was it the kind that covers your entire face?</p><p><strong>Penthesilea:</strong> It was. I cannot tell you how terribly I felt the urge simply to scratch my nose on countless occasions.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> And so Penthesilea and our subject continued their pleasant conversation about masks.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>When it was over, they both went merrily on their way, much to my relief.</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> I-I only mangled it on purpose a little bit...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>Jason, of course, remains clueless.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> 6:00 p.m.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>The subject suddenly goes silent.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> I&#39;ve been looking the other way since you didn&#39;t seem to mean any harm, but now that you&#39;ve been following me around all day, I feel compelled to ask.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> What is it you want with me, Lord Blackbeard!?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> ... ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You wanna run that by me again?</p><hr><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> I just told you! What&#39;s the freaking deal with that pretty boy!?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Prince of Lan Ling? More like Prince of OP Super Hotties!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> I mean, I know Chaldea&#39;s always had more than its fair share of hunks, but he just takes it too far!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou. Fooou...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Take Bartholomew. He might act all dandy, but it doesn&#39;t take long to see he&#39;s a gross creepfest on the inside!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> So you just know that Lan Ling guy&#39;s got to be hiding something too!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> So you&#39;re jealous of him? Is that what this is about?</p><hr><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Me? Jealous? Of him? Pfft. No way. Not in a million years.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> I just figure nobody could actually be that perfect, so there must be something we&#39;re not seeing.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I don&#39;t know. He seems pretty perfect to me.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Well, I don&#39;t buy it. Guys like that always end up having some kind of weird fetish or something they don&#39;t wanna tell anyone else about, guaranteed.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> So what if there is?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Well, if there&#39;s something we&#39;re not seeing, I wanna see it, dammit!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Besides, it&#39;s just human nature to want to find fault with anyone who seems too good to be true!</p><hr><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Which is why I&#39;m not going to rest until I&#39;ve uncovered the truth about him!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Wooo, let&#39;s do this thing! Gimme a C! H! A! L! D! E! A! Gooo Chaldea!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What was that all about...?</p><hr><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> And so, I have returned with my findings!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Long story short:</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> He&#39;s handsome on the inside too!!!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> (Sigh) What a letdown.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Th-that&#39;s why you were following me around all day?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I have to admit, you really were a perfect gentleman...</p><hr><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Now don&#39;t you start too, Master!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Right!? Just look at how carefully he placed his hands when he caught Murasaki!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> See how he did his best to avoid touching her skin even as he made sure to support her head?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> If I didn&#39;t know better, I&#39;d have sworn I was watching a scene straight out of a visual romance novel (the kind that induces serious blushing).</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Incidentally, scenes like that are called \u201CCGs\u201D in some games, depending on the genre.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> The more you know, amirite!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I-it really is like poetry in motion...</p><hr><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> When did you even record that?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Oh yes, I&#39;m not too proud to admit that my inner badump circuit was running like crazy while this was going down.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I didn&#39;t even know you had a...whatever that is.</p><hr><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Oh sure. It&#39;s right between my heart and my stomach.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Once it spins up, you get palpitations, flop sweat, fever, flushed skin, dizzy spells, weak knees, and hyperventilation, though not necessarily in that order.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> You know, now that I think about it, I really should look into getting that circuit removed!</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Um... Master? Could we please make that...man stop?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yeah, I guess we should. (That circuit sounds like seriously bad news)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> True, this has definitely gone on long enough.</p><hr><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Oh yeah? Then let&#39;s take this outside! I know I might not look it, but I&#39;m still an ultra badass pirate!</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> (The fact that it&#39;s true only makes him that much more difficult to deal with...)</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Hehehe... What a lucky break for me, getting to fight on a ship.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Are you sure you didn&#39;t touch the simulation&#39;s settings!?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Heh heh heh.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> If you think that&#39;s all I&#39;ve got in store for you, you&#39;re gravely mistaken.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> What?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Let&#39;s just say that Blackbeard is never alone!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You mean there&#39;s another one of you? Oh gods, please no.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Thank you for your honesty, Master. It&#39;s much appreciated.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> We hope you&#39;ll continue to enjoy Blackbeard brand products for many years to come.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You mean you&#39;ve still got crew members!?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Hehehe. You won&#39;t find the sad sack Blackbeard who used to lie on the ground weeping tears of loneliness here anymore.</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Er, not that he ever existed to begin with, of course.</p><hr><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> All right, tactician, come forth!</p><p><strong>Chen Gong:</strong> Good day, everyone. I am Chen Gong, the tactician Lord Blackbeard just spoke of.</p><p><strong>Chen Gong:</strong> I&#39;m a busy man, of course, but as I was told this is a time-sensitive matter, I decided to leave my errant tasks for later and drop by.</p><p><strong>Chen Gong:</strong> And by time-sensitive matter, well... I trust you know of what I speak?</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> (Um, Master?)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> (I think I can already see where this is going...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> (Just be ready to run for it at a moment&#39;s notice!)</p><hr><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> All right, let&#39;s do this thing! By the way, tactician, can I ask why you&#39;re standing directly behind me?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Chen Gong:</strong> I know what you&#39;re thinking, so before you even ask: it was a necessary sacrifice.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> If you say so...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Gaaah! I really thought I was done for!</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Who knew just activating Guts took so much energy...</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Easy there. Are you all right, Lord Blackbeard?</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> ... ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> THIS is the music they&#39;re playing now!?</p><hr><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> Oh man, I finally got that event CG I wanted after all...</p><p><strong>Blackbeard:</strong> I can feel my badump circuit whirring around... Pretty soon, I&#39;ll be my own little Blackbeard Restoration Labyrinth...</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> (No earthly idea what he&#39;s talking about)</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> This has been a very tiring day...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I bet!</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Lord Blackbeard seemed very dejected when he left...</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> I do hope he&#39;ll be okay.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It was kind of refreshing seeing you perturbed for once, though.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> You know, you can be kind of mean-spirited sometimes, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Still, I haven&#39;t had a day like this in a long time. For that, I owe Lord Blackbeard my thanks.</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Having your day turned upside down by someone you least expected may seem exhausting from the outside...</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> ...but if nothing else, there&#39;s certainly never a dull moment.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Welcome to my life.</p><hr><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> Oh, right! I guess you do experience that all the time, don&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> In that case, Master, would you like to swap war stories with me tonight?</p><p><strong>Prince of Lan Ling:</strong> I suspect that both of us have plenty of tales of hardship we could tell.</p>',271),s=[a];function i(g,h){return o(),n("div",null,s)}var l=t(r,[["render",i],["__file","Lanling Wang.html.vue"]]);export{l as default};
