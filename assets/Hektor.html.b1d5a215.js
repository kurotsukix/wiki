I&#39;m your Servant now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m not on edge.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;m not worried.</p><hr><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> I see. Good. So anyway, there&#39;s something I wanted to talk to you about.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> Mind if I ask you too, Mash?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> N-Not at all. Go ahead...</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> Okay, well I&#39;ll get straight to the point. I&#39;m not using all of my power right now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Going easy?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You&#39;re strong if you tried?</p><hr><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> Right. Of course, I&#39;m not trying to go easy or anything, and I could be powerful if I tried, you know?</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> But my Noble Phantasm... It&#39;s gotten a bit weaker.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Durandal, right? I think you called it... Durindana, was it?</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> Yeah, that&#39;s the name, I think.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Wouldn&#39;t it be better for you to remember its True Name?</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> Well... Ha, ha, ha. To be honest, I don&#39;t really care what lance I have as long as I can throw it.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> It&#39;s natural for great swords and lances to break left and right on the battlefield.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> And even if it didn&#39;t break, it&#39;s lost once you throw it. So you learn to make do with whatever you&#39;ve got.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> To be honest, this old man can even kill someone with a single stone. Whether they&#39;re a Heroic Spirit or not.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> Well, in any event. This lance is legendary in later generations.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> I need to get it sharpened again, ya&#39;know. Let me see. As long as I can cut down 100 more people with it\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Then how about you do some training in a programmed simulation?</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> A virtual battle, huh? I guess I can&#39;t be picky.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> Master, what do you think? Want to help this old man with some training?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Guess I have to.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Not a problem.</p><hr><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> Good. Quick answers like that show one&#39;s true nature. You&#39;re a great Master after all.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> All right. Let&#39;s go.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Okay, we&#39;re here. So about those enemies\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> How about we get started with the humanoid ones first?</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> Okay, we&#39;ll use that for warm-up, then. All right Master\u2013give me your orders!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> I&#39;m starting to get the hang of this. Let&#39;s kick it up a notch.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> Master, add fifty more! Raise the level just a little, too!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> G-Got it. I&#39;ll summon some ghost-type enemies next.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> All right. You can&#39;t kill fog by piercing or cutting it\u2013</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> You must scatter it, like a raging storm!</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> Give me your orders, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> Whew.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Confirming the elimination of all ghosts. The next set will be the last.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> If we&#39;re on the last set, then bring me a really strong one next.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> If you want, I can even take on a dragon.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> In that case\u2013I&#39;ll summon a dragon-type enemy for you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Are you serious!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You&#39;re joking, right!?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh? That was a joke? I already started the summoning process!</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> It&#39;ll be fine. No problem. My duty is to protect my Master.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> You know this old man, when it comes to holding the line, guard duty, defense\u2013</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> Basically, anything involving protecting something or someone... I&#39;ve never lost before.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> The Achilles thing was different!</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> Now Master, give me your orders! As your shield and fortress\u2013I pledge to fight, yeah?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I&#39;ve confirmed its defeat! That was impressive, Hektor.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> Yeah, yeah. This old man pushed himself a bit too hard. My shoulders and back hurt all over.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> I think Durindana&#39;s got its sharpness back a little. Guess I&#39;ll call it good for now.</p><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> Anyway, let&#39;s head back. \u2013Oh, yeah. I guess I can be a bit more useful from now on?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Of course.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Please continue to lend us your strength.</p><hr><p><strong>Hektor:</strong> I see. Then I&#39;ll do the best I can.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I&#39;m not sure if this is the case, but maybe that ocean battle was on Hektor&#39;s mind?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> To him it might be the distant past, but to us it&#39;s like yesterday.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So maybe he&#39;s trying to show he can be a good Servant...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I trust him.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I suppose you&#39;re right. That&#39;s what a Servant is, after all.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> He is the one who answered our summons, so I&#39;m sure that&#39;s a happy thing and not a troubling matter.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Let&#39;s continue to have him fight by our side.</p>',87),a=[n];function g(i,h){return o(),r("div",null,a)}var l=t(s,[["render",g],["__file","Hektor.html.vue"]]);export{l as default};
