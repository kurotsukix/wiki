I don&#39;t have that kind of &quot;emotion.&quot; \u2013But still...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Could that be... &quot;something&quot; that is unattainable?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> There I was, thinking such foolish thoughts.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Good morning, Senpai. ...Um, how are you feeling?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You look a little pale...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m fine.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Really? You&#39;ve been fighting battle after battle lately. Fatigue could be building up in you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It might be better to rest up today. I&#39;ll let the Doctor know.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh, Fou. ...Can you look after Fou?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> OK.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Sure.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Great, thank you very much.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong> ...Fou?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...I&#39;m sleepy...</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...ster...Master, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> ...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Oh, thank goodness! This is no place to be sleeping.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Where am I?</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I do not know either. Most likely, this is France, I think...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Mash! Master just woke up.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master! Thank goodness you&#39;re all right. I&#39;ve finished scouting the area.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> At the moment, I couldn&#39;t detect anything unusual.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Communication with the Doctor has been severed, which bothers me...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master, do you remember anything before ending up here?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Not really...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I was afraid of that. ...It&#39;s the same with us too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> When I woke up, we were in this world. Master, for the time being, let&#39;s set up a camp.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The Doctor will notice something is wrong, and then he&#39;ll find a way to get us out.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> At the meantime, we&#39;ll explore this world. If we find anything unusual, we&#39;ll fix it\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> How does that sound?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I think that&#39;s fine.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Good. All right, let&#39;s get going.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Such a lovely breeze. It stirs in me the feeling I&#39;ve returned to my hometown.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Is that so...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I was raised in Chaldea, so I don&#39;t really get that kind of feeling...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But since you seem so happy, Jeanne, I&#39;m glad for you.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I-I am sorry.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Jeanne, your hometown is Domremy, correct? I wonder if it&#39;s close to here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> If you&#39;d like, why don&#39;t you pay them a visit?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I&#39;m afraid France is a very large country... I can&#39;t ask the both of you to accompany for that long.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Besides, I don&#39;t believe I should return.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> When I decided to save France, I made up my mind that I could never return to my village.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Is that so...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Have you ever thought about returning?</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...Hmm, you asked a cruel question, Master. Yes, I have thought about wanting to return.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Many, many times. Especially whenever I felt the burning sensation in my old arrow wound.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But you never returned.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> No. Even if\u2013everything went well, and there was nothing to prevent me from returning.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...I just felt that I should not return. I mean, I threw it all away.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> My family, my village, everything.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You can&#39;t be serious...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Hehe. It&#39;s all hypothetical anyway. I was captured, and put to the flame.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> It&#39;s all over now.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> If we were to change that, I would end up like how Gilles was then.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> \u2013But, I don&#39;t understand why.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> On every occasion, people assumed that I have regrets.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But...that really can&#39;t be helped.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> You see, people tend to have regrets about their life\u2013 For simply being young.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Yes, you&#39;re right. That is quite correct.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Time...If I had time, I would&#39;ve done what I wanted to do. Or, I would&#39;ve done the things I couldn&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...Even if I didn&#39;t have either... I could at least have found something that I wanted to do.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Humans have unlimited possibilities, and the younger you are, those chances skyrocket.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> But I simply threw that away. I was a fool, and certainly no saint.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Really? Then, I too have\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You too, Mash?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Oh! No, I mean ...It&#39;s nothing. Forget about that, Master. I can see a town.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Let&#39;s go. We must find out what era, and the situation we&#39;re currently in\u2013</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...I think...they&#39;re fine with me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So it appears.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Thanks to the Dark Jeanne&#39;s rampage in 1431, you got caught in a bad situation...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But this town looks peaceful.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Thank goodness. If it&#39;s peaceful, there&#39;s nothing that could be better.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What&#39;s the matter?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> The castle flag... It&#39;s the flag of England. This place must be...under England&#39;s control.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, that certainly isn&#39;t the flag of France.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Is this one of the situation... That needs to be fixed?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Certainly if they&#39;re oppressed, but it feels unnecessary for now. We shouldn&#39;t accidentally cause any trouble...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...Absolutely. That is absolutely right, but...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> No, I&#39;m sorry. That was just my personal feeling. I am entirely your Servant now, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> At any rate, let&#39;s gather some information in the town.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Excuse me.</p><p><strong>G\uFF1ACitizen:</strong> Yes? What is it?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Actually\u2013</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Pardon me. May I have a moment?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1ACitizen:</strong> What do you need?</p><p><strong>G\uFF1ACitizen:</strong> Hello, there. What would you like?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> There&#39;s something I&#39;d like to know...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master! This is terrible!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Did you find something?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> A surprising change after all!?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> No. Nothing has happened.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...Yes, that&#39;s right. The town is peaceful. Only tiny squabbles that the law could easily resolve.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> But it seems in this world, England defeated Charles VII, and all of France came under his domain.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> That means...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> That&#39;s right. I am afraid\u2013&quot;I do not exist&quot; in this world.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> There&#39;s really nowhere else left for us to investigate. I guess we could check out the castle, but that&#39;s it.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> But...I find it hard to believe thatEnglish soldiers would allow us in.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, you&#39;re right. At any rate, let&#39;s get out of here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> We weren&#39;t able to find any leads at all... I&#39;m worried about tomorrow.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Tomorrow is...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, I know, tomorrow is another day. Hehe. Thank you for saying that.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ... ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Oui?</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Oh, I&#39;m sorry. I was praying to the Heaven...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Has Mash...gone scouting?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> \u2013Master, can I speak with you?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...At the end, this world is the epitome of peace.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> England has set up a proper government.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Though it seems the French armies were slain\u2013 it happened quite a while ago.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Master... Apparently, I was never in this world.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> France did not rise in defiance, was defeated, became the domain of England\u2013and now enjoys peace.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> There may have been many twists and turns, conflicts and other problems...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> But they overcame them. ...They were able to overcome it.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I do not exist in this world. It means...my very existence...was a waste...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I don&#39;t think that&#39;s true.</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...Thank you. But, it&#39;s peaceful. There no longer is a heart-rending war.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> It&#39;s possible that I might even be in Domremy. I could be living my life peacefully in that village.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Common upbringing, common prayers, even a common romance.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Do you want to see?</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...Just a little. But, I feel it would bring me pain afterwards.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I&#39;m sure that the me over there is happy. So I want to pray for her, just a little bit more.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Master, go and join Mash and Fou, all right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master, where&#39;s Jeanne?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...I see. This indeed is a world where Jeanne doesn&#39;t exist\u2013it is the epitome of peace.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But there&#39;s something wrong about this.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> If Jeanne doesn&#39;t rise, and France is not a reality, there will be big implications on history to follow.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I have...a strange feeling about this...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s too peaceful.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, that is absolutely right. This world is almost too peaceful.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> There&#39;s no trace of disturbance anywhere in the town. You&#39;d think there&#39;ll be more resistance for a land that was taken by force.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> There was absolutely nothing wrong in the town\u2013 To me, that&#39;s actually more odd.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Let&#39;s take Jeanne back to town with us and look again. We need to dig deeper, I think.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...What&#39;s this...!?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1ACitizen:</strong> Hello there. How are you?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1ACitizen:</strong> Oh, what&#39;s the matter? What do you need?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...The current time is...1AM...right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> In this era, it would be safe to assume most people would be asleep by now already...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> But the streets are just as busy as during the day. ...I knew it, something is off!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> \u2013Let&#39;s head for the castle. The only place we didn&#39;t investigate during the day was that castle.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Sure!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> This is...!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> There&#39;s blood everywhere...and I am sensing a colossal amount of magical energy.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> The wandering ghosts...are...French soldiers...!? No, there are Englishmen among them, too!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> They&#39;re attacking us! Master, orders, please!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Take this!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s finally...over.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> The spirits of those dead soldiers... Wandering this world with regrets. It&#39;s just too many of them.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> But in the town, there was not a single ghost.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...Wait, who is in charge of the town to begin with?If there are no soldiers here, then what are they\u2013?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I don&#39;t know. But one thing is for certain. This door won&#39;t open any more.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Which means...they don&#39;t intend to let us get away.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...Let&#39;s move on. I still sense something demonic deeper inside the castle.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I hear footsteps. Several of them...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Remnants?...No, it doesn&#39;t appear so.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Wait, these are...werebeasts?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Master, orders please!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> How did those monsters get here?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It makes no sense to me either. However... I do feel that you&#39;re the key, Jeanne.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Me? True, this France is my homeland.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I will certainly not allow anyone to ravage it\u2013 ...Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What is it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Notice something?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Jeanne?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Yes, that could be it...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> We must hurry to the throne! Most likely, this will solve this mystery!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Wha...? Are we facing...a demon next?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Stay calm, Mash. That is only a monster that looks like a demon.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> The one they serve\u2013is you, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>???:</strong> Eeeheeheeheehee! Right you are! Right you are! It is I who controls this demon!</p><p><strong>???:</strong> My name is Mephistopheles! I am a Servant granted the class of Caster!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> It&#39;s you...!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Oh, so you know who I am? Is it possible that we have been allies?</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> In that case don&#39;t worry! I have been summoned by someone else.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> That is to say, I can kill you all without any problem!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Ugh...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Mephistopheles...is your name, right? I have one question for you.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Do you? Then out with it.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> What is it with this charade?</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> That, you see\u2013</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Are you trying to tell me that everything I did was pointless?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Or possibly, since France does not exist now\u2013</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Are you testing me to see if I will raise my banner and rally the people?</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> My, my! That is an excellent answer! I applaud you! A great round of applause, everyone!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> So, what of it? How does that make you feel?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> To be honest, It certainly makes me feel awful. But in the end, this is all a fantasy.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I have nothing to fear from a fantasy.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> However, what about a logical fantasy?</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> This town is an actualization of the assumption, &quot;what if you never existed.&quot;</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Jeanne d&#39;Arc! O Holy Maiden of Salvation!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> You alone do not make the world go round! Nay. Whether you act or not...the people are happy!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Neither a king nor a hero, and to borrow your own words, neither a saint as well\u2013</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> How dare you worry about the world&#39;s transformation!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What&#39;s wrong with it?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Who asked you? My question was meant for Jeanne d&#39;Arc\u2013</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> It&#39;s exactly as you say. ...I may have been meaningless.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Heheheh.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> \u2013However, does one only act if there is meaning?</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> ...What did you say?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> The fate of mankind is bright, vibrant, yet cruel.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Just as life can be full of meaning, death can also have equally as much significance.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> People act when it&#39;s &quot;meaningful.&quot; People don&#39;t act when it&#39;s &quot;meaningless.&quot;</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Acting or staying immobile while knowing the future. To me, that is not what humans are.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> \u2013Let me put it clearly!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I&#39;m not looking at the future. I merely head down the path I have chosen for myself.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Let me be even more explicit. &quot;Tomorrow is another day&quot;\u2013That&#39;s all there is to it.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> That is my answer. Tell that to whoever hired you.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> ...I see. I see. I see. I see!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> So, your heart will not break. In that case! I will have to physically break you.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> ...No. Wait a moment. I haven&#39;t been able to make really witty comments.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Could it be that I am the one that broke? Could it be? ...Yes, it could be!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Take this world as it is. Even if you have no hope, and all you have is despair.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...So people, without halting, can keep their chins up and move forward.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Regardless of brambles, regardless of pitfalls. I will\u2013choose a path where I can march forward!!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Heheeheeheehee! Is my role to be over so soon!?</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Well, I guess it&#39;s all right! If I am over there, tell myself that I said hello, all right?</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Kind regards for the mischievous Mephistopheles! Until we meet again!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...I&#39;m so sorry for getting you involved in this, Mash and Master.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> It seems that you and I must again ...fight one more fight together.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> This is a fight challenging what I believe in.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> If you would, please, Master. Will you join me?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Of course.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I promise.</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...Thank you, Master.</p><h2 id="my-god-is-with-me-ii" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#my-god-is-with-me-ii" aria-hidden="true">#</a> My God is with Me II</h2><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Seventeen years living in that village. Seventeen years with my family.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Peaceful days spent helping out my parents and praying at the church. A precious time in my life.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...But I threw it all away. I left it all behind for the sake of victory.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Master... Master, please wake up. ...Oh, what a relief. You&#39;re awake.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Where am I...?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> It appears we are on a deserted island. Well, not deserted now that we are here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Could this be...?</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Master. I believe I am to blame for this. I&#39;m very sorry for causing you trouble in such a busy time...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Don&#39;t worry about it.</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...Thank you very much, Master.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> As for our present situation... It seems there is nothing on this island.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> It is small. I do not sense anything demonic... But there are no caves, and nothing man-made either.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Which means...?</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> It appears that we are inside a dream, like last time.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> And there is one more thing that I have noticed: this time around, we are not in a place from my memory.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...I&#39;m embarrassed to say this, but I&#39;m at my wits&#39; end.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> What shall we do...?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Wait a moment. It appears...that there&#39;s no need for us to simply sit and wait.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> See!? There&#39;s a ship. It looks like it is coming towards us...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...I sense very strong magical energy coming from that ship. Something is definitely up.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What do you mean?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Based on the situation, it&#39;s likely some torment from my past, like last time.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...But the theme this time around is strange.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I may have seen the sea, but I&#39;ve never been aboard a ship...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Should we ignore it?</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Well, as we are alone on an island in the middle of the ocean, getting passage on that ship would seem to be our only choice.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Um...unless you are saying that you want to enjoy a leisurely vacation on a deserted island, Master...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> In which case, I will do my best to make that happen!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> No, please! That&#39;s not it!</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Hehe. I know.</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Our only problem is that it&#39;s unclear what kind of people are aboard the ship.

Let&#39;s continue our course.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> In the end, man always seeks to make the impossible...possible.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> This is at once a diabolical power and a ray of hope, a desire to make the unknown...known.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...Yes. That is what being human means.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> That very fiendishness is precisely what led to so many discoveries in the Age of Exploration.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Conversely, the desire for righteousness and justice can make people commit acts of unspeakable cruelty\u2013like when I was burned at the stake.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Man&#39;s vices can be forgiven...

Impossible...!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Wh-why, why are you here!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Jeanne...?</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Why are you here!? Mother...!?</p><p><strong>Crewman:</strong> Oh come now. You don&#39;t even know the half of it yet!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> ...Hello, hello! Long time no see! It&#39;s been, oh, a few days since we last met, I believe?</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Everybody stop!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Mephistopheles! What the hell are you...!?</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Well, they&#39;re just background characters. I wouldn&#39;t want them to cause trouble, so just ignore them.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> ...Now then, Jeanne d&#39;Arc. Excluding me, there are two people left on board this ship.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> One is your own mother!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Thank you so much for coming all the way from France!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Just kidding! Keheeheehee!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> But wait, there&#39;s more! Our last guest of honor needs no introduction...but I&#39;m gonna do it anyway!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> He is...the filthy bishop who, under England&#39;s orders, led you to your execution at the stake!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> A real human dumpster fire... The man who was bribed for his judgment, who consigned your soul to the flames!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> The man who laughed and jeered while you were burning. Yes, you should know who it is by now!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Pierre Cauchon!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Eeexaaactly! Now let&#39;s untie these two!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> This won&#39;t hurt one itty-bitty bit, okeydokey?</p><p><strong>Pierre Cauchon:</strong> ...P-p-please don&#39;t pull... Ouch! Ow! Ow! Ow!</p><p><strong>Mother:</strong> ...Oh, Jeanne...</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Oh, but that ship of yours? It can only carry one more. Let more than that aboard...and it will surely founder!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Now, Jeanne d&#39;Arc! Make your decision!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Who will you save? Your mother, who has loved you your entire life, or this old geezer who scorned you to the very end?</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Well? Well? WELL!? Whatcha gonna do!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...Oh. The answer is easy.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Huh?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I will simply get off. They can have my place.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> ...There was not a bit of hesitation there. Shoulda seen that coming!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...Mother. You are probably an illusion...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> But I&#39;m glad I could see you once more. Now, please, board our ship.</p><p><strong>Mother:</strong> B-but...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Bishop Cauchon. ...You go too. Hurry.</p><p><strong>Pierre Cauchon:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Pierre Cauchon:</strong> I-I am not wrong. You are a witch!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...And that is fine. What a stubborn man you are.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Come back!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> No. This is the right thing to do. I&#39;m very sorry, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;m going with you!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Wh-what a surprise.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I don&#39;t know what to say, Master... I&#39;m happy, but such an attitude will lead to an early death for you!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I&#39;m one to talk? Y-yes, that&#39;s true, but...!</p><hr><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> ...How could you forgive a man like Pierre Cauchon?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> My mother&#39;s sadness will fade one day, just as, in time, my distaste for the bishop will disappear too.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> It is the sole province of God to judge what is evil. As humans, all we can do is fight against it.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> This man may never have my forgiveness, but salvation is a different matter.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> If it&#39;s possible, I shall save him. However many times I must.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> But didn&#39;t you hear what his last words were? There was not an ounce of remorse in them.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> It is not for me to demand remorse, regret, or repentance. After all, humans cannot be other than what they are.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...Mephistopheles. This ship is going to sink, correct?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> You should move over to our ship one as well. You may be a Servant, but I&#39;m sure it would still be a problem for you if you were to be stranded out at sea.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Oh my. You really are an interesting person...to your own detriment!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> But to the individual who had summoned me, I&#39;m sure this is such a buzzkill!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> I&#39;m sure they are positively apoplectic right now!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> So now I shall demonstrate that your choice was a mistake!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Eh...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> A Noble Phantasm!?</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Wha...!?</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> I did not want you to take this game so seriously! This is merely an imitation! A sham!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Ah, but then again, these things are imitations that are so very close to being real.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> At least, your real mother would probably have reacted the same way. And even Pierre Cauchon would definitely say what he said!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Mephistopheles...!!!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> ...Ehehehe! Very good! I do so ADORE that look on your face!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Master! That ship is no longer safe! Please jump over here!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> O-okay!</p><hr><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Aha. So Master&#39;s come too. Well then... Come, my Shadow Servants!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Shadow Servants...! Just who are you working for!?</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Oh, don&#39;t you worry your little head about that. It&#39;s playtime!!!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Keeheeheehee! I lost again!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> You were a strong opponent!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Kahahahahahaha! That&#39;s not how it was supposed to be, Jeanne d&#39;Arc!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Our loss was determined the very moment you chose to sacrifice your own life without hesitation!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Why? Don&#39;t you get it? I am the great demon, Mephistopheles!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> If you don&#39;t fall from grace, the only other choice is for us to lose!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Well, looks like I&#39;m still going to get overworked! Thanks for playing!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> See you again! Byeee!!!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> He disappeared again. It doesn&#39;t seem like we defeated him, though...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Still, I&#39;m starting to understand what his intentions are.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Let&#39;s do our\u2013</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Master? Um, are you by chance...mad?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You shouldn&#39;t throw your life away recklessly.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Errr... But at that moment, there were no other options...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Well I, um, thought that would be the best solution...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Please don&#39;t die.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Um. Th-that line really gets to me...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> But in that situation, the only choice I could have made was to do what\u2013</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I know.</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I&#39;m glad you understand!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m still mad.</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...I-I-I&#39;m sorry!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I know! Chaldea! When we get back to Chaldea, I&#39;ll treat you to anything!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Whether we go to Boudica or Emiya... It&#39;ll be your choice!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> My journey will continue. But the end is also on the horizon.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Even if that journey ends, I would like to continue traveling with you, Master. To fight as a Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Protecting humanity. Protecting virtue.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> That is what I wish for, and nothing more.</p><h2 id="my-god-is-with-me-iii" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#my-god-is-with-me-iii" aria-hidden="true">#</a> My God is with Me III</h2><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...I don&#39;t feel pain from being burned. ...I don&#39;t feel grief from being cursed.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> The only thing I feel is immense, overwhelming heartbreak.

We are long since past that! Yes! Long since past!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Sadly, our present situation is sliiightly less than ideal for sleepyheads!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Why is that, your pleading eyes ask? The answer is simple.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Because the way things are going, the world will soon be destroyed!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> ...All right, let&#39;s go over this world.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> As I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve already guessed, this is a non-dream dream. You know, that old saw.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> There&#39;s no getting in touch with Chaldea here. We may as well be cut off from the entire timeline.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> The only place this world connects to is itself.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> I believe it belongs to Jeanne d&#39;Arc.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> And your task here is to destroy it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Okay...so what about you?</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Ooh, harsh! Well, you know, I have my own reasons for being here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> What are you doing here, Mephy?</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Maybe I&#39;m here because, of all the Servants in Chaldea, I&#39;m the closest there is to everyone&#39;s image of the Devil?</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Oh, and I also have my own connection to that Ruler, as you know.</p><hr><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Now, on that note, let&#39;s be on our way! The final battlefield awaits!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Oh, I do beg your pardon.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Final battle or no, even I must admit that showing up dressed like the Devil would be in poor taste!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> So, without further ado...!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong> What do you think? Now I look just like any other soldier!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Wow, that&#39;s handy...!</p><hr><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong> Of course, it might be easier to just cast a perception inhibitor spell and be done with it, but this way is more fun.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong> Now then, you there, soldier. It sounds like the whole town is abuzz. Pray tell, what might be going on?</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> Oh, they&#39;re about to hold an execution.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong> An execution, you say?</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong> Aye, they say Jeanne d&#39;Arc finally confessed to heresy.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Wha...!?</p><hr><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong> My, my, whatever are we going to do now?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong> Historically, this is where she is meant to be burned at the stake.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong> Even if, hypothetically speaking, we were to Rayshift in and save her at the last second...</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong> ...the end result would almost certainly be the same.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong> Whether Jeanne is burned at the stake, or ends up dying of old age...</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong> ...her role in history has come to an end, and I doubt it would have any other effect.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong> If she succeeded at avoiding the stake and tried to stand on history&#39;s stage once more, I imagine there would be secret efforts made to...you know.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Assassinate her...?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong> Indeed. I imagine Charles VII, or perhaps someone else, would betray her, and she would meet a bloody end nonetheless.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Betray her?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong> Indeed. I&#39;m guessing she would be betrayed again, and end up getting murdered anyway.</p><hr><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong> Aaanyway, none of that matters in this world!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong> There may be nothing to stop us from leaving her to her fate, but there is nothing stopping us from saving her, either!</p><p><strong>Citizen:</strong> It&#39;s Jeanne d&#39;Arc!

Give her a good stoning!</p><p><strong>Citizen:</strong> Is God going to punish all of us for this? Or just the priests carrying it out?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Wait a second. That Jeanne is\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong> Indeed, she is. Or isn&#39;t, rather.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong> That&#39;s neither Jeanne the Rogue Servant, nor the actual Jeanne from history.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong> That&#39;s Jeanne d&#39;Arc...the Ruler.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong> Which perhaps means that if she&#39;s burned at the stake now, she may just cease to be your Servant.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> What!? We&#39;ve got to do something!</p><hr><p><strong>Prosecutor:</strong> Order! We will now carry out the sentence of execution on Jeanne d&#39;Arc!</p><p><strong>Prosecutor:</strong> This girl claimed she was a saint! She claimed that she heard the voice of God! She defied the Church!</p><p><strong>Prosecutor:</strong> She had no compunctions about engaging in the worst kind of heresy. She is beyond redemption!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong> My, oh my. This is true of all these sorts of witch trials, of course...</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong> ...but I do so enjoy this gloomy atmosphere!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong> Hm? Why are you looking at me like that? Do you think I&#39;m not normal or something?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> To put it lightly. <strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong> Oh...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Yes, but then again, you are Mephy, after all.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong> Hohoho, you know me so well! No wonder you&#39;ve been able to keep me on as a Servant!</p><hr><p><strong>Prosecutor:</strong> Do you have anything to say for yourself, Jeanne d&#39;Arc?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ... ...</p><p><strong>Prosecutor:</strong> ...It would appear you do not. Very well, light the fire!</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong> ...So, what are you going to do now, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m going to save her.</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong> Ahh, just as I thought! In that case, I think I&#39;ll join you!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Are you coming with, Mephy?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong> Oho. So your going to save her is a foregone conclusion, and the only question is whether I will be joining you, hm?</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong> Of course I will!</p><hr><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong> But first, another change of clothes...</p><p><strong>E\uFF1AMephistopheles:</strong> Ah tah ta tah\u266A Let&#39;s go do this thiiing\u266A</p><p><strong>A\uFF1AProsecutor:</strong> Hm?

Soldiers, kill that jester!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Nobody&#39;s killing meee!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Ah... You...!?</p><p><strong>Prosecutor:</strong> Khh...! Never mind that! Just light the cursed fire!</p><p><strong>Prosecutor:</strong> So what if the Devil has come to save the witch!? Kill them both and be done with it!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...Please, stop this. Don&#39;t...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Sorry, but I can&#39;t leave you to burn!</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I mean it! This is wrong...!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I...I&#39;m supposed to...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> That doesn&#39;t matter!</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Master...!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...I...</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> ...You wished for it, didn&#39;t you, Jeanne?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Huh...?</p><p><strong>Prosecutor:</strong> You said it, you said it, you said it! We heard you, we heard you, we heard you!</p><p><strong>Prosecutor:</strong> You did all hear that, didn&#39;t you everyone? [\u2642 He /\u2640\uFE0F She} said it plain as day, didn&#39;t [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she}?</p><p><strong>Prosecutor:</strong> Fujimaru said [\u2642 he /\u2640\uFE0F she} was going to save Jeanne d&#39;Arc! And what&#39;s more...she herself asked to be saved!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> That&#39;s right, Jeanne d&#39;Arc has wished to be saved! Now, Jeanne. Darkness has awoken within you!</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> That&#39;s enough of the jester act! It&#39;s time to show who I really am.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> What the...!? You&#39;re...!</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AMephistopheles (?):</strong> My, my, oh my, my, my. What can the humble prosecutor Mephistopheles do for you?</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> What the? Another one of me? You know, I could swear something like this happened before.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...This must be the next part of that dream... And that must mean you&#39;re here.</p><p><strong>D\uFF1A???:</strong> Figured it out, did you? Well, I guess it was getting kind of obvious by this point.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> A version of me dressed in black...! But I thought you disappeared after the Holy Grail was collected!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...It did. Since I was the Holy Grail, I was fated to disappear once it was collected.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> But it turns out that the Holy Grail was nothing more than my source of magical energy. I exist because that&#39;s what Gilles wished for.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Even after the Grail was recovered and that time period repaired, his wish remained.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Nor did the wish itself ever disappear. In which case, why wouldn&#39;t I still exist?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> That said, I&#39;d lost almost all of my power. If I&#39;d been left to my own devices, I would have disappeared...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> But then...you stopped me, Jeanne.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> You acknowledged my existence without even realizing the truth.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> You discovered your own dark side...one that was never meant to exist in the first place.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> But...I...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> That&#39;s right. You didn&#39;t accept me. You said I couldn&#39;t possibly exist.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...And you were right. But I still had something to say about it.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong></p><p>I exist!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Whatever the circumstances of my creation, I was still created!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...But even though I could advocate for my own existence, there was only so much else I could do.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Namely, create a small world, summon Mephistopheles, and poke whatever darkness you had inside.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...Sure, my last two attempts might have ended in failure.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> But this stake...that was immutable.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> This was the place where Jeanne d&#39;Arc&#39;s dreams came to an end.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Even if Jeanne herself had given up and decided to offer herself to the Lord...introducing a third party changes things considerably.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Especially one who wishes for nothing more than to save her, and is willing to act on that wish.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> In other words...</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Now do you get it? That&#39;s right! I&#39;m talking about you, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> You&#39;ve gone and proven that Jeanne d&#39;Arc did have a secret desire to escape her fate!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> In her very last moments, she saw hope in you.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> And so she wanted to be saved! She wished for it! Desperately!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> But she thought that wish was wrong, was evidence of her own dark side!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Once she decided to abandon what was right and cling to her own life, that was the moment I took root inside her!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> My, my, you don&#39;t say. Is that true, other me?</p><p><strong>C\uFF1AMephistopheles (?):</strong> Oh yes, quite true. Hmm, it&#39;s rather difficult to tell us apart, isn&#39;t it? Let me give myself another name.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles (Enemy):</strong> I&#39;ll be Mephistopheles with \u201C(Enemy)\u201D after my name.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles (Enemy):</strong> Jeanne d&#39;Arc&#39;s other half summoned me here.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Of course, just about everyone wants to stay alive, and there&#39;s really nothing wrong with that.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> But for her and me...that wasn&#39;t true.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Right, Jeanne?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Ghh...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Jeanne!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I was careless... I never expected to be forced to acknowledge her like this...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Are you okay!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...Yes. But, it looks like...I really did end up acknowledging her.</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> But we can talk later. Right now, we need to stall her!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> This is it, Mephistopheles! The final showdown!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles (Enemy):</strong> Indeed, indeed. Everyone, I would just like you to know that I&#39;m truly sorry about this. ...Release!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Khh...!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> My, my. What shall we do now, Master?</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> I really must say that I think retreat remains an eminently viable option.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...Good point. I suppose I am in your debt.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> If you want to wake up now, that&#39;s fine with me. Do that, and I&#39;ll let you go.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> It&#39;ll be just like you never had a Ruler at all.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> That&#39;ll take care of everything.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> But...if you&#39;re planning on defeating me, not that you could...</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...Well, at that point you saving my life won&#39;t matter. You&#39;ll get no mercy from me.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles (Enemy):</strong> I&#39;d get out of here if I were you. Go on, other me, persuade them!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Good point. All right, here&#39;s my attempt at persuasion.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Master, I&#39;d get out of here if I were you.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> That shock alone has already transferred over half of Jeanne&#39;s power to her Alter.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Even if I joined you two, we&#39;d all be hopelessly outmatched!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> You do remember what your obligations are as the Master destined to save humanity, don&#39;t you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Yeah, I remember.</p><hr><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> ...Then what&#39;s your answer?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;m going to save her!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I had a feeling you were going to say that!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I&#39;m going to fight, and I&#39;m going to win!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> I knew it!</p><hr><p><strong>Mephistopheles (Enemy):</strong> Oh, my, what happened, other me? That wasn&#39;t very persuasive at all.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Of course not!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> If you think this is enough to stop [\u2642 him /\u2640\uFE0F her}, you don&#39;t know Chaldea&#39;s Master at all!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Wooo! That. Was. Awesooome! I just wanted to say that, naturally!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Whatever you say.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Gah! My eyes!</p><hr><p><strong>Both:</strong> ?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Master, are you sure about this?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I&#39;m at less than half my full power right now. We may both be Rulers, but she has the upper hand.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I&#39;d bet the two Mephistopheles are evenly matched, too. There&#39;s no way we can win.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Even knowing all that, are you sure you still want to fight?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> We&#39;ve both seen worse, right?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> You didn&#39;t run.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...No, I didn&#39;t.</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> That way of thinking isn&#39;t going to get you very far. But, then again, that might be why I was summoned in the first place.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Even if I am just a ghost who only happened to exist at one point...I think I can still help you.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles (Enemy):</strong> So we&#39;re going to fight after all, are we? What a shame.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Indeed. I&#39;m a pacifist, I&#39;ll have you know!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles (Enemy):</strong> But, I guess that&#39;s okay!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> After all, I&#39;m Mephistopheles. I make fun of saints and demons alike!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles (Enemy):</strong> You know it!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles (Enemy):</strong> Okay, ghostly boys and girls, I hope you like playing with fire, &#39;cause the Dragon Witch is about to roast you alive!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...Everything else aside, having two of him around is extremely confusing!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Couldn&#39;t agree more!</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...Ugh, that clown is a real pain. Well, at least I can fight jester with jester.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Now, what are we going to do about these scattered memories of yours?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Specifically, this group of ordinary, decent folk whipped into a mob frenzy!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Look at the anger on their faces, just like monsters! Hmm... I think I&#39;ll go ahead and turn them into REAL monsters.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Well, Jeanne d&#39;Arc? Think you can defeat me now!?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I don&#39;t know if I can defeat you, but my pennant is telling me I have to try.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Let&#39;s go, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> The Lord forgives all sin and wickedness. He rescues the lives that crawl forth from the grave, grieves for them, and takes mercy upon them...</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles (Enemy):</strong> My, my, how impressive! It looks like ghosts just aren&#39;t enough to put up a decent fight anymore!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles (Enemy):</strong> In that case, how about this? Come on up, anonymous Servants!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Shadow Servants!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> What, them? Those are just a few shadows that happened to be hanging around.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> They&#39;re not even self-aware. Trust me, we have nothing to worry about!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Got you...!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles (Enemy):</strong> My, my, so you did! Well, Master? What&#39;s the plan now?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re worried I might lose? You know they call me the Dragon Witch!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> I wield disaster as a weapon. I was made to sow despair wherever I so much as breathe.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Oh no. Don&#39;t tell me...!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Wooo! That&#39;s amazing! I haven&#39;t felt my eyes almost pop out of their sockets like that in a long time!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Faf...nir...!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> That&#39;s right! Fafnir, my adorable personal dragon. And this time...he&#39;s going to rid me of the righteous Holy Maiden once and for all.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...Even so, I am not going to lose!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> It doesn&#39;t matter who you call to come fight on your behalf! We&#39;ll beat them all!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> What, because of God&#39;s blessing?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> In part. The Lord is always by my side...always helping, even if only a little.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> But the other part is, of course, thanks to my friends and my Master.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> They console me when I&#39;m powerless to do something, and pick me up when I slump in defeat.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> That&#39;s all the salvation I need.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I may not have been saved in history, but I know their desire to help me is genuine.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...I see you&#39;re as much of a teacher&#39;s pet as ever. God, you piss me off.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Fine, then. Let&#39;s settle this once and for all. We&#39;ll see who wins: me and my dragon, or you and your Master.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Let&#39;s have a nice pleasant duel to the death, Jeanne d&#39;Arc!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Just what I had in mind. Come at me, Fafnir, Mephistopheles.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Come at me...my other self who fell from grace. The Alter I once so vehemently rejected!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Wonderful. Then this will truly be the final showdown! At last, her long and winding journey will come to an end!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> I&#39;ll back you both up with all I&#39;ve got!</p><hr><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> No...way...</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles (Enemy):</strong> Welp, looks like we lost...</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles (Enemy):</strong> But then again, I suppose there was only so far I could go as a jester. What a shame. Maybe we should invite someone more fun to join our little party.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles (Enemy):</strong> Then again, maybe the Counter Force went easy on us, pitting me against you?</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Not at all. If anything, I think it was a dreadfully cold-blooded decision. This Lord guy seems like a real sadist, if you ask me.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> After all, if I hadn&#39;t been here, that woman you&#39;re with would never admit defeat.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> The fact that you and I are equally matched means that she has only herself to blame if she loses.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles (Enemy):</strong> Ohhh. Nooow I see!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles (Enemy):</strong> Well, there you have it, Master. I&#39;m so terribly sorry.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles (Enemy):</strong> It may not have looked like it, but I really was doing my best out there, you know?</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> How...? It shouldn&#39;t have been possible for me to lose!</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> You lost your power! I was the one who took it!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I didn&#39;t defeat you alone. We did it together.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...Yes, I did end up creating you. But I didn&#39;t regret that at all.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Instead...I was happy. Happy to know I was actually the sort of person who wanted to live on more than anything.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Happy to know I was the sort of ordinary person who felt joy at seeing others come to her rescue.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> So I was genuinely happy to see that Master didn&#39;t think twice about saving me.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I didn&#39;t fight as a Holy Maiden. I fought you as just another Servant, and I won. That&#39;s all there is to it.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> That isn&#39;t about faith, however weak or strong it might be.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...What a disgrace. Guess this is really it for me.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> Nothing I did worked out, right to the end...</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d say that. I did acknowledge you as the darkness that exists inside me.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> You&#39;re another side of my Heroic Spirit. You could end up getting registered as an Anti-Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Who knows? Maybe there will come a time when your power will be exactly what is necessary to save the day.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> ...Is that supposed to be a joke? I&#39;d rather disappear forever than get dragged into something like that.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> But if I have no choice, I hope I can at least change my class first.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Alter:</strong> I&#39;m not cut out to be a Ruler.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> ...And that brings my story to a close. Master...thank you for everything. Sincerely.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> You know, thinking back on it now...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> I kind of get the impression this was all my fault...</p><hr><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Yes, it may well be.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> But isn&#39;t that how it is with friends and allies? I know I&#39;ve made plenty of trouble for you.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Besides...it&#39;s like I said earlier.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> This made me really happy.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> I was so happy I got to see you running in to save me.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> No other reward could possibly compare to that.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> That goes for you too, Mephistopheles. I was so happy that you came to save me.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Reeeally? I&#39;m not used to this sort of thing, so I&#39;m not quite sure how to respond to that.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> But, as long as you enjoyed yourself, that&#39;s all that matters. Even better if it made you smile!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> Ahh, it really is fun being a Servant.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong> This little adventure truly was like a dream come true, so to speak! Well, see you later!</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Haha, whatever you might be, devil or otherwise...there&#39;s nothing more beautiful, or more fun, than joining forces and fighting together.</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> All right, Master, what do you say we awaken from this dream?</p><p><strong>Jeanne:</strong> Your journey to protect humanity is still far from over, after all...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> ...And so ends one of the stories of Jeanne d&#39;Arc.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> Jeanne would go on to experience many things, and eventually, an Avenger of her would be born as well...</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong> But that...is a story for another time.</p>',858),a=[r];function h(p,g){return t(),o("div",null,a)}var l=e(s,[["render",h],["__file","Jeanne d Arc.html.vue"]]);export{l as default};
