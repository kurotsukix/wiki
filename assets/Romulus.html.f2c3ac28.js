My Rome is alive and full with people as ever today!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> We no longer face the threat of the United Empire, smiles have been back on Rome&#39;s, my dear Romans&#39; faces.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> How wonderful. I&#39;m in a great mood today. Indeed\u2013</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> It&#39;s sad I won&#39;t see Fujimaru and Mash ever again, but I&#39;m the emperor of Rome!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> As long as my people have smiles on their faces, all I need is to reign over and govern Rome with unlimited love!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> My talent has no limit, and neither does my love. The applause of roses will always resound in Rome!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> I&#39;m so excited! Which song should I sing today?</p><p><strong>Romans:</strong> Oh, I see her Imperial Majesty over there! She&#39;s as bright as Apollo, and as beautiful as Venus!</p><p><strong>Romans:</strong> Long live her Majesty! Hurray for Emperor Nero Claudius!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Umu. Keep on, I&#39;ll allow for the applause.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> If there&#39;s one thing to be added, I&#39;m also as talented in art as a Muse.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Now let me sing! Young girls, come here and hold flowers!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Honor of Imperium is here! I&#39;ll sing with my sweet voice to people throughout the capital, no, the whole land of Rome.</p><p><strong>Romans:</strong> Oh, wow! Look, her Imperial Majesty is about to sing!</p><p><strong>Romans:</strong> We&#39;re blessed, but you have to put up with it! Don&#39;t lose your concentration, otherwise you won&#39;t last!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Hehe, even the people passing by are excited! I&#39;m so happy. This is the Rome I love!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> ...Whew! That was a great recital.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> But those orchestra folks that rushed to join. Isn&#39;t their performance a bit too loud?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Didn&#39;t it drown out my sweet voice and block my singing from reaching my people?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> I understand that they get excited, but I need them to remember to be patient.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Anyway, I spent the whole morning singing. I should work on some official business in the afternoon\u2013</p><p><strong>Burrus:</strong> Your Majesty. I bring news.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Oh, my Knight Burrus. What&#39;s the matter?</p><p><strong>Burrus:</strong> From the provinces ruled by the United Empire, we&#39;ve received letters from the viceroys and director-generals who went missing.</p><p><strong>Burrus:</strong> I&#39;m sorry to bother you, but I&#39;d appreciate it if you can read it.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Umu, Burrus. What you just brought in is nothing less than good news!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Hand over their letter to me. I&#39;ve been concerned about them.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> (If what Mash and others said was true, all the matters associated with the fake United Empire)</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> (will disappear without a trace at some point. But, umu. For now I should just read the letters.)</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> (My dear vassals. How did they survive from the attack of the United Empire?)</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> (I should learn that. I&#39;m already someone who&#39;s killed her own mother\u2013)</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> (All that&#39;s left is to continue to be the Emperor. I believe my love will reach both my vassals and my people)</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> (...Isn&#39;t that right, O Romulus?)</p><p><strong>Burrus:</strong> \u2013Your Majesty?</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Sorry, I think I got a little tired from singing. But not to worry.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Give me the letters. I&#39;ll make sure to hear what the governors and others must say!</p><p><strong>Seneca:</strong> ...Your Imperial Majesty. You seem to be pushing yourself too hard.</p><p><strong>Seneca:</strong> It&#39;s already late at night. You should rest soon.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Oh, Seneca. Hehe, thank you for caring for me.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> I got a stack of official work to deal with. I wish there were a few more of me so it wouldn&#39;t take this much time.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> But that wouldn&#39;t work either. For I am the one and only in Rome!</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Hehe. It&#39;s okay. I&#39;m glad to hear you say that to me.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Once, when my mother was alive\u2013</p><p><strong>Seneca:</strong> Your Majesty.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Oh... Well, excuse me. Never mind what I just said.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> I&#39;ve noticed my migraines are coming back. Indeed this prevents me from finishing my work.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Certainly, I think I&#39;m a little tired. I&#39;m going to bed now.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> ...Can I ask you to sleep by my side, private tutor?</p><p><strong>Seneca:</strong> Please stop kidding. But I&#39;m glad you changed your mind.</p><p><strong>Seneca:</strong> Please rest well. You are our only Roman Emperor.</p><p><strong>Seneca:</strong> You should never push yourself too hard. Your recklessness will lead to Rome&#39;s recklessness.</p><p><strong>Nero:</strong> Umu. That makes sense\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...No one is here. Nero appears to have gone to her bedroom.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fou.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Wow, Imperial Privilege EX is incredible! It shut off your presence completely!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Besides, not only Romulus himself, but both Mash and Fujimaru as well.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I wonder which skill he used? Um, is it possible to tell us\u2013King Romulus?</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Romulus?</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Excuse me\u2013</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Are you worrying about Nero?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Sure. To Romulus, Nero is like a &quot;descendant,&quot; I suppose.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Rome?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Huh, Senpai?</p><hr><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> Every Roman is my child. Nero Claudius. One of my beloved children.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> With such a tiny body, the fragile girl tries to support everything in the far-off land, Rome.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> I, Rome, witnessed love in her. It&#39;s not gods&#39; love, and yet not human&#39;s love, either.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> It is exactly... One of many forms of love a Roman emperor ought to possess.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> Even if that path heads to none other than the Underworld itself\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Yes.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Right. In several years from now Emperor Nero&#39;s political power becomes weak, and she loses the support of everyone under her.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I cannot tell her the truth, but sadly, it&#39;s just how the history is.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> Even if everyone rejects her, even if the gods reject her.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> I, Rome, shall never reject her. Nero Claudius is great.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> She is\u2013 truly a great &quot;Roman emperor.&quot;</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> Therefore, leave immediately. The &quot;emperors&quot; attracted, gathered by my divine radiance.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What\u2013</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What did you just say? We just came to check up on her, didn&#39;t we?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Wait, I&#39;m picking up something\u2013 It&#39;s a extremely powerful reaction, but different than a Servant!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> A more vague existence. A ghost-type monster perhaps? But this is too powerful for something naturally created.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> Augustus\u2013!</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> Tiberius, Claudius! O, Trajanus! Hadroanus, Severus!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Names of the emperors of the ancient Roman Empire?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Ah, I got it! Those ghosts are the &quot;emperors&quot; themselves!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Those &quot;emperors&quot; were chain-summoned by Romulus&#39;s existence, attracted by it.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fooou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> I can sense hostility in their magical energy. Senpai, this is going to be a battle!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Let&#39;s get ready for battle!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, Master! Your orders, please!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> Rome!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> What! S-Senpai?</p><hr><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> Emperors from the past! Emperors from the future!</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> You must all leave now! You certainly are Rome, but now is the time of Nero!</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> The short-lived United Empire is no more! Hence, O, my children, gathering in the void!</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> \u2013Behold my spear!</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> This spear I hold is Rome. Hence, you shall\u2013</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> Return to Rome through my spear. O, O, Magna Voluisse Magnum!</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> \u2013Rome!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> The battle is over. All hostile targets were destroyed.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> ...Rome will never collapse. Even if all the Roman emperors end up crawling on the ground.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> Rome will continue to shine in the past, present, and future. I, Rome, can see that.</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> Look, heavenly gods. Behold my Rome, no\u2013</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> Behold Nero&#39;s Rome, one that lasted longer than mine. Beautiful. This moment of beauty is infinite.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Okay.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> I think I can understand, or maybe not. Hmm. What exactly is he saying?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> It&#39;s Rome</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong> It&#39;s Rome</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> ...Oh, sure Senpai.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Huh?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Wait a second. Mash, you just gave up on thinking, didn&#39;t you? And Fujimaru, you&#39;ve been\u2013</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> Rome...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Rome...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes. Rome, it is. Somehow\u2013I started to understand it.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fooou.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Wait, wait, wait! I still don&#39;t get it, what is it?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Doctor. No matter what history says, at least Nero is shining at this time.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong> So, she&#39;s all right as she is. I think he&#39;s saying...something like that.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Oh, that is... what it is?</p><p><strong>Romulus:</strong> Rome...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong> Fooou...</p><p><strong>Roman Soldier:</strong> It&#39;s right here, Lord Seneca! We&#39;ve sensed an unusual presence from the Throne Room!</p><p><strong>Seneca:</strong> Build up the defenses around Her Majesty&#39;s bedroom. I need four soldiers to follow me to the Throne Room!</p><p><strong>Roman Soldier:</strong> Yes sir!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong> Uh-oh, they&#39;ll find us! Now, let&#39;s Rayshift out of here!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong> Rome!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong> Yes, Senpai!
