We did it!</p><p>D-Director!</p><p>Director, it&#39;s not safe here! Please evacuate!</p><p>Our second defensive barrier has been breached!</p><p>What is the director doing in there?!</p><p>I&#39;ve got to hurry.</p><p>Yes. I did have to hurry.</p><p>I didn&#39;t have even a second to spare.</p><p>That&#39;s a nice fragrance.</p><p>Darjeeling, as usual?</p><p>As long as it&#39;s drinkable, it could be water for all I care.</p><p>I&#39;m glad to see you in good health, Archaman.</p><p>Though I hear you won&#39;t be continuing as a magus.</p><p>I&#39;m doing the best I can with the knowledge and skills I have now.</p><p>An excess of modesty is itself closer to bragging.</p><p>But I did feel that might be the case.</p><p>So, where are you now?</p><p>Well, I never did find a place that felt right.</p><p>Actually, I have a favor to ask you.</p><p>If you&#39;re willing, I&#39;d like you to take me on here.</p><p>What do you say?</p><p>All right.</p><p>It all starts here, Romani Archaman.</p><p>Existences recorded within the collective knowledge of humankind, known as Heroic Spirits, can be given physical form using mana and commanded as &quot;Servants.&quot;</p><p>Furthermore, a Heroic Spirit unable to materialize by itself could be made to possess the body of a human being, thereby becoming what was called a &quot;Pseudo-Servant&quot;\u2014 but our experiment&#39;s goal was something else altogether.</p><p>A fusion of Heroic Spirit and human\u2014 a living weapon with a conscious will.</p><p>The Demi-Servant Project.</p><p>That&#39;s what you&#39;ve been working on for over a decade.</p><p>That&#39;s right.</p><p>I&#39;ve raised a number of test subjects for that purpose.</p><p>Of all the subjects, she was the most ideal.</p><p>But the Heroic Spirit that fused with her refused to cooperate with us and went silent, leaving her without a Servant&#39;s powers\u2014 only the immense physical strain.</p><p>Not quite.</p><p>We did succeed in activating the Relic.</p><p>Using it as a catalyst will allow us to perform more stable experiments with the Heroic Spirit System.</p><p>Servants are an invaluable factor in the preservation of human history.</p><p>A successful Rayshift is only half the battle\u2014 we also need to prepare a stockpile of weapons.</p><p>But now work can begin on a more stable summoning system, all thanks to her noble sacrifice.</p><p>But she&#39;s a Designer Baby.</p><p>Her rate of cellular decay was already high, and the experiment may have accelerated it even further.</p><p>On the other hand, her fusion with a Heroic Spirit will allow her physical body to remain at its peak.</p><p>She won&#39;t age, even as her cells degrade.</p><p>She&#39;s lucky, don&#39;t you think?</p><p>She doesn&#39;t need to fight.</p><p>All she has to do is continue to live.</p><p>She&#39;ll accompany Team A as a catalyst for summoning.</p><p>I don&#39;t expect anything more from her, and I&#39;d rather you didn&#39;t either.</p><p>Let me be her personal physician.</p><p>Is that all right with you?</p><p>That depends. Are you asking out of pity?</p><p>No. I ask purely that you allow me to maintain her health as a doctor.</p><p>Her condition is very precarious.</p><p>I don&#39;t think anyone else can ensure that she&#39;ll live two more years.</p><p>Very well.</p><p>Senpai?</p><p>Oh, no. I was only appointed to Chaldea five years ago, so if anything, you&#39;d be my senpai.</p><p>Nice to meet you. My name is Romani Archaman.</p><p>I&#39;ll be your doctor from now on.</p><p>You can call me Roman.</p><p>Hm...</p><p>Dr. Roman.</p><p>Has a nice ring to it, right?</p><p>Roman.</p><p>A word that means &quot;an optimistic observation of the future as holding countless possibilities.&quot;</p><p>Is that right?</p><p>Wow, you know a lot for a ten-year-old.</p><p>You really are my senpai.</p><p>The senpai-kouhai relationship is one of teaching and learning, but I haven&#39;t taught you anything, Doctor.</p><p>All of my knowledge was input by Sheba, so Sheba would be the senpai in this case.</p><p>Well, if you look at it that way, then I suppose so.</p><p>Yes. That fits my definition of what a senpai is.</p><p>I see.</p><p>I&#39;d interpret it a little differently.</p><p>The way I see it, if there&#39;s anyone who would truly be your senpai, it would be someone who&#39;s an ordinary human.</p><p>Someone who&#39;s an ordinary human?</p><p>A person who can live among other people and share the joy, sorrow, and anger that they feel.</p><p>Someone like that.</p><p>So a senpai when it comes to socialization and living life?</p><p>I suppose so.</p><p>And also someone who can focus on the long term, I guess?</p><p>Focus on the long term?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Someone who cares about their home and neighbors, whose heart is full of compassion for others.</p><p>Someone who sees people in need and acts to help them, no matter the reason.</p><p>In my opinion, this is the greatest virtue humans possess.</p><p>In other words, someone who is not egotistic but altruistic.</p><p>Would that not be a weakness?</p><p>To an animal, it would be a disadvantage.</p><p>I suppose that&#39;s true. Human beings are capable of thinking before they act, and they have to be able to make difficult decisions.</p><p>But that also makes them the only organisms to knowingly do things they know won&#39;t benefit them.</p><p>I find that fascinating.</p><p>I see. I will add these to the list of qualifications for my future senpai.</p><p>Are you not my senpai?</p><p>Nope. I&#39;m still far too inexperienced to qualify.</p><p>Now, as your doctor, there&#39;s something I&#39;d better talk to you about.</p><p>It&#39;s about your lifespan.</p><p>You were a Designer Baby.</p><p>That means your cells decay very fast.</p><p>Even if we&#39;re very careful about maintaining your health, your lifespan will be eighteen years at most.</p><p>First of all, do you understand that?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>All lifeforms can only operate for a limited duration.</p><p>I have no misconceptions concerning the length of my own operational period.</p><p>I see.</p><p>This is going to be even more difficult than I thought.</p><p>Are you referring to maintaining my health?</p><p>Ah, yes. There&#39;s that, of course.</p><p>But that&#39;s up to me.</p><p>As long as I&#39;m around,</p><p>I&#39;ll keep you alive and healthy.</p><p>The problem is...</p><p>No, never mind that.</p><p>In any case, let&#39;s do our best together, Mash.</p><p>This is utter folly.</p><p>Now, now. Settle down,</p><p>Successfully Summoned Heroic Spirit Number 3.</p><p>Or rather, Leonardo Da Vinci.</p><p>I&#39;m perfectly settled. But I&#39;m also getting awfully fed up with all this.</p><p>Safeguarding all human history?</p><p>With the paltry equipment they&#39;ve given us?</p><p>Not to mention those Demi-Servant experiments, which are not only inefficient but also inhumane.</p><p>There&#39;s not the slightest bit of beauty in it.</p><p>If I&#39;d only been summoned sooner,</p><p>I&#39;d never have allowed those mediocre fools to make such a mess of everything.</p><p>You have every reason to be upset.</p><p>This is all wrong.</p><p>I want to be truthful with her and acknowledge that what we&#39;re doing isn&#39;t right.</p><p>And you&#39;re a fool of an entirely different sort.</p><p>Hey, Romani, don&#39;t you think this is too cruel?</p><p>Do you know of any magic that can reveal the sky,</p><p>Professor Lev?</p><p>That&#39;s an unexpected question.</p><p>Well, all right.</p><p>It does exist, but it&#39;s rather pointless.</p><p>Does that answer your question?</p><p>Rather than try to make the skies above Chaldea blue, it would be far more economical to take a trip to Antarctica.</p><p>You&#39;d have much clearer skies out there, too.</p><p>I see.</p><p>I guess you&#39;re right.</p><p>But why do you ask?</p><p>Does the good doctor feel a touch homesick?</p><p>Not at all.</p><p>It&#39;s just...</p><p>So it&#39;s about Mash?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>I see. Very interesting.</p><p>I was invited to join Chaldea for my ability as a magus, in order to construct the Near-Future Observation Lens, Sheba.</p><p>In that capacity, I also served as Mash&#39;s teacher.</p><p>Though it was only in regard to magecraft,</p><p>I&#39;ve known her even longer than you now.</p><p>She was raised to be as pure and reticent as possible, in body and spirit, so that she could one day become the vessel for any Heroic Spirit necessary.</p><p>Mash is indeed very mentally stable.</p><p>The theory of her upbringing was sound.</p><p>No doubt ever enters her mind.</p><p>But the physical wounds she bears are extremely painful.</p><p>Every test she&#39;s subjected to hurts her.</p><p>And that pain can become fear, ultimately turning to hate.</p><p>No heart can endure torture forever and stay pure.</p><p>And yet, she...</p><p>As of now, she has remained pure.</p><p>That girl never compares herself to other people, Romani.</p><p>Thus she never feels envy or hatred toward others.</p><p>To her, every human is her senpai in terms of their lived experiences.</p><p>She looks up to everyone and accepts them for what they are.</p><p>No matter how much pain or injustice she endures,</p><p>Mash sees only the good in people.</p><p>She said there&#39;s nothing she loves more than seeing people smile\u2014 that it&#39;s all it takes to make her happy.</p><p>Come to think of it, I suppose that&#39;s true of us too.</p><p>It&#39;s a natural reaction, isn&#39;t it, Romani?</p><p>But aren&#39;t you curious?</p><p>After all, no one can tell what kind of person she&#39;ll grow up to be.</p><p>&quot;Pure&quot; is a pretty word indeed, but &quot;na\xEFve&quot; is an equally accurate one.</p><p>Once she&#39;s exposed to the ugliness of humankind and the corruption that permeates its history, will she still believe that people are good?</p><p>That&#39;s the one thing that still worries me.</p><p>What do you wish for?</p><p>The Holy Grail War is over.</p><p>We&#39;ve won.</p><p>...What will you wish for?</p><p>The completion of Chaldeas.</p><p>I care nothing for the Third Magic.</p><p>For an astromancer of the Animusphere line such as I, it would be unthinkable not to reach the Root via my own unique approach.</p><p>What about you, then?</p><p>What do you desire?</p><p>Oh, it&#39;s you.</p><p>You&#39;re five minutes late.</p><p>That&#39;s not like you\u2014</p><p>You want me to put a stop to Chaldeas, eh?</p><p>That&#39;s an awfully difficult request.</p><p>The preservation of humanity, or my own life\u2014 which is more important to me?</p><p>What a silly question.</p><p>What&#39;s happening to the flame of Chaldeas?!</p><p>All too soon, the day arrived.</p><p>Human history would cease to exist beyond 2016.</p><p>The phenomenon couldn&#39;t be explained.</p><p>Chaldeas frantically combed 2,000 years of information about the past to find the reason for the future&#39;s disappearance.</p><p>What they discovered was Time-Space Singularity F.</p><p>In the year 2004, at the site of a certain city in Japan, an unknown quantity that had never existed in history prior to 2015 was discovered: an area that was impervious to observation.</p><p>Chaldea determined that this was the cause of humanity&#39;s future extinction, and submitted their experimental Rayshift proposal to the UN, which approved it.</p><p>The Rayshift process converts humans into spiritrons, which are then sent into the past to intervene in events there.</p><p>In other words, it&#39;s a form of retrograde time travel.</p><p>And Mash was chosen to be part of Team A, which would carry out the First Mission.</p><p>The Director really doesn&#39;t like me, huh.</p><p>She says my nonchalance is contagious.</p><p>Well, there&#39;s nothing I can do about that.</p><p>It might not look like it, but I&#39;m charging ahead at top speed.</p><p>Excuse me.</p><p>It&#39;s occupied\u2014</p><p>Huh? Who the heck are you?!</p><p>Back then, I never questioned anything.</p><p>Not the pain I had to endure, nor the limited lifespan I possessed, nor my own existence.</p><p>None of the other doctors ever came into my room before.</p><p>Oh, is that right?</p><p>Chaldea&#39;s quite an advanced place if people here can convey their feelings even through glass.</p><p>I&#39;m still so inexperienced.</p><p>I don&#39;t know how to talk to people unless we&#39;re face-to-face.</p><p>So tell me anything you want about what you think or how you feel. Don&#39;t hold back.</p><p>It makes a huge difference in the volume of information we&#39;ll be able to get, and besides, it&#39;s a lot more pleasant this way.</p><p>Successfully Summoned Heroic Spirit Number 2...</p><p>No, from now on, I&#39;ll call you by name.</p><p>Hello. It&#39;s nice to meet you, Mash Kyrielight.</p><p>H-Hello. It&#39;s nice to meet you too, Dr. Romani.</p><p>If this reaction could be called &quot;human,&quot; then it was the first true &quot;human&quot; reaction I showed to anything.</p><p>Good morning, Mash! How are you feeling?</p><p>From then on, the doctor spent a great amount of time talking with me.</p><p>Every experience was new to me.</p><p>Everything I thought and felt, things I liked, things I considered important, things that were warm and pleasant.</p><p>Sometimes the Doctor told me funny stories about the facility, and sometimes I listened to him complain, but little by little, I started to develop an interest in the world outside my room.</p><p>Good morning, Mash!</p><p>I&#39;ve got some good news for you today.</p><p>Your vital signs have been excellent lately.</p><p>Your brainwaves are also very stable.</p><p>If this keeps up, you won&#39;t have to stay in the clean room anymore, and you&#39;ll finally be a full-fledged member of the Chaldea research staff.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>Oh, I know! When that happens,</p><p>I&#39;ll do something to celebrate!</p><p>Is there something you want?</p><p>A book, for example, or a toy, or a snack?</p><p>Isn&#39;t there anything?</p><p>If it&#39;s within my power, I&#39;ll make it happen.</p><p>I think I&#39;d like to go outside.</p><p>I&#39;d like to go outside and see a clear sky.</p><p>That was the only thing I wanted.</p><p>Unfortunately, Chaldea is located on a snowy mountain 6,000 meters above sea level.</p><p>The only thing visible outside is a blizzard.</p><p>But those rare nights when the sky is clear,</p><p>I hear you might get a glimpse of a beautiful starry sky.</p><p>I believe the day will come when you can see that sky for yourself.</p><p>Fou-san.</p><p>That was what I&#39;d called the mysterious creature that had grown attached to me as of late.</p><p>Have you ever seen the stars, Fou-san?</p><p>Looks like the sky won&#39;t be clear today either.</p><p>Fou-san?</p><p>Wait!</p><p>Please wait for me!</p><p>Whenever I\u2019m alone, I start to hear it speak hitori ni naru to kikoeru no</p><p>\u201CIf it hurts so much, why not give up?\u201D, it says to me kurushii nara yamete ii to</p><p>The sky was the first thing I&#39;d ever wished for.</p><p>It draws me in as crushingly as a black hole black hole mitai ni fukaku</p><p>Our King pitied humankind and declared that he would save them from the inevitability of death.</p><p>The terrifying yet bewitchingly sweet voice that speaks those words kowakute miryokuteki na amai koe ga</p><p>I cannot comprehend it.</p><p>Can you, Mash?</p><p>It tries to mimic your voice and the way you speak to me anata no kuchiguse wo manete</p><p>Does humanity truly hold such value?</p><p>So I pretend that nothing is wrong nandemo nai to itte miru</p><p>What you love, what you hate,</p><p>But even if that wasn\u2019t true, I wouldn\u2019t care at all sore ga uso demo kamawanai what you hold dear, and what you consider evil...</p><p>If it gave me the strength to get back on my feet again tachitsuzukeru douki ni nareba</p><p>It&#39;s all up to you to decide.</p><p>By coming to know many things and seeing many places,</p><p>Every lifespan draws to an end eventually subete no inochi ni owari ga aru no ni you begin to endow your life with meaning.</p><p>Listen well.</p><p>So why do humans fear and lament it the way they do?
